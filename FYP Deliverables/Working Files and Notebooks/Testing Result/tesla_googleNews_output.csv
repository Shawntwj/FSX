It notes in all caps that “bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed” and “if you input the bitcoin address incorrectly, your bitcoin may be irretrievably lost or destroyed.” Customers are also responsible for directly paying all bitcoin transaction fees associated with their purchase, and Tesla warns that although bitcoin payments typically take less than an hour to complete, this can extend to up to “one day or more.” And because of bitcoin volatility, Tesla warns that the value of any refund made in bitcoin “might be significantly less” than the value of bitcoin relative to US dollars at the time of purchase.","bitcoin, musk, pay, option, tesla, value, buy, cryptocurrency, paid, payment, customers",idiosyncratic,16.247969720842946

The probe covers 765,000 U.S. Tesla vehicles built between 2014 and 2021.

As CNBC previously reported, NHTSA's office of defects investigation kicked off a safety probe in August after the agency determined that Autopilot was in use before collisions between Tesla electric cars and first responder vehicles.

Tesla investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk violated an agreement with the US securities regulator and its board members failed to adhere to their fiduciary duties.
In 2018, Musk settled a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweet on taking the company private, agreeing to have the company’s lawyers pre-approve tweets with material information about the company.
Tesla shares, which had hovered near record-highs, lost their value by about a quarter after Musk said on Nov 6 he would sell 10 per cent of his stake if Twitter users agreed.
