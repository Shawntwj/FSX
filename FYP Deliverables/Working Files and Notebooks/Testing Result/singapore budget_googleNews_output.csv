The Government set aside a $100 billion war chest to tackle the pandemic last year, with most of the funds used to support businesses and help workers keep their jobs.
Trade association and industry experts told the virtual event that more can be done to help businesses access existing grants as applications can be cumbersome.
She said grants could distract companies from their business objectives as they tailor their goals to meet qualifying criteria.
Professor Sum Yee Loong, board member of the Singapore Chartered Tax Professionals, said the Jobs Support Scheme has kept many workers employed.","mr, expected, measures, tax, help, businesses, support, targeted, 2021, singapore, financial, grants, budget, dials, workers",Economic Crisis,8.17966200426893

The research team is pencilling Budget 2021 to see an overall deficit of $12.5 billion or 2.5 per cent of nominal gross domestic product.
For financial year 2020, Singapore's fiscal deficit is pencilled at $74.2 billion after allocating almost $100 billion to combat the pandemic.
Coupled with the fact that Budget 2021 will be the first Budget for the new term of government for the next five years, policymakers will likely be conservative in their fiscal planning, he noted.
Mr Gan said the upcoming Budget could revisit medium- to long-term measures to develop Singapore's advanced manufacturing capabilities and digital connectivity, and accelerate the Republic's industry transformation.","expansionary, singapores, uob, calibrated, economy, fiscal, 2021, billion, stay, singapore, cent, upcoming, budget",Economic Crisis,9.004372150894701

This will ensure that work pass holders come in where we most need them.

Airlines have blamed a patchwork of travel rules for depressed international travel demand, which is critical for their return to profit, and Omicron appears to be worsening that problem.

Qantas Airways chief executive Alan Joyce said his hope was that once more was known about Omicron, the 72-hour isolation requirement would be removed.","airlines, chief, seen, travel, shortlived, hope, rules, singapore, executive, asia, week, variant, restrictions, setback, omicron",pandemic,14.372927611021147
