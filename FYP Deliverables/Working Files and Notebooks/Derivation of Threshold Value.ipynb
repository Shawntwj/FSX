    "# Derivation of Threshold Value\n",
    "The threshold value will determine whether or not an event, by means of news listening/scraping, will pose a risk to the downwards supply chain. The methodology in doing so is to:\n",
    "1. Gather large pool of news articles that are not related to the trigger events identified (i.e. Pandemic, Military Conflicts etc.) \n",
    "2. Run these articles through our News Classifier module\n",
    "3. Observe the results and remove any outliers\n",
    "4. Derieve the mean value of the probability scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean value of all the probabilty scores will then be the threshold value for our News Classifier to determine if an event should be classified to a trigger event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a total of 1140 non-related news were used to derive the threshold value. More data can be collected subsequently to attain a value that could be more reliable. "
