Before the war, Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain and oilseed a month, while in March the exports fell to 200,000 tonnes, Mykola Solskyi told the newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda.
There are currently 57 vessels with 1.25 million tonnes of grain and oilseeds,"" Solskyi said.
They certainly did not plan to keep this grain on the ships for a long time,"" he added.
He said importers were already spending more and the situation with grain supply from Ukraine could push these countries to build greater grain reserves and this would also drive up prices.","['ukraine', 'used', 'export', 'almost', 'grain', 'oilseed', 'via', 'seaport', 'forced', 'find', 'new', 'route', 'port', 'blocked', 'war', 'ukraine', 'exported', 'million', 'tonne', 'grain', 'oilseed', 'month', 'march', 'export', 'fell', 'tonne', 'mykola', 'solskyi', 'told', 'newspaper', 'ukrayinska', 'pravda', 'currently', 'vessel', 'million', 'tonne', 'grain', 'oilseed', 'solskyi', 'certainly', 'plan', 'keep', 'grain', 'ship', 'long', 'time', 'added', 'importer', 'already', 'spending', 'situation', 'grain', 'supply', 'ukraine', 'could', 'push', 'country', 'build', 'greater', 'grain', 'reserve', 'would', 'drive', 'price']",ukraine used export almost grain oilseed via seaport forced find new route port blocked war ukraine exported million tonne grain oilseed month march export fell tonne mykola solskyi told newspaper ukrayinska pravda currently vessel million tonne grain oilseed solskyi certainly plan keep grain ship long time added importer already spending situation grain supply ukraine could push country build greater grain reserve would drive price,Military Conflicts
