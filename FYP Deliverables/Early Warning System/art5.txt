At least one shipping line operator has stopped sending Brazilian meat to Shanghai, the source said, instead offering clients the alternative of sending cargos to Xingang and Ningbo.
One big Brazilian meat exporter canceled the shipment of three containers, while another stopped booking new cargo, the source added.
Shanghai is the main point of entry for Brazilian meat imports to mainland China, which is Brazil's top trade partner.
China imported 723,370 tonnes of beef and 640,469 tonnes of chicken from Brazil in 2021, according to industry data, the largest consumer of Brazilian meat by far.
It is unclear how much cargo is being affected by Shanghai's lockdown and restrictions on new cargo bookings to Russia.
