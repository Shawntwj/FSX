    "# FSX Proof of Concept \n",
    "*by Graham Lim, Data Science Consultant for FSX*"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In this notebook, we will be demonstrating our **preliminary Proof of Concept (\"POC\")** for our **FSX Risk Decisioning Platform (the \"Platform\")**.\n",
    "This will be written in `python`, with explanatory notes given to explain each step of our proprietary process."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Concept Summary\n",
    "Conceptually, the Platform is a supervised machine learning (ML) media sentiment classifier that mines news articles automatically that deal with the subject of food supply risk, and predictively classifies them according to their risk labelling. This will utilize statistical ML models like those from `scikit-learn`, as well as Deep Learning/ Neural Networks, such as Google's open-source `BERT` Transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on that risk labelling, an automated text report with visualizations is generated with insights. Initially, this will employ standard template-based code. Future versions will incorporate unsupervised text generation algorithms (e.g. `GPT2`) and/or commercial text-generation software (e.g. `Arria NLG`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: Our POC has been designed for the sake of demonstrating capability and conceptual proof only, and is not strictly optimized for typical Machine Learning performance metrics (e.g. `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `f1 score` etc.) due to the small sample dataset used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## POC Contents:\n",
    "1. **Webscraping**: prototype code that scrapes a sample of articles from the web for news about food supply risk using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`, which are open-source libraries that help us scrape. Future versions will scrape the web as comprehensively as possible, beyond the sample. Future versions will have a far larger and statistically significant dataset that is scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cleaning and Labelling**: prototype code that transforms sample scraped news data into a Dataframe in .csv format, that is machine readable. We use the popular `Pandas` library for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We initially manually label the risk profiles of each news article in our sample data, for the sake of being able to train our prototype model. Note again that future versions will have a far larger and statistically significant dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing and Modelling**: The text that we scraped has to be pre-processed into a machine-readable format e.g. tokenization, stop-words removal, and lemmatization. We then run models from `scikit-learn` or a custom Neural Network e.g. BERT on this machine-readable data in order to predictively classify news text as falling into a particular risk category e.g. `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `neutral`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For the sake of simplicity in this PoC we will use `risky`, `neutral` and `stable` as our preliminary labels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report Generator**: our report-generation algorithm is intended to provide actionable insights based on that risk assessment. In our prototype here, the report-generator will provide the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Reiterate the risk label\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Describe which keywords in the article triggered our label to be e.g. risky\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Describe which entities are being discussed in the article\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Based on the risk label, the algorithm **recommends** via text that other suppliers of the food item in question be reviewed.\n",

    "Kaushal Trivedi defines `BERT` as a \"multilingual transformer based model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks. BERT is a bidirectional model that is based on the transformer architecture, it replaces the sequential nature of RNN (LSTM & GRU) with a much faster Attention-based approach. The model is also pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks, masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This allows us to use a pre-trained BERT model by fine-tuning the same on downstream specific tasks such as sentiment classification, intent detection, question-answering and more.\" (Source: https://medium.com/huggingface/multi-label-text-classification-using-bert-the-mighty-transformer-69714fa3fb3d)\n",

    "For our purposes, it is another model on top of `scikit-learn`'s ML models that can help us predict the correct risk label for a given set of news. The code below allows us to use a wrapper called `ktrain` that trains a BERT model on our news risk classifier:"

    "For the report generator to readjust risk-weighted scores from food suppliers, we will require not only the model-generated .csv file, but we'll also have to create professionally curated `risk matrices` of commodity suppliers worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to credit scoring, this will be based on proprietary risk-weighting methods pioneered by FSX.ai's supply chain and risk experts. A score is assigned to individual country suppliers, with the idea being that the higher the number, the more secure that supplier's capacity to supply a particular commodity is, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, because India is now the largest supplier of rice worldwide (~32.5% of worldwide supply), their supply risk score is higher than say Spain, which only accounts for 0.9% of worldwide rice supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also therefore means that negative news (resulting in a risk rating of `-1`) is more impactful on the new risk score for India than it is to Spain, and it suffers a `risk penalty multiplier` of `3.25`. Therefore, negative news about India's rice supplying capacity will result in its score being subtracted by `-3.25`, whereas Spain's penalty will only be `-0.09`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of our demo, we have employed this simplistic calculation. We also assigned risk scores and penalties arbitrarily for ease of demonstration. Again, our production model will incorporate the fully articulated risk-scoring calculations based on curated weightages divined from our supply chain and risk experts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, we create here a `sample risk score matrix of rice suppliers` worldwide for demo purposes:"

    "\n",
    "With a diploma in plastic mould technology, the 20-year-old had a foot on his chosen career ladder. His younger brother Aditya chose law, but Ashish had his sights set on plastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I want to start a business of my own,\" he said, explaining how he wants to recycle plastic to make day-to-day products at his own factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "India's coronavirus lockdown has thrown those plans into disarray. Educated but unemployed, Ashish Kumar is one of countless people across the globe whose social progress has been halted by the coronavirus that has infected more than 2 million people in India alone, and thrown the economy into reverse. With it, the aspirations of millions are fading.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years, people in rural India have been gaining prosperity and moving into what economists call a burgeoning middle class of consumers – those who earn more than US$10 a day, by some definitions. This group has been a keystone of plans for economic development in the world's second most populous country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the COVID-19 pandemic, India's economy is forecast to shrink by 4.5 per cent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. At least 400 million Indian workers are at risk of falling deeper into poverty, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Kumar is one of around 131,000 people whom local officials estimate returned from working around India to Gonda, the district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh that he left last June.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nationwide, about 10 million people made long, hard journeys back to rural villages they had left. Some have gone back to the cities, but many of those who had been sending back funds are still stuck in the countryside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in a factory in Baramati in the western state of Maharashtra, Kumar was earning 13,000 rupees (US$173) every month, more than twice his father's pay from a job in a grain market near Kumar's home village in Uttar Pradesh, a sprawling agrarian state. Of that, the young man was sending home around 9,000 rupees every month, much of which was helping to fund his younger brother's studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "No longer. Once a provider for his family, now he has become a financial burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kumar whiles away his time back home in the village of Dutta Nagar, bantering with friends in the muddy courtyard – they jokingly call it their \"office\" – outside the ramshackle primary school where he studied. In Uttar Pradesh, around 60 million of the state's population of more than 200 million lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said he has applied for several jobs at plastic factories in western Gujarat state and other parts of northern India but has not found work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No matter what,\" he said, sitting near his parent's single-storey home, surrounded by jade green paddy fields. \"I need a job.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PLASTIC FOR PRALINES\n",
    "\n",
    "As a schoolboy, Kumar was obsessed with plastics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chance conversation with a cousin who had studied plastic engineering got him hooked, Kumar said, and he started researching. In Dutta Nagar, where there were no Internet connections, that often meant asking one of a handful of locals with a smartphone to Google the opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kumar's ambitions were a world removed from his father Ashok's early years. The 47-year-old, who assists with weighing and pricing grain harvests, remembers when the family had neither enough food, nor proper clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slight man with a weather-beaten face, he never finished high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I thought that the children shouldn't fall into our rut. They should be pushed ahead,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kumar, who says he has never tasted a Ferrero Rocher praline, finished his diploma in Gujarat last June, and took the train to start work as a technician at an Italian-owned factory 1,500km away from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factory that employed him is run by Dream Plast India, a subsidiary of Gruppo Sunino, an Italian plastics maker with 10 plants around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The factory was first class,\" Kumar said. His contract included a monthly contribution from the company into a retirement fund and a bonus. Workers were served one meal every day, the supervisors were friendly, and the salary came on time, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Six days a week, his work typically involved overseeing two machines and a couple of contract workers. At the end of the day, he would relax with a game of badminton or watch wrestling on YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "His income over the past year helped his parents build a proper four-roomed brick home, after decades of living in a tumble-down mud hut where the roof let in heavy monsoon rains. It helped pay the fees for his brother to go to law school in Bahraich, an hour-and-a-half's drive away from their home village.\n",

    "Kumar first heard of the coronavirus in early March. When India's lockdown forced Dream Plast India to temporarily shut its plant in Baramati on Mar 21, he had enough cash to wait it out in town.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the pandemic swept through India, a survey of some 5,000 workers in April and May found 66 per cent of participants had lost their jobs, and 77 per cent of households were consuming less food than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government announced a 20 trillion rupee package promising free rice, wheat and pulses for millions of people and a programme to provide employment in rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even for those with work, trade unions and labour experts say conditions are deteriorating, for migrants particularly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In May, India's state governments issued health and safety guidelines for factories as they re-opened after lockdown, which included compulsory face masks, thermal screening, social distancing and frequent sanitisation. Union leaders allege many companies did not follow all protocols and cut corners, but they have not identified Kumar's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indian states including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat said in May they were looking to relax workers' rights, including weakening regulations on wages and working hours, to support industry. That proposal drew criticism from workers' unions and the ILO. The amendments have only taken effect in some states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kumar's factory, which reopened in early May, did not respond to a question on measures taken there, but Dream Plast India's managing director Nitin Gupta said in an email the \"company takes utmost precautions to adhere to the laws at all times\". He declined to elaborate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, Kumar and another worker Reuters spoke to said they did not feel safe to return.\n",
