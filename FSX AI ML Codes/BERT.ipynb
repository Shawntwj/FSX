    "Kaushal Trivedi defines `BERT` as a \"multilingual transformer based model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks. BERT is a bidirectional model that is based on the transformer architecture, it replaces the sequential nature of RNN (LSTM & GRU) with a much faster Attention-based approach. The model is also pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks, masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This allows us to use a pre-trained BERT model by fine-tuning the same on downstream specific tasks such as sentiment classification, intent detection, question-answering and more.\" (Source: https://medium.com/huggingface/multi-label-text-classification-using-bert-the-mighty-transformer-69714fa3fb3d)\n",

Researchers are pushing for India to focus on enhancing its production of crops other than rice, the country’s traditional staple, if it wishes to effectively address its triple threats of food security, climate change effects and malnutrition.   \n",

    "\n",
    "For the report generator to readjust risk-weighted scores from food suppliers, we will require not only the model-generated .csv file, but we'll also have to create professionally curated `risk matrices` of commodity suppliers worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to credit scoring, this will be based on proprietary risk-weighting methods pioneered by FSX.ai's supply chain and risk experts. A score is assigned to individual country suppliers, with the idea being that the higher the number, the more secure that supplier's capacity to supply a particular commodity is, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, because India is now the largest supplier of rice worldwide (~32.5% of worldwide supply), their supply risk score is higher than say Spain, which only accounts for 0.9% of worldwide rice supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also therefore means that negative news (resulting in a risk rating of `-1`) is more impactful on the new risk score for India than it is to Spain, and it suffers a `risk penalty multiplier` of `3.25`. Therefore, negative news about India's rice supplying capacity will result in its score being subtracted by `-3.25`, whereas Spain's penalty will only be `-0.09`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of our demo, we have employed this simplistic calculation. We also assigned risk scores and penalties arbitrarily for ease of demonstration. Again, our production model will incorporate the fully articulated risk-scoring calculations based on curated weightages divined from our supply chain and risk experts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, we create here a `sample risk score matrix of rice suppliers` worldwide for demo purposes:"

Educated but unemployed, Ashish Kumar is one of countless people across the globe whose social progress has been halted by the coronavirus that has infected more than 2 million people in India alone, and thrown the economy into reverse. With it, the aspirations of millions are fading.\n",

    "For years, people in rural India have been gaining prosperity and moving into what economists call a burgeoning middle class of consumers – those who earn more than US$10 a day, by some definitions. This group has been a keystone of plans for economic development in the world's second most populous country.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nationwide, about 10 million people made long, hard journeys back to rural villages they had left. Some have gone back to the cities, but many of those who had been sending back funds are still stuck in the countryside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in a factory in Baramati in the western state of Maharashtra, Kumar was earning 13,000 rupees (US$173) every month, more than twice his father's pay from a job in a grain market near Kumar's home village in Uttar Pradesh, a sprawling agrarian state. Of that, the young man was sending home around 9,000 rupees every month, much of which was helping to fund his younger brother's studies.\n",

    "The factory that employed him is run by Dream Plast India, a subsidiary of Gruppo Sunino, an Italian plastics maker with 10 plants around the world.\n",

    "\n",
    "His income over the past year helped his parents build a proper four-roomed brick home, after decades of living in a tumble-down mud hut where the roof let in heavy monsoon rains.
