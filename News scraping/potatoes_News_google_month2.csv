2,potatoes,LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Let’s find a cure for potato pox – Nanaimo News Bulletin,"To the editor,

Re: The humble potato needs rescuing from global forces, Opinion, Feb. 3.

This column was interesting. I doubt if anyone would dispute the gradual deterioration in the quality of what used to be the not-so-humble spud over the last couple of decades. What really surprised me in this tuberous ode was the absence of any reference to the odious and ever-present brown spots that make all varieties of today’s potatoes appear to have the measles. These brown spots gradually turn black and then slowly sink into the flesh of the potato. Given enough time they turn the flesh translucent and have to be dug out before cooking. What happened to the clean-skinned potato of my youth?

Growers and retailers alike have so far turned a blind eye to this situation. However it will have to be addressed eventually, hopefully prior to the further descent of this most versatile of vegetables into an amorphous mush. Let’s hope that somewhere, someone will know how to perform this much-needed restoration.

4,potatoes,"'SNL': Marjorie Taylor Greene gives NSFW science lesson, talks gender neutral Potato Head","""Saturday Night Live"" viewers just got a ""sience"" lesson they won't soon forget.

During this week's episode, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Cecily Strong) stopped by the Weekend Update desk to explain her views on gender to anchor Colin Jost.

Earlier this week, Taylor Greene drew backlash for placing a sign that read ""There are TWO genders: MALE & FEMALE. Trust The Science!"" across the hall from another congresswoman who has a transgender child.

Wearing a misspelled shirt that read ""trust the sience,"" Strong's Greene elaborated on her views.

""I love science,"" she said. ""I'm always talking science. Unless that science is about climate change, coronavirus, space lasers, evolution, the metric system, the rhythm method, breastfeeding, living on Mars, Jesus' skin color or Santa's skin color, by the way, which is white.""

After reciting an NSFW rhyme about anatomy, Strong's Greene explained that ""we're all endowed with traditional gender roles.""

""I'm a woman, so it's my job to bully, threaten and fight my female colleagues,"" she added. ""Scientists call these 'cat fights,' and it's what girls do.""

Strong's Greene also weighed in on another recent controversy: Hasbro's decision to rebrand the Mr. Potato Head toy as the gender neutral Potato Head.

5,potatoes,Digimon Adventure Welcomes a New Monster Inspired by... Potatoes,"✖

Digimon Adventure can do no wrong in the eyes of fans around the world. Even the franchise's more questionable moments can be explained away if you try hard enough... but some things can never be explained. For instance, Digimon has welcomed some very strange monsters to its catalog, and a brand-new one has joined the list.

If you did not know, Digimon Adventure is having a renaissance these days thanks to a big reboot. The original series has been re-adapted by Toei Animation for a new generation, so it makes sense for some brand-new monsters to show up. However, what doesn't make sense is the arrival of a potato-inspired monster who has no business being so cute.

First images for Potamon, a new Digimon that will debut next week.#Digimon pic.twitter.com/ropzbF3Twp — Digimon Tweets + Bowser's Fury (@JP_Excelsior) February 28, 2021

In the preview for the next Digimon Adventure episode, fans were shown Potamon for the first time. As you can see above, the monster is all sorts of adorable. The monster's toddling body is covered in brown peel, but it has chubby cheeks to offset the rustic shade. As for their hair, the monster has styled some potato wedges into a cute cut, but don't go thinking this partner is an easy target. The promo shows Potamon spraying potato juice from his mouth, so yeah - that is pretty much disgusting.

This new monster is just one of many that Digimon Adventure has introduced, and it is cute enough. Sure, Potamon may have strange origins, but it is adorable enough to make you overlook them. The same cannot be said for other monsters in the franchise. Guys like Nanimon, Platinum Numemon, and Betsumon are downright unforgivable when it comes to design! And if you have no idea what these guys look like, well - don't say we did not warn you!

7,potatoes,Hasbro provokes backlash after making Mr Potato Head gender neutral,"Hasbro provokes backlash after making Mr Potato Head gender neutral

Toymaker Hasbro sparked an online backlash this week after announcing that it would be dropping the ""Mr"" from its Mr Potato Head toy.

Mr Potato Head is one of the most popular toys to be feature in the hit Toy Story movie franchise from Disney and Pixar.

Notably, his character was known for insisting on the ""Mr"", with ""That's Mr Potato Head to you"" being one of the memorable lines from the movie.

Hasbro announced on Thursday that the toy was being ""reimagined for the modern consumer"" and that ""Mr"" was being removed from packaging from autumn.

It said the new version would give children ""endless"" opportunities to create their own families.

""Hasbro is making sure all feel welcome in the Potato Head world by officially dropping the Mr from the Mr Potato Head brand name and logo to promote gender equality and inclusion,"" it said in a statement.

But the toymaker was mocked online after the announcement.

TalkRADIO's Mark Dolan called Mr Potato Head the ""latest victim of cancel culture"" and of ""woke political correctness gone mad"".

""It is a shocking story, it is a disgrace,"" he said.

""He's a potato! Please leave well alone. Welcome to the crazy world of 2021.""

GMB presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that there were more important things to be getting on with in the middle of a global pandemic than making Mr Potato Head gender-neutral ""in case we upset a few wokies"".

Hasbro has since clarified that Mr and Mrs Potato Head ""aren't going anywhere"" and will still be available to buy.","Hasbro provokes backlash after making Mr Potato Head gender neutralToymaker Hasbro sparked an online backlash this week after announcing that it would be dropping the ""Mr"" from its Mr Potato Head toy.

8,potatoes,Popular D.C. Sweet Potato Cake to Open Bakery in Hyattsville,"A popular bakery that serves a D.C. specialty is opening a location in the Magruder Flat Iron Building in Hyattsville.

Co-owned and run by former Savor Food Hall operator April Richardson, D.C. Sweet Potato Cake will open what she calls a “teeny tiny bakery” the second week of March in the building at 5105 Baltimore Ave.

Several years ago, the company originally had its wholesale operation in Hyattsville, but it grew so rapidly that it moved the wholesale operation to Baltimore. It now provides sweet potato cakes to places such as Starbucks, Safeway and Wegmans.

But due to customer demand, it later opened a small bakery inside the Savor Food Hall in Brentwood until it went under new management.

The sweet potato cake recipe comes from co-owner Derek Lowery’s mother and is made of just flour, sugar, oil, butter, nutmeg and tender sweet potato. The bakery has since put its own spin on it with versions made with Rum, Red Velvet, Chocolate, Butter Pecan and Japanese Maple.

In addition to sweet potato cake, the bakery will also offer sweet potato pie, cheesecakes and homemade layer cakes such as Snickerdoodle, salted caramel, strawberry, coconut pineapple and cookies and cream.

“We are not a custom bakery, we focus on taste and simplicity,” Richardson told the Hyattsville Wire. “We have so many amazing bakeries that surround us that are experts in fondant, breads and wedding cakes so we stay in our lane.”

D.C. Sweet Potato Cake will be open for takeout and delivery with indoor space for up to six people. Richardson said they would also apply for a permit for sidewalk seating.","A popular bakery that serves a D.C. specialty is opening a location in the Magruder Flat Iron Building in Hyattsville.

9,potatoes,Column: Genderless Potato Heads are no cause for panic,"As someone with a three-story pink Barbie Dream House in the middle of her living room, I can tell you that I pay closer attention to gendered children’s toys these days than is normal for a woman my age.

I have noticed, for instance, that the profusion of Barbies sprawled across my floor are not always light-complexioned and blond, with impossibly attenuated torsos, as they were when I was little. My 10-year-old niece’s dolls have a range of skin colors and body sizes; some Barbies, you might even say, are thicc, current slang for a full-figured curvy body. This is a fantastic development, and if I need to explain why, you have not been paying attention.

Now comes the less important but far more hysteria-inducing news that Hasbro’s Mr. Potato Head brand will be dropping the “Mr.” and become simply … Potato Head.

A new toy kit, “Create Your Potato Head Family,” will hit the shelves later this year. It will include, a Hasbro spokeswoman wrote, “enough potatoes and accessories for kids to create all types of families.”

That’s right, folks: Gay potatoes. Transgender potatoes. Cisgender potatoes. Nonbinary potatoes. Whatever kind of spud families kids can imagine. Personal potato pronouns will be interchangeable. If a child wants to call a Potato Head with a mustache and a dress “Miss Thing,” who is to stop him … or her … or them?

This development set off a new wave of gender panic among the right-wing commentariat, self-appointed guardians of sexual standards and gender identity, though some tried to cover their agitation with sophomoric humor.

Gender panic has been described by the sociologist Kristen Schilt of the University of Chicago as a deep, cultural fear that is inflamed when the “naturalness” of a male-female gender binary is challenged. Schilt told UChicago News that when challenges affect public policy, “that’s when the panic starts to get really hot.”

The guardians of traditional morality have decisively lost the battle against same-sex marriage, so now they have had to find other outlets for their anxiety.

Their current hot-button issue (other than genderless Potato Heads) is the fear that individuals born with male genitals will invade spaces reserved for women, places like locker rooms, bathrooms and sports fields.

Anyway, you know the type: People like conservative talk show host Ben Shapiro, who brazenly misgender people like Zoey Tur, the famous Los Angeles helicopter pilot and news reporter, because they are incapable of grasping the scientific truth that gender is fluid, exists on a spectrum and is not necessarily a function of genitalia. Shapiro’s motto, “Facts don’t care about your feelings,” is in fact a refutation of his own position.

And people like QAnon’s own Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who posted a sign outside her Capitol Hill office Thursday announcing, “There are TWO genders: Male & Female. ‘Trust The Science!’” The science, which she would learn if she had an ounce of intellectual curiosity, totally disputes this.

Greene’s office neighbor, Illinois Democrat Marie Newman, who has a transgender daughter, had hung a pink-and-blue transgender pride flag outside her office, an affront to the poisonous Ms. Greene, after Greene tweeted, “Your biological son does NOT belong in my daughters’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.”

Their kerfuffle arose because the House voted Thursday on the long overdue Equality Act, a sweeping law that would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The act, which Greene called “immoral,” passed 224 to 206. Only three Republicans voted in favor.

Keeping Shapiro and Greene company in this basket of anti-trans deplorables is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who launched a bizarre attack against the transgender community on Thursday as he grilled Rachel Levine, President Biden’s nominee for assistant secretary of health.

If Levine, a pediatrician who is Pennsylvania’s top health official, is confirmed, she will become the highest ranking openly transgender federal official in history.

Levine’s very identity seemed to rock Paul, who began his questions by talking about the horrors of female genital mutilation, as if that barbaric practice, which ensures a woman cannot pleasurably engage in sex and has been widely condemned as a human rights violation, has anything to do with hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery.

“We should be outraged that someone’s talking to a 3-year-old about changing their sex!” said Paul, wrongly implying that toddlers whose gender identity does not conform with their physical characteristics are subject to medical interventions. (They are not; though it is not uncommon for transgender children to make social adjustments, such as in their clothing and names.)

Levine refrained from taking his bait: “Transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care that have been developed,” she replied, offering to discuss the subject with Paul at length in his office.

Ungendering the Potato Head family may be only a minor step toward embracing the notion that heterosexuality is only one component of the human sexual kaleidoscope and gender can be more than the sum of the parts a person is born with. But Hasbro’s action is important. The games we play as children teach us not just what the world is, but what it can be. A potato, it turns out, is not always just a potato.

11,potatoes,Masala roasties and onion tart: Nik Sharma's potato recipes,"My oven is like a piano that’s played every day, and I use it partly for the heat it emanates, but also for the ease – pop something in and forget all about it until the timer rings. Right now, I’m craving the comforting texture of potatoes and the warm perfume of spices, and both of today’s recipes, which carry strong influences from southern India, sing to the tune of the oven. In the first, the spicy fragrance of sambar masala – the spice blend used to make sambar, a lentil and vegetable stew – enlivens a mixture of roast potatoes, fennel, and beans, while the second is a simple yet delightful warm potato and onion tart paired with curry leaves, the crunchy, nutty texture of mustard seeds, creamy, salty feta and a soothing herb chutney.

Potato and onion tart with mint chutney (pictured above)

Prep 30 min

Cook 45 min

Serves 4-6

For the tart

1 x 640g sheet frozen puff pastry, defrosted

2 medium baking potatoes (about 180g each), peeled

1 large red onion (about 300g), peeled

10 curry leaves

1 garlic clove, peeled and grated

2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

1 tsp red pepper flakes

1 tsp black or brown mustard seeds

½ tsp fine sea salt

½ tsp ground black pepper

30g feta, crumbled (optional)

For the chutney

1 x 20g bunch fresh coriander, leaves and stems

1 x 12g bunch fresh mint, leaves and stems

1 green chilli pepper (such as serrano)

10 black peppercorns

2 tbsp lime juice

1 pinch sugar

Fine sea salt

Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Line a 23cm x 30cm rimmed baking tray with tin foil. Unroll the pastry and place it on the tray. Fold each side of the pastry to form a 1cm border, then, using the prongs of a fork, press the border down to form an impression. Prick the centre of the pastry all over, to help it rise evenly during baking.

Cut the potatoes into thin circles and place them in a bowl. Cut the onion in half lengthways, then cut each half into thin sections. Add the onions, curry leaves and garlic to the potatoes, drizzle with the oil, then scatter over the red pepper flakes, mustard seeds, salt and black pepper. Toss gently, to avoid breaking the potato slices, until everything is well coated, then spread the mixture over the surface of the pastry, avoiding the border.

Bake for about 45 minutes, rotating once halfway through to ensure even cooking, until puffed up and golden brown all over. Remove and sprinkle over the feta, if using.

While the tart is baking, make the chutney. Put the coriander, mint, green chilli, peppercorns, lime juice, sugar and two tablespoons of cold water in a blender and blitz smooth; if it’s still a little thick for your liking, add up to a tablespoon more water to loosen. Season to taste with salt, then serve on the side of the warm tart.

Sambar masala-spiced roast potatoes with fennel and white beans

Nik Sharma’s oven roasted potatoes, fennel, and white beans with sambar masala

Prep 30 min

Cook 50 min

Serves 4

4 medium baking potatoes (about 180g each; I used russets), peeled

1 x 400g can white beans, drained and rinsed

1 large white or yellow onion (300g), peeled

2 fennel bulbs (about 230g each), trimmed

2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

1½ tbsp sambar masala, store-bought or homemade (see recipe below)

12 curry leaves (optional)

1 tsp red chilli flakes

Fine sea salt and pepper, to taste

2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, plus the zest of 1 lemon

2 spring onions, both white and green parts, thinly sliced

2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves

For the sambar masala (makes about 200g)

15g large fresh curry leaves (about 40 in total)

40g whole dried red chillies (or about 12 – I use equal parts whole kashmiri and byadgi chillies, but if you want it hotter, use cayenne)

50g dried yellow split peas (AKA chana dal)

3 tbsp coriander seeds

2 tbsp black or brown mustard seeds

1 ½ tbsp fenugreek seeds

1 tbsp cumin seeds

5cm piece cinnamon stick

1 tsp ground turmeric

2 tsp sesame oil, or a neutral oil such as grapeseed

If you’re making your own sambar masala, heat a dry skillet or cast-iron pan over a medium-low heat, add all the dry ingredients, drizzle in the oil and cook the spices carefully, stirring constantly, for three to four minutes – they will turn fragrant and begin to toast, and the masala is ready when the split peas start to turn brown, the curry leaves go crisp and the spices sizzle and pop. Take off the heat, tip the spice mixture on to a plate to cool completely to room temperature, then transfer to a spice grinder or coffee mill and blitz to a fine powder. Store in an airtight container and keep in a cool, dry and dark spot for up to four months.

Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Dice the potatoes into 2½cm chunks, place in a large roasting pan and add the drained beans.

12,potatoes,"Here’s a half-baked PC question: Why are Mr. Potato, et al, all white potatoes?","Ah, for the good old days when people used to squabble in jest.

“You say potato, I say pot-ah-to.”

Those were part of the lyrics to the aptly named song “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” that could serve as a light hearted official ditty for today’s cancel culture flash mobs brought to you by the shallow thinking world created by communicating in 144 characters.

For those unfamiliar with the song, it is about a couple lamenting how their romance has gone flat by pointing out how they pronounce words differently.

At one point they conclude “it looks like we two will never be one” and that “something must be done” so they opt to “call the whole thing off.’

Before we go on with the song, I’d better make some disclaimers before I open myself to being swept into the mass grave for not being politically correct that those committed to playing cultural genocide are eager to fill by reprising the role of Mao’s youthful Red Guard.

I’m afraid the song was sung for the most part by those of the opposite sex defined narrowly as male and female as opposed to the 50 plus ways Facebook encourages one to check to describe their gender.

I admit that the song is not inclusive of those who are asexual. Nor does it necessarily celebrate those that identify as binary. I apologize profusely if referencing the song makes me a gender bigot.

And yes, I am at great risk of offending someone, I’m sure, because the song was written by George Gershwin. He is a man who screams political incorrectness for not just being a man and one that is Caucasian but by simply not being a part of the current century and failing to fill his portion of the Great American Songbook with underrepresented cultures.

Since I haven’t checked on the latest decrees of the self-righteous keepers of the cancel culture channeling Salem circa 1692, I’m not too sure it is OK to reference Gershwin. Rest assured I’m sure there is some lyric that he wrote, some comment he uttered, something that he did that would earn the wrath of those who grasp smartphones more than they ever shake hands.

Why be friendly with someone who doesn’t fit perfectly in your view of the world when you can dismiss and damn them by tapping your indignation out to the world two seconds after you encounter them?

I really wish I am digressing.

Unfortunately I’m not. The premise of the 1937 song was the pretense to a falling out that ultimately did not happen in the movie “Shall We Dance”. Fred Astaire, by the way, played an American ballet dancer who falls madly in love with a famous tap dancer by Ginger Rogers. In today’s woke world Astaire would run the risk of being accused of misappropriating the role of a male ballet dancer in some corners of today’s society.

The plot brought two practitioners of wildly different dance — classic ballet and modern jazz dancing— together. They did so by ultimately celebrating their differences once they stopped trying to “cancel” the other’s passions and differences out.

The desire to level the playing field as well as not make people suffer any affront, imagined or otherwise, to their sensibilities isn’t about bringing people together. It’s about pounding them into submission.

It has led us to see things that aren’t there. And the self-righteous zeal will end up doing the same thing that people did to the modern equivalent of politically incorrect people back in 1692 during the Salem Witch Trials or in China where upwards of 20 million people were literally cancelled for being culturally incorrect.

This leads to half-baked crusades and pre-emptive self-immolation on the pyre of political correctness.

Hasbro is the latest example.

Dropping the mister is supposed to make the Potato Head inclusive for kids.

Have you taken a look at a Mr. Potato Head? The same shaped potato is used for Mrs. Potato Head or is that Miss Potato Head or Ms. Potato Head?

Most kids — including back in the Stone Age when I had a hand-me-down Mr. Potato Head — aren’t thinking about gender roles. They are thinking about having fun. And usually that means mixing up female and male features to be silly.

That’s why Hasbro has it all wrong. Mr. Potato Head may have been the first transgender toy. And it’s not because it was marketed and packaged that way, but because kids created a transgender potato on their own.

This sounds silly, doesn’t it? That said it is no more silly than what Hasbro is doing.

And since they opened the door, let’s talk what’s really wrong with Mr. Potato Head and the politically incorrect folks at Hasbro foisting their views of potatoes on young minds.

You ever notice Mr. Potato et al are all “white” potatoes?

Why isn’t Hasbro celebrating red potatoes, Yukon gold potatoes, or sweet potatoes? Talk about white privilege.

There are some series discrimination questions here. How does Hasbro expect anyone to accept red potatoes when they cater to the white potato that dominates everything from the deep fryers at fast food joints to the deli section?

And why is Hasbro forcing potatoes to comply with their view of the world?

Everyone knows potatoes have eyes all over the place and not in the same general area as Homo sapiens. Yet Hasbro persists in marketing, movies, and packaging to depict Mr. Potato Head as if the only eye placement that is acceptable is that of a human and not a potato.

It’s pure unadulterated body shaming. Hasbro should be celebrating potatoes instead of enslaving them and forcing them to fit into the Eurocentric view of the world.

Worst yet, Hasbro is probably responsible for the marginalization of real potatoes. Ever notice how people in grocery stores will rummage through potatoes and toss those aside that have eyes protruding, have a less than perfect shape, are splattered with black marks and have a slight smell? It’s clearly from subtle indoctrination people got as a kid playing with Mr. Potato Head.

Hasbro is guilty of giving potatoes the “Barbie and Ken” treatment over the decades instead of making Mr. Potato Heads that look like imperfect potatoes.

Perhaps it is time to update “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off.”

How about “you say potato, I say a sexist, body shaming, white male spud.”

13,potatoes,Farm invests £263k in search of hi-tech potato perfection,"Bruce van Poortvliet inside the new £263,000 potato store at Poortvliet Farms near Aylsham - Credit: Poortvliet Farms

A Norfolk farm has invested £263,000 in a hi-tech new storage building to keep its potatoes in perfect market condition for longer after harvest.

The new store at Poortvliet Farms, near Aylsham, can hold 1,300 tonnes of potatoes in an atmospherically-controlled environment.

Ventilation, refrigeration and humidification equipment is automated via electronic sensors which report on air quality, temperature, carbon dioxide levels and humidity inside the insulated building.

This allows the farm's potatoes to be stored in top condition until the end of the marketing season in June and July - enabling premium prices to be obtained as there is a critical shortage of UK potatoes available in those summer months before the next season's crop is harvested.

Farmer Bruce van Poortvliet said the ability to accurately control storage conditions was increasingly important following the EU ban on chlorpropham (CIPC), previously used as a sprout suppressant for potato growers.

""The new potato store will enable us to sell all or part of the crop later in the season when it can attract a higher price,"" he said. ""Only modern stores allow this to be done consistently and reliably.

""The banning of CIPC sprout suppressant means there are challenges for the potato market, so we are pleased to be investing in a new, modern store.""

A new grader and small-scale bagging line have also been installed. The grader will ensure the crop is fit for both storage and eventual sale to packers. It will also be used prior to bagging potatoes into retail and commercial packs for sale direct to local pubs, restaurants and shops.

The project secured a grant of £65,903 from the Eastern Agri-Tech Growth Initiative, towards total projects costs of £263,613.

The initiative is run by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority with support from New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, Norfolk County Council, Cambridgeshire County Council, and other local authorities.

14,potatoes,3 viral TikTok recipes worth the hype,"Childhood bak kwa sandwiches enter the TikTok era with my Chinese New Year spin on the tortilla wrap hack.

Essentially, it is just another use of the wrap - with a simple yet smart way of enveloping ingredients.

After looking through various spins on this wrap phenomenon, I decide that mine will serve a higher purpose - help me clear my leftover bak kwa stash.

Quarter the square pieces or use the coin-shaped ones. If you are taking bak kwa out from the fridge or freezer, be sure to heat it up first in the microwave to soften the meat.

The lettuce cuts through the salt and oil from the bak kwa, while mozzarella gives a lovely melty cheese pull. Adding an omelette to the mix makes this a jazzed-up breakfast wrap - definitely several notches up from my school lunch box of yesteryear.

INGREDIENTS

1 egg

A dash of salt and white pepper

2 tbsp oil

1 tortilla wrap

2 butterhead lettuce leaves, shredded

1 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise

1 slice of bak kwa, quartered, or 4 pieces of coin-shaped bak kwa

10 to 20g shredded mozzarella

METHOD

1. To make the omelette, crack an egg into a small bowl and scramble with a fork. Beat in salt and white pepper.

2. Heat a flat non-stick pan on medium heat and add the oil.

3. Pour the egg into the pan and leave to cook for a few minutes until the base has set.

4. With a spatula, fold the egg over in half. Then fold it over again into a quarter. Remove from heat and set aside on a plate.

5. To assemble the wrap, place a tortilla wrap on a cutting board. With a knife, make a cut from the middle of wrap straight down to the edge.

6. Place a different ingredient in each quadrant of the wrap. Start with the shredded lettuce in the bottom left quadrant and squeeze the Kewpie mayonnaise on top.

7. Move clockwise upwards to the top left quadrant. Place your bak kwa in this quadrant, followed by the omelette in the top right quadrant.

8. Finally in the last quadrant (bottom right), place your shredded mozzarella cheese.

9. Fold the wrap up, starting clockwise from the bottom left quadrant. Fold it up and over the top left quadrant. Then, fold it over to the top right quadrant. Finally, fold it down to the bottom right.","Childhood bak kwa sandwiches enter the TikTok era with my Chinese New Year spin on the tortilla wrap hack.

16,potatoes,The iconic Mr. Potato Head is going gender neutral,"How often do you pick up a potato and assume its gender? Yam I right?

Boy? Girl?

“It’s a potato,” said Ali Mierzejewski, editor-in-chief at toy review site The Toy Insider about the popular Hasbro toy, Mr. Potato Head.

For Hasbro’s hottest potato toy that’s not necessarily the case.

Now, Hasbro said it will release a new Potato Head playset in the fall that won’t subscribe to any prefix.

The new playset transforms the 70-year old Mr. Potato Head into an all-inclusive potato – released of its binary gender roles.

The change comes amid criticism over the lack of inclusivity against the toy industry and other mainstream products.

This past month, Quaker Oats released a new name and logo for its “Aunt Jemima” products, retiring the racist stereotype that defined the brand for years.

Aunt Jemima has a new name: the Pearl Milling Company. Quaker Oats announced it would drop the name Aunt Jemima last summer after the killing of George Floyd and the widespread protests over racial inequality. https://t.co/RlgO9OrRSP — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 10, 2021

Mattel, the company who introduced the world to Barbie, was criticized for its unrealistic beauty standards and a lack of diversity for years.

Last year, Barbie unveiled a launch of diverse dolls some of which had vitiligo and prosthetics.

The company promoted the line in a tweet saying, “More skin tones, More body types, More unique looks!”

Hasbro appears to be going in a more inclusive direction for kids.

But for those fans of the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head brand, Hasbro said it will continue to make the popular toys as well.

17,potatoes,Hasbro's Mr. Potato Head Is Now Gender-Neutral,"According to reports, Hasbro has now rebranded Mr. Potato Head as gender-neutral. Taking to Twitter, the toy purveyor tweeted a photo showing new boxes set to roll out later this year accompanied by a playful yet poignant message.

“Hold that Tot – your main spud, MR. POTATO HEAD isn’t going anywhere! While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name & logo are dropping the ‘MR.’ I yam proud to confirm that MR. & MRS. POTATO HEAD aren’t going anywhere and will remain MR. & MRS. POTATO HEAD.”

The root vegetable-inspired figure made popular in the Toy Story franchise is now the latest toy to be updated for inclusivity and diversity. Potato Head will now allow kids more accurately express figures that represent their own family model. Rich Ferraro, Chief Communications Officer of LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, praised the decision to rebrand, “Hasbro is helping kids to simply see toys as toys, which encourages them to be their authentic selves outside of the pressures of traditional gender norms.

Introduced back in 1952, Potato Head began as a set of pronged body and face parts that were made to fit into fruits and vegetables to create a “funny face man.” The now-familiar plastic potato shape was only introduced in the ’60s after children choked on the small pieces and cut themselves on the sharp end of the body and face parts.
