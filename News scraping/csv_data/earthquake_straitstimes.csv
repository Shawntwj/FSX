11,First islandwide survey to uncover what lies beneath Singapore and its earthquake risk,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/first-islandwide-survey-to-uncover-what-lies-beneath-singapore-and-its,"SINGAPORE - For the first time, an islandwide geophysical survey has been conducted to uncover what lies beneath Singapore.
Conducted in 2019 by a team of researchers from the Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), the survey's aim was to help researchers understand underground structures and uncover the risk of earthquakes that the country may face.
A total of 88 seismometers were deployed across the island, including in schools, parks, nature reserves and weather stations, to detect seismic events and background noise.
For instance, the researchers were able to detect a ""reasonably small"" earthquake about 100km north of Singapore.
There are no records of earthquakes occurring in Singapore, though the Republic has periodically experienced low-level earth tremors caused by earthquakes in Sumatra, Indonesia, said Dr Lythgoe.","uncover, lies, dr, earthquakes, survey, researchers, understand, islandwide, risk, beneath, earthquake, underground, seismic, detect, singapore, rock"

The researchers monitored African elephants in Kenya by listening for their vocalised rumbles using microphones and seismometers - often used for measuring earthquakes and explosions.
There are two main theories for how the elephants are able to hear these low frequency sounds.
They may detect the sound waves using sensors in the skin of their feet, or through bone conduction - meaning the wave travels up through their legs and to the middle ear.

The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) were on track for 25.5 per cent of the vote, ahead of 24.5 per cent for Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc, projections for broadcaster ARD showed, but both groups believed they could lead the next government.
The tight result, which saw the CDU/CSU slump to a post-war low for a federal election, means lengthy coalition talks will follow before a new government takes office, likely involving the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP).

The USDA in July reported the Dominican Republic had the Americas' first cases of African swine fever in nearly 40 years.
African swine fever is harmless to humans but often fatal to pigs.

259,India closer to building world's biggest nuclear plant,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/india-closer-to-building-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant,"PARIS (AFP) - French energy group EDF on Friday (April 23) took a key step towards helping to build the world's biggest nuclear power plant in India, a project blocked for years by nuclear events and local opposition.
EDF, which is in exclusive talks with Indian officials, would not build the power plant itself, but would provide the nuclear reactors in a deal that includes US partner GE Steam Power.
The state-owned PSU Nuclear Power Corporation of India controls the national nuclear energy sector, and the EDF offer was submitted to the country's nuclear operator NPCIL.
India already has several agreements for the exchange of nuclear technologies and expertise with countries like the United States, France, Russia and Japan.
At present, there are 22 functioning nuclear reactors in India, most of them pressurised heavy water reactors, providing about 3 per cent of the country's power.","build, local, nuclear, edf, provide, closer, worlds, building, biggest, plant, india, power, project, reactors"
