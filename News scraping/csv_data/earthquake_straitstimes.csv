0,02/2022,PORT,$806 million pledged for Haiti earthquake relief,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/806-million-pledged-for-haiti-earthquake-relief,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (AFP) - The international community pledged US$600 million (S$806.28 million) on Wednesday (Feb 16) to help rebuild Haiti's devastated south, where an earthquake killed more than 2,200 people six months ago.
""These contributions went well above our expectations,"" said Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, after the conclusion of an international summit in Port-au-Prince.

144,06/2020,"LA CRUCECITA, MEXICO (REUTERS) – A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck southern Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday (June 24), killing at least six people and cutting off isolated villages, as well as causing damage to buildings hundreds of kilometres away in Mexico City.

The fatalities were near the quake’s centre in Oaxaca, a mountainous state known for its coffee, mescal and Spanish colonial architecture.

A Reuters witness in the tourist town of La Crucecita, which Mexican authorities said was the epicentre of the earthquake, saw anxious residents standing outside their homes on the streets many hours after the tremor as they feared deadly aftershocks.

Many houses were scarred by huge cracks across walls and residents sought to clear debris from the streets, the Reuters witness added.

About 200 houses in the area were damaged, including 30 that were badly impacted, a local official said.

“We lost everything in one moment to nature,” said Vicente Romero, an owner of a stationery store whose house suffered vast structural damage. “This is our life’s work.”

Rockfalls blocked the winding mountain roads between the state capital of Oaxaca city and the coast.

Rescue workers have not reached all villages reported to have suffered damage, raising fears that more people may be injured or killed.

A Oaxaca state official said rescue workers were trying to get to the settlement of Santa Catarina Xanaguia, near the epicentre, where the quake brought down homes or parts of the mountainside, trapping people.

People had sent messages for help by phone, the official added. A clinic and old churches in hill villages near the epicenter were severely damaged, images on social media showed.

The dead included a worker from state oil company Pemex, who fell from a height. Pemex was forced to briefly shutter the country’s biggest oil refinery in Oaxaca.

Miguel Candelaria, 30, was working at his computer in his family home in the Oaxaca town of Juchitan when the ground began to tremble.

He ran outside with relatives, but they had to stop in the middle of the street as the pavement buckled and rocked.

159,07/2020,"Hidden in the genes of seaweed may be evidence of the planet's past geological violence.

Researchers say that the genes of bull kelp along the shore of New Zealand's South Island bear marks of an earthquake that occurred 800 years ago, when part of the ocean floor rose upward and wiped out its inhabitants.

That made way for newcomers of a different genetic background, the ancestors of today's kelp. The finding suggests that moments of cataclysmic change in an environment can be revealed by comparing genes across populations of some organisms.

New Zealand lies atop a nest of fault lines. After a quake four years ago, the edge of a fault near the town of Kaikoura shot more than 1.8m out of the water, and zoology professor Jon Waters at University of Otago, and his colleagues, began to wonder what happened to kelp after such destruction.

Those stranded above the high tide line die swiftly, but as the ecosystem below the water shifts into a new normal, there is suddenly a lot of free real estate, where new individuals can sweep in and take over. And because of the way that a population of kelp carpets an area for the long term and makes little room for new arrivals, Professor Waters said, the algae provided an ideal test bed for seeing whether a disaster's effects on the gene pool persist over time.

The scientists took samples of kelp along a 97km stretch of the coastline near Dunedin, where a similar quake happened about 800 years ago. Individual kelp looked much the same but when the scientists examined the genetics, there were large differences linked to where the kelp had been collected.
