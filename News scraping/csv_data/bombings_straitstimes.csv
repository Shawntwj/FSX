The 177-year-old tower has been swathed in scaffolding for the past three years as craftsmen refurbish its stonework and famous 12 tonne clock.
Mr Ian Ailles, director-general of the House of Commons, said the task of restoring the tower had been more complex than anticipated.
Among other problems, bomb damage inflicted on the tower during the World War II had been found to be more extensive than first thought.
Although the tower survived Nazi bombing, its roof and dials were damaged in a May 1941 air raid which destroyed the main House of Commons chamber.","war, damage, commons, scaffolding, damaged, tower, world, tonne, bombs, thought, clock, britains, structure, big, originally, house, ben, nazi, badly",Conflict/Terrorist activities

The Afghan arm of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack, which was committed by an assailant on foot, said a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province.

There was at least one child among the fatalities, while three other minors were wounded.

Last month, three blasts in rapid succession in the centre of Jalalabad left three people dead and 20 wounded.

The area around Jalalabad is home to fighters from both the Taleban and the ISIS group's Afghan affiliate.

Afghan government and United States military officials have said they will step up air strikes and operations to eliminate the militants, who first emerged in Nangarhar in 2015.

Until then, this city near the border with Pakistan had largely been spared from attacks and fighting.

However, in March, at least 16 civilians were killed in a suicide bombing followed by gunfire targeting a construction company near the city's airport. The Taleban said it was not behind that attack.

354,04/2019,"The precise relationship between Zahran and ISIS is not yet known. An official with India's security services, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that during a raid on a suspected ISIS cell by the National Investigation Agency earlier this year officers found copies of Zahran's videos. The operation was in the state of Tamil Nadu, just across a thin strait of ocean from Sri Lanka.

'LIKE A SPOILED CHILD'

Back in 2005, Zahran was looking to make his way in the world. His hometown of Kattankudy is some seven hours' drive from Colombo on the other side of the island nation, past the countless palm trees, roadside Buddha statues, cashew hawkers and an occasional lumbering elephant in the bush. It is a town of about 40,000 people, a dot on the eastern coast with no clear future for an impoverished young man who'd just been expelled.

Zahran joined a mosque in 2006, the Dharul Athar, and gained a place on its management committee. But within three years they'd had a falling out.

""He wanted to speak more independently, without taking advice from elders,"" said the mosque's imam, or spiritual leader, MTM Fawaz.

Also, the young man was more conservative, Fawaz said, objecting, for instance, to women wearing bangles or earrings.

""The rest of us come together as community leaders, but Zahran wanted to speak for himself,"" said Fawaz, a man with broad shoulders lounging with a group of friends in a back office of the mosque after evening prayers. ""He was a black sheep who broke free.""

Mohamed Yusuf Mohamed Thaufeek, a friend who met Zahran at school and later became an adherent of his, said the problems revolved around Zahran's habit of misquoting Islamic scriptures.

The mosque's committee banned him from preaching for three months in 2009. Zahran stormed off.

""We treated him like a spoiled child, a very narrow",Suspected mastermind behind Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday bombs was a 'black sheep' troublemaker,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/suspected-mastermind-behind-sri-lankas-easter-sunday-bombs-was-a-black-sheep,"The operation was in the state of Tamil Nadu, just across a thin strait of ocean from Sri Lanka.
Zahran joined a mosque in 2006, the Dharul Athar, and gained a place on its management committee.
In 2004, there was a grenade attack on a Sufi mosque and in 2006 several homes of Sufis were set afire.
That December, the mosque Zahran founded released a public notice disowning him.

Mr Goldberg has served since 2019 as ambassador to Colombia and previously as charge d'affaires in Cuba and ambassador to the Philippines and Bolivia, among other postings.
He also worked as coordinator for the implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear weapons and missile programs from 2009 to 2010.
The post in one of the United States' key allies has been filled by a charge d'affaires for more than a year since the last ambassador to South Korea, former navy Admiral Harry Harris, stepped down when Mr Biden took office in January 2021.
While Seoul and Washington insist their alliance is ""iron-clad"", the sanctions have been a source of controversy as they blocked South Korean President Moon Jae-in's desire for more economic engagement with North Korea.","south, tests, ambassador, picks, mr, enforcer, korea, biden, missile, washington, sanctions, nuclear, north",Conflict/Terrorist activities

You can use the free Greg plant care mobile app, available on the Apple App Store, to take the guesswork out of gardening.

The app uses machine learning to help its users care for plants. It first zeroes in on the plant owner's location and then asks for photos of the items to be cared for. Greg identifies the type of plant, then advises about watering and calculates whether the plant is getting enough sunlight through proximity to a window.

The app is connected to a global community of plant owners who help contribute to its effectiveness by giving regular feedback about their plants through the app. The more feedback the app gets, the smarter its artificial intelligence becomes.

This data helps the team behind Greg identify how more than 5,000 plant species respond to various temperatures, light conditions, latitudes and longitudes and watering schedules.

Gregarious Laboratories, which created Greg, was set up in New York by former employees of Tinder, the American networking and online dating app.

The app was created to promote a better understanding of plant engineering and to create a greener, healthier planet. It is available free as well as with a range of options for paid subscriptions.

As well as the four prisoners, the raid yielded quantities of weapons and documents, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter.
The return of ISIS' local affiliate, just as the new government is grappling with a potentially catastrophic economic crisis, has added to the mounting array of problems facing the Taliban.

521,02/2021,MOGADISHU (REUTERS) ,Nine killed in hotel attack in Somali capital: Police,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/militants-storm-hotel-in-somali-capital-just-ahead-of-crucial-election,"MOGADISHU (REUTERS) - Nine people died after al Qaeda-linked Islamist insurgents stormed a hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu, battling security forces until the early hours of Monday (Feb 1), a police spokesman said.
A suicide car bombing on Sunday evening was followed by a shootout between al Shabaab militants and security forces at the Hotel Afrik.
The attack on a hotel in the heart of the heavily fortified city comes as Somali politicians wrangle acrimoniously over delayed elections and follows the withdrawal of around 700 US military personnel last month.
The US troops were largely supporting Somali special forces known as Danaab who are skilled at complex operations against high level al Shabaab targets.
They also enjoyed considerable support from the Americans, including air support and medical evacuations, and some Somali politicians have raised fears the pullout ordered by US President Donald Trump could weaken the fight against al Shabab.","president, forces, attack, killed, al, shabaab, security, politicians, mogadishu, hotel, capital, somali, support",Conflict/Terrorist activities
