Figures from the Ministry of Manpower showed that the resident unemployment rate, which covers Singapore citizens and permanent residents, rose from 3.5 to 3.7 per cent, while unemployment among Singapore citizens rose from 3.7 to 3.9 per cent.
The overall unemployment rate in July was 2.8 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in June.
Said Mr Tan: ""We will continue to monitor the unemployment rates closely.
Analysts feel that the slight bump in the unemployment rate due to temporary measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 under phase two (heightened alert) was expected.","rates, unemployment, manpower, measures, covid19, months, singapore, sectors, singapores, tan, phase, rate, 02",Severe weather disruptions

2,06/2021,SPIELBERG (AFP) ,Motor racing: Verstappen ready to pounce as cracks widen in Mercedes armour,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/formula-one/motor-racing-verstappen-ready-to-pounce-as-cracks-widen-in-mercedes-armour,"SPIELBERG (AFP) - Max Verstappen will seek to extend his lead over Lewis Hamilton in the world championship at Sunday's (June 27) Styrian Grand Prix as the cracks in Mercedes' armoury widen.
Last year, when the sweeping circuit in the Styrian Alps also hosted two successive season-opening events, Mercedes won both with Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas claiming one apiece.
However, Verstappen won in 2018 and 2019 and he has been the dominant force since Hamilton's last win in early May.
If he can triumph again in the Styrian race, he will be well-placed for a repeat seven days later in the Austrian Grand Prix and might then have a comfortable cushion in points advantage before Hamilton's home British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July.
His erstwhile Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg won the 2016 title, when Hamilton went five without a win.","won, pounce, cracks, mercedes, styrian, win, armour, racing, verstappen, motor, grand, prix, hamilton, team, ready, widen, sundays",Severe weather disruptions

The biggest headache for the ECB is the apparent disconnect between inflation and growth.
Having bought trillions of euros worth of government and corporate debt for years, the ECB has rekindle growth and the euro zone is creating jobs faster than expected.
But wage growth remains anaemic, keeping a lid on inflation, which is likely to undershoot the ECB's target of almost 2 per cent at least through 2019, suggesting that easy monetary policy will have to continue for years to come.","inflation, better, ecb, mr, likely, despite, euros, sticks, monetary, money, euro, easy, pledge, kept, central, european, policy, bank, growth",Severe weather disruptions
81,06/2017,"Craftsmen like Mr Wu Yuanxin, who specialises in a traditional printing and dyeing style known as Nantong blue calico, is the type of talent the authorities would like more of.

In the past three years, Mr Wu has developed more than 1,000 products including wall hangings, bags, scarves and ties, shoes and toys made with Nantong blue calico, he told a forum organised by People's Daily last week.

""The developing and preservation of traditional crafts should not be just focused on their historical value and craftsmanship,"" the People's Daily online quoted him as saying.

Mr Wu added: ""Through innovative designs, we could combine traditional crafts with fashion, making them more accessible to everyone.

""Without demand, or the market, any talk of developing and preserving traditional crafts is just empty words.""

Last year, a documentary on museum craftsmen restoring relics became a surprise online hit, with most of the viewers being youngsters born in the 1990s and 2000s.
Mr Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum, told Xinhua news agency earlier this year that the documentary's popularity had sparked a surge of interest in conservation craftsmanship.
In order for craftsmanship to survive and thrive, skills have to be passed to the next generation, he said.
The Palace Museum could consider recruiting people with lower paper qualifications, such as high school or vocational institute graduates, said Mr Huang.","traditional, woodwork, craftsmanship, mr, china, huang, palace, workers, museum, wu, craftsmen, revival",Severe weather disruptions

83,02/2017,"LONDON • Eddie Jones sold Wales a dummy over the Principality Stadium roof by insisting on Thursday that it must be open when they meet in the Six Nations Championship today.

The England head coach had maintained an air of indifference over the roof all week, claiming that he did not particularly care whether it was open but that he welcomed the hostile atmosphere that is enhanced by closing it.

""The louder it is, the better it is,"" he had said.

That led Wales to believe that they could close the roof for the game. The Welsh had always wanted to play indoors and asked Six Nations officials before the tournament began if the rules could be changed and brought into line with the World Cup, where the default position is for all retractable roofs to be closed. However, that request was rejected and Six Nations regulations require both teams to agree on closing the roof, with Wales to be informed of the decision at least 48 hours before the match.

Jones, having lured Wales into thinking the game would be played in the conditions they favour, changed tack and announced shortly before the deadline that England wanted the roof to remain open.

""It's not my decision to make whether it increases the atmosphere or not. I'm not an entertainer, I'm a coach,"" he said. ""The decision (was) made on what I think is the best thing for the team to win.""

The move will be welcomed by rugby traditionalists who have long insisted that adapting to potentially adverse weather conditions is one of the key aspects of the game.
