The pipeline, owned by Star Petroleum Refining Public Company (SPRC), sprang a leak on Jan 26 and spewed an estimated 47,100l to 55,000l of oil into the sea.
It was patched up within a day but not before it damaged a beach area in Rayong province and threatened corals in the shallow waters.
Deputy governor of Rayong province, Pirun Hemmarak, said the latest spill was unlikely to reach the shoreline under current tide conditions.
The spill comes as Thailand sees a steady increase in visitors following the recent easing of its tight entry restrictions and quarantine.","province, oil, contain, east, rayong, pipeline, spill, eastern, scrambles, second, coast, damaged, thailand, leak",Man-Made Disaster
1,01/2022,BANGKOK (REUTERS) ,Oil spill threatens corals in eastern Thailand,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/oil-spill-threatens-corals-in-eastern-thailand,"BANGKOK (REUTERS) - The authorities are rushing to prevent an oil spill in eastern Thailand from damaging fragile corals, after officials said on Sunday (Jan 30) the leak that began last week is drifting towards more coastal areas.
""If the oil reached inside this area, it could impact the beach and cause heavy damage to the shallow water corals,"" Mr Varawut said.
The oil began leaking from a pipeline owned by Star Petroleum Refining Public Company (SPRC) late on Tuesday.
Before it was brought under control, an estimated 50,000 litres of oil escaped into the ocean 20km from the coastline of eastern Thailand.
The latest satellite image from the government's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) showed the oil spill has spread to cover a sea area of 67 sq km.","varawut, beach, oil, late, area, eastern, spill, corals, prevent, began, thailand, threatens",Man-Made Disaster

The environmental disaster is unfolding far to the north around the Arctic Circle, in the marshy wilderness near the isolated mining town of Norilsk.

Diesel fuel spilled from a tank that ruptured last week after settling into permafrost that had stood firm for years but gave way during a warm spring, Russian officials said.

The accident, which environmental groups have compared to the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in Alaska in 1989, has highlighted the risks of industrial development in the thawing Arctic, where climate change is warming the environment at a rate about twice as fast as the rest of the planet.

The spill released about 150,000 barrels of diesel into a river, compared with about 260,000 barrels of crude oil released into Prince William Sound during the Exxon accident, a touchstone for environmental damage from such spills.

The diesel has been seeping into the marshy riverbanks and spreading as an iridescent sheen on the surface of rivers.

A frantic effort to lay booms, or floating barriers, across the rivers has not contained the spill.

Parts of the once-thriving ecosystem in Nigeria's oil-rich delta have been transformed into an ecological dead zone because of oil bunkering - the practice of siphoning oil from pipelines.
Oil pirates puncture holes in pipelines, steal the crude oil, and then transport it to be sold on the black market or to be refined.
Both the theft and refining process leave behind oil spills that cause severe environmental damage to the delta, turning it into a scorched earth of oil slicks, polluted waters and sparse vegetation.

Apocalyptic images on television and social media showed walls of flame lighting up the night, buildings ablaze, and clouds of smoke billowing across hillsides during the day in Gangwon province.

The fire broke out late on Thursday alongside a road in the mountainous county of Goseong, about 160km north",National disaster declared as South Korea fights forest fire,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/national-disaster-declared-as-s-korea-fights-forest-fire,"SEOUL • A giant forest fire has swept across swathes of South Korea, as the authorities declared a rare national disaster, deploying some 900 fire engines and tens of thousands of personnel to bring it under control.
Fanned by strong winds, the blaze incinerated at least 400 homes and some 500ha of land, according to the government.
Among the damaged buildings are nursing facilities and commercial camping sites - the eastern coastal cities are popular resort destinations.
The central government yesterday morning declared a state of national disaster, entitling affected areas to special assistance, including goods and equipment, and banning entry to dangerous zones.
South Korea declared states of disaster in 2005 in the wake of a massive wildfire in Yangyang in the same province, and in 2007 after South Korea's worst oil spill from a tanker off the western coast of Taean, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.","koreas, authorities, forest, disaster, national, zones, declared, south, fights, korea, buildings, seoul",Man-Made Disaster

""Climate change is bringing new and wicked problems,"" he said in Parliament.
""It is no coincidence that we are building more desalination and Newater plants - we need to produce water almost at will, regardless of whether the rains come.""
In terms of food, this means decreasing the dependence on the global food market, which accounts for over 90 per cent of Singapore's current food supply.","water, newater, global, 30, food, parliament, ensure, singapores, survival, change, resources, countrys, cent, decades, face, masagos, push, grow",Man-Made Disaster
