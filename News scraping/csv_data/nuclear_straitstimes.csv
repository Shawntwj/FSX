Diana Toebbe, 46, admitted taking part in her husband Jonathan Toebbe's plan to sell information on US nuclear submarines to an unidentified foreign buyer.
But last week Jonathan Toebbe, 43, pleaded guilty to the same charge, and in doing so admitted his wife took part in the plot.
Jonathan Toebbe was a nuclear engineer for the US Navy dealing with nuclear submarine propulsion systems when the two were arrested on October 9, 2021 after he hid a small SD card carrying US secrets at a dead drop location in West Virginia.
One of the Toebbes' communications indicated that English might not be the country's native tongue, and others suggest that the country's navy is familiar with nuclear propulsion technology.","toebbes, pleads, engineer, husband, information, navy, secrets, guilty, wife, plot, countrys, submarine, toebbe, nuclear, sub, pleaded",Man-Made Disaster

The move will halve remaining nuclear capacity in Germany and reduce energy output by around four gigawatts - equivalent to the power produced by 1,000 wind turbines.
Protests over the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 prompted Dr Merkel to set the wheels in motion for abandoning nuclear power just over 10 years ago.

The strains were evident all week as the Biden administration sought to bring the alliance with Israel into a united front about how to deal with Iran over the next year.

The company hopes to build 16 of the plants, known as small modular reactors, and said each could power around a million homes.
The British government will contribute a grant of £210 million to develop the plants, while Rolls-Royce and its partners, including Exelon Generation, a US nuclear power company, and BNF Resources, a private company, would together invest £195 million over three years.
The government is looking for sources of clean power to replace Britain's ageing nuclear plants, although the Rolls-Royce models are unlikely to come online for at least a decade.","power, build, hopes, britain, million, reduce, plans, billion, nuclear, small, plants, rollsroyce, company",Man-Made Disaster

A decade after triple meltdowns at Fukushima forced mass evacuations and a shut-down of the nuclear industry, Japan has restarted only a third of its 33 operable reactors.
Mr Amari said Japan must revert to nuclear power to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality pledge, avoid rapidly rising prices of imported coal and gas and to cut its reliance on other countries for energy needs.
He faces a tight race in his home district, where he is struggling to attract support from anti-nuclear junior coalition partner, Komeito.
Mr Ono cited local distrust caused by what he called multiple mishaps by the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Holdings (Tepco).","reactors, power, race, kishidas, resistance, election, ahead, party, mr, faces, tokyo, nuclear, push, plants, japan, antinuclear, restarted",Man-Made Disaster

The United States has a stockpile of 3,750 nuclear warheads, of which 1,389 were deployed as of Sept 1.
Beijing has dismissed US fears over its military development, and on Thursday accused the Pentagon report of aiming to ""hype up talk of the China nuclear threat"".

To meet its global climate commitments, the country will need to restart almost every nuclear reactor it shuttered in the aftermath of the 2011 meltdowns, and then build more.
""We had better hurry and rebuild trust in nuclear power,"" said Mr Masakazu Toyoda, a member of the 24-strong government panel that's devising new policies.
Nuclear now accounts for about 6 per cent of Japan's energy mix, down from roughly 30 per cent of the Fukushima disaster.

The United States had said Friday that it had offered ""very serious"" ideas on reviving the accord but was waiting for Teheran to reciprocate, something Saturday's move signally failed to do.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran is currently only allowed to use ""first-generation"" IR-1 centrifuges for production, and to test a limited number of IR-4 and IR-5 devices.
Iran has demanded that the United States first lift all sanctions imposed by Mr Trump, including a sweeping unilateral ban on its oil exports, before it falls back in line with obligations it suspended.

It was likely no coincidence, analysts noted, that North Korea said its newest SRBM could carry a 2.5-tonne warhead.
North Korea says its missiles are for self-defence, and has accused South Korea and the United States of threatening its safety with joint military drills, arms purchases, and other hostile policies.

Mr Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in White House talks on Friday that he was putting ""diplomacy first"" to try to rein in Iran's nuclear programme but that if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei drew a parallel on Saturday between the Biden administration's approach to the nuclear accord to that of former President Donald Trump, who withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
Mr Trump's withdrawal from the accord aimed to pressure Iran into negotiating stricter curbs on its nuclear programme, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces.","illegally, talks, threatened, biden, threatening, teheran, options, official, irans, mr, iran, trump, nuclear, president, security",Man-Made Disaster
257,02/2021,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi on Sunday, made after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Teheran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency today.

Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since the United States, under former president Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.

The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms.

US President Joe Biden has said he wants to talk about both nations returning to the accord, though the two sides have been at odds about who makes the first step.

Teheran over the weekend renewed its demand that the US rejoin the accord and lift its crippling sanctions on Iran before talks can resume.

A key part of Iran's plan for reducing cooperation is to end implementation of the additional protocol, under which Teheran allows the IAEA to carry out unannounced inspections of nuclear material and installations where undeclared activity is suspected.

""The additional protocol, much to my regret, is going to be suspended,"" Mr Grossi said.

While the IAEA can still enter Iran to account for declared nuclear stockpiles, oversight of places such as machine shops and mines involved in uranium enrichment will be lost, as will camera surveillance of Iranian nuclear sites.

The IAEA and Teheran earlier issued a joint statement saying Iran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.

The IAEA will also continue ""necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months"", the statement said, without specifying what those activities are.

Former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran, prompting Teheran to violate some of the pact's nuclear restrictions.

Mr Chung is the first South Korean prime minister to visit Iran in 44 years amid icy relations between the two countries due to Iran's military cooperation with North Korea.
Tension rose after Iran seized a South Korean ship and its sailors in the Strait of Hormuz in January, accusing them of polluting the waters, and demanded that Seoul release US$7 billion in assets frozen in South Korean banks under US sanctions.
Iran and world powers held talks last week aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal that former US president Donald Trump abandoned three years ago.

Many people now seem perplexed or angered by the Moon government's possible bid to build a nuclear power plant in the North while domestically adhering to a nuclear phaseout policy.
A spokesperson for Mr Moon immediately rebuffed Mr Kim's statement as irresponsible and misleading, pledging to take legal measures against him.

""No doubt it is a step in the right direction,"" Mr Putin said at the World Economic Forum summit being held virtually this year, addressing the body for the first time since 2009.

But the Russian leader warned: ""The situation can still develop unpredictably and uncontrollably if we sit on our hands.""

Earlier yesterday, 399 Russian lawmakers in Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted in favour of extending the agreement, with no votes against or abstentions. The upper house ratified the treaty extension later yesterday.

Mr Putin submitted a Bill extending the accord after the Russian leader and new US President Joe Biden held their first phone call on Tuesday evening. The treaty was set to expire on Feb 5.

Signed in 2010, the New Start is a cornerstone of global arms control. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the US and Russia to 1,550 each, as well as the number of land",Putin hails extension of Russia-US nuclear arms pact as a positive step,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/putin-hails-extension-of-russia-us-nuclear-arms-pact-as-a-positive-step,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON • Russia and the United States have struck a deal to extend the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear arms control treaty, the Kremlin said, a move that preserves the last major pact of its kind between the world's two biggest nuclear powers.

Spy agencies in recent weeks circulated a classified analysis about the efforts underway inside Saudi Arabia - working with China - to build industrial capacity to produce nuclear fuel.
Even if the kingdom has decided to pursue a military nuclear programme, they said, it would be years before it could have the ability to produce a single nuclear warhead.
Saudi officials have made no secret of their determination to keep pace with Iran, which has accelerated since US President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal with Teheran.
Last week, the House Intelligence Committee included a provision in the intelligence budget authorisation bill requiring the administration to submit a report about Saudi efforts since 2015 to develop a nuclear programme.","weapons, produce, examines, officials, kingdom, programme, uranium, intelligence, arabia, nuclear, efforts, lead, saudi",Man-Made Disaster

Iran had previously only reached 20 per cent purity, and that was already a breach of the deal, which says Iran can only enrich to 3.67 per cent.
Iran made the step up to 60 per cent in response to an explosion that damaged equipment at the larger, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz.

South Korea strongly protested against the decision, summoning Mr Koichi Aiboshi, Tokyo's Ambassador in Seoul, and convening an intra-agency emergency meeting to craft its response.
Mr Moon also expressed concerns about the decision as Mr Aiboshi presented his credentials, having arrived in South Korea in February for the ambassador's post.

The passage fuelled debate in South Korea over whether it meant Washington or Pyongyang would detonate 80 bombs against each other.

The push sets up a new confrontation at the Security Council, where European allies are resisting the so-called snapback sanctions in a last-ditch attempt to hold together the fraying 2015 accord.
""The enforcement mechanisms will be just the same enforcement mechanisms we have for all of the UN Security Council resolutions,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference.
The Trump administration had for months warned that it would seek to trigger the UN sanctions if an arms embargo against Iran was allowed to expire in October, as scheduled under the nuclear deal.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, flanked by other top members of President Donald Trump's national security team, also told reporters that Washington had imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has forged closer ties between Caracas and Teheran.

""For nearly two years, corrupt officials in Teheran have worked with the illegitimate regime in Venezuela to flout the UN arms embargo,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""Our actions today are a warning that should be heard worldwide.""

Mr Pompeo said that Mr Trump has issued an executive order ""that is a new and powerful tool to enforce the UN arms embargo"".

He did not offer details on what the US sanctions were.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who appeared with Mr Pompeo, also announced separate sanctions on the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran.

The US has triggered a ""snap back"", or resumption, of virtually all UN sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, to come into effect at 8pm on Saturday.

A major part of Washington's new push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms.

Under the 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States had unilaterally pulled out of in 2018, the UN conventional arms embargo is set to expire on Oct 18.

Other parties to the nuclear deal and most United Nations Security Council members have said they do not believe the US has the right to reimpose the UN sanctions and that Washington's move has no legal effect.

The move yesterday freezes any US assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them, while extending secondary sanctions to those who do business with them. This means foreign banks risk losing access to the US market and financial system.

The Treasury Department said in a statement the prohibitions did not apply to transactions to sell agricultural commodities, food, medicine or medical devices to Iran, saying it understood the need for humanitarian goods.

493,08/2020,"UNITED NATIONS • A controversial bid by the United States to reimpose international sanctions on Iran has been blocked by the United Nations, with the Security Council saying it could not proceed with the disputed move.

The presidency of the UN Security Council, assumed this month by Indonesia, is ""not in a position to take further action"" on Washington's request, said ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani on Tuesday.

In a video conference on the Middle East, the Indonesian diplomat cited the lack of consensus in the UN's highest body on the US strategy as the main reason.

The Trump administration accuses Teheran of failing to comply with the terms of the historic 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and is demanding the Security Council reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Washington insists on its legal right to trigger the disputed procedure, called ""snapback"", despite pulling out of the deal two years ago.

The move threatens to torpedo the Iran accord and plunge the Security Council into crisis, while widening the gulf between the US and almost every other member on Iran policy. Thirteen of the 15 Council members had written to the Indonesian presidency to reject its validity.

The US ""is alone"" in the approach, and its ""ultimate goal is to destroy the nuclear agreement when it has already imposed (national) sanctions on Iran"", a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP. Another said that with the sound rejection of the US bid by almost the entire council, ""normally the matter is closed"".

The US did not see it that way. ""We reminded members of our right under Resolution 2231 to trigger snapback, and our firm intent to do so in the absence of courage and moral clarity by the council,"" said US ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft.

The move, never before used, comes after the US suffered a humiliating defeat at the Security Council earlier this month when it failed to muster support for a resolution to extend a conventional arms embargo on Iran. According to the 2015 agreement, in which sanctions against Iran were lifted in exchange for it agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons, a notification that Teheran has broken its promise must in principle be followed by a draft resolution by the presidency of the Security Council.

The exclusion of this option by Indonesia was welcomed on Tuesday by most of the Council members.

The Iranian mission to the UN welcomed the council's rejection of the US move. Iran said the US request, ""including all references therein, are null and void, have no legal standing and effect and are thus completely inadmissible"".

Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards also issued new threats to the US, with senior commander Abdollah Araghi warning of ""harsher revenge soon"", following the missile strikes, Iranian media reported.

The new head of Iran's Quds Force, which overseas its foreign military operations, said he would follow the course pursued by his predecessor Major",Teheran spurns Trump's call for new nuclear pact,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/teheran-spurns-trumps-call-for-new-nuclear-pact,"BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON • Iran has spurned US President Donald Trump's call for a new nuclear pact, and a commander threatened more attacks, after both sides appeared to back off from intensified conflict following the US killing of an Iranian general and Teheran's retaliatory missile strikes.
Yesterday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Iran's President Hassan Rouhani to end the confrontation with the US and underlined London's commitments to Teheran's nuclear agreement, Downing Street said.
EU chief Charles Michel also defended the crumbling Iran nuclear deal yesterday, but warned Teheran against ""irreversible acts"" that would sink the accord.
More broadly, Iran is likely to remain focused on the goal of forcing the expulsion of US troops from Iraq.

By gradually restarting their nuclear programme in staggered increments, Iran's leaders hope to pressure the Europeans to provide help evading the US sanctions, or at least to drive a wedge between the Europeans and Mr Trump.

They said over the weekend that they plan to push ever further over the limits of the nuclear deal in leaps every 60 days unless Western governments honour their end of the bargain.

Iran could also retaliate against the US with conventional military force.

Tehran demonstrated its capabilities last month by shooting down an American surveillance drone flying at high altitude. And the US has also blamed Iran for using naval mines to damage six petroleum tankers in two attacks in the waters around the Persian Gulf.

But direct attacks against the US risk retaliation ",The Iran crisis: How we got there and what's next,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/the-iran-crisis-how-we-got-there-and-whats-next,"But direct attacks against the US risk retaliation - Mr Trump only narrowly aborted a missile strike for the downing of the drone.
Iran may hope that Americans will elect a new president in 2020 who could revive the deal.
Each step Iran takes past the deal's limits increases the risk that the European countries might restore their own sanctions, effectively nullifying the accord.
Either by accelerating its nuclear progress or violent retaliation, directly or through allies, Iran raises the risk of US military action.

Mr Abe, who has developed friendly ties with Mr Trump, travelled to Iran in June in an unsuccessful effort to encourage Iran and the US to hold talks to reduce tensions.

Iran's foreign minister told reporters in New York that Iran could immediately ratify a document prescribing more intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme if the US abandoned its economic sanctions, media organisations reported.
The document, known as the Additional Protocol, gives UN inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) more tools to verify that a nuclear programme is peaceful.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal agreed to by Teheran, Iran must seek ratification of the protocol eight years after the deal was adopted.

Iran's announcement that it would resume enrichment at the Fordow plant from midnight had drawn a chorus of concern from the remaining parties to the troubled agreement.
The resumption of enrichment at Fordow is Iran's fourth move away from the deal.

But the Americans argued that decommissioning Yongbyon did not suffice, calling for Pyongyang to transfer nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the US.

North Korea had also said it dismantled its Sohae missile launch site as an initial step toward denuclearisation, but the facility was used on Sunday (Dec 8) for what Pyongyang said was a ""very significant test"".

North Korea has stepped up calls for the US to end joint military drills with South Korea, as well as retracting its ""hostile policy"" including criticising Pyongyang's human rights record.

'COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE'

US officials came to Stockholm seeking a ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"" of North Korea, and pushed for a moratorium on weapons tests as a first step, a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Although some media reports said the US had planned to propose temporarily lifting sanctions on coal and textile exports, the source said the Stockholm talks did not get into details.

Washington and Seoul have contemplated possible areas where sanctions be eased on the condition they can be immediately put back if needed, such as a resumption of South Korean tours to the North.

North Korea, in contrast, has sought a ""systematic guarantee"" for the lifting of sanctions, singling out five UN resolutions at the Hanoi summit, the source said.

The five UN resolutions, adopted in 2016 and 2017, chiefly limited North Korea's mineral exports and banned financial transactions, which were expected to prevent Pyongyang from earning at least US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) a year.

""But the Americans can't take the risk of easing sanctions first, having already given a lot of gifts to Kim without substantial progress on denuclearisation, including summits,"" the source said.

""Sanctions are basically all they have to press North Korea.""

US negotiators tried to fix a date for the next round of talks when the Stockholm meeting fell apart, but North Korean officials were uncooperative, the source said.

Maj-Gen Soleimani's successor, Maj-Gen Esmail Ghaani, stood near Ayatollah Khamenei's side, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top leaders.
Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump is confident he could still renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Teheran, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said yesterday.

United States President Donald Trump and Mr Macron spoke about the breach by telephone on Monday night, said the White House.
Uranium has to go through a process of enrichment to be used to produce energy in a nuclear reactor.

598,12/2019,"MOSCOW • A new intercontinental weapon that can fly at 27 times the speed of sound has become operational, Russia's defence minister reported to President Vladimir Putin, bolstering the country's nuclear strike capability.

Mr Putin has described the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle as a technological breakthrough comparable to the 1957 Soviet launch of the first satellite.

The new Russian weapon and a similar system being developed by China have troubled the United States, which has pondered defence strategies.

The Avangard is launched atop an intercontinental ballistic missile, but unlike a regular missile warhead that follows a predictable path after separation, it can make sharp manoeuvres in the atmosphere en route to target, making it much harder to intercept.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed Mr Putin that the first missile unit equipped with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle entered combat duty on Friday. ""I congratulate you on this landmark event for the military and the entire nation,"" he said later during a conference call with military leaders.

The Strategic Missile Forces chief, General Sergei Karakayev, said during the call that the Avangard was put on duty with a unit in the Orenburg region in the southern Ural Mountains.

Mr Putin unveiled the Avangard among other prospective weapons systems in his state",New Russian weapon travels at 27 times the speed of sound,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/new-russian-weapon-travels-at-27-times-the-speed-of-sound,"MOSCOW • A new intercontinental weapon that can fly at 27 times the speed of sound has become operational, Russia's defence minister reported to President Vladimir Putin, bolstering the country's nuclear strike capability.

It carries a nuclear weapon of up to 2 megatons.

Iran said the resumption of enrichment at Fordow would be carried out transparently and witnessed by inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But Russia, which has close ties with Iran, expressed concern about the latest move.

605,04/2020,"WASHINGTON • US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is preparing a legal argument that the country remains a participant in the Iran nuclear accord that President Donald Trump has renounced, part of a strategy to pressure the UN Security Council to extend an arms embargo on Teheran or see far more stringent sanctions reimposed on the country.

The strategy has been described in recent days by administration officials as they begin to circulate a new resolution in the Security Council that would bar countries from exporting conventional arms to Iran after the current ban expires in October.

Any effort to renew the arms embargo is almost certain to be opposed by Russia and, publicly or quietly, by China.

The Russians have already told American and European officials that they are eager to resume conventional arms sales to Iran.

In an effort to force the issue, Mr Pompeo has approved a plan, bound to be opposed by many of Washington's European allies, under which the United States would, in essence, claim that it legally remains a ""participant state"" in the nuclear accord that Mr Trump has denounced ",Pompeo to use nuclear accord Trump rejected to extend Iran arms embargo,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/pompeo-to-use-nuclear-accord-trump-rejected-to-extend-iran-arms-embargo,"Any effort to renew the arms embargo is almost certain to be opposed by Russia and, publicly or quietly, by China.
If the arms embargo is not renewed, the US would exercise that right as an original member of the agreement.
European diplomats who have learned of the strategy maintain that Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo are selectively choosing whether they are still in the agreement to fit their agenda.
Asked about the strategy, Mr Pompeo told The New York Times: ""We cannot allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to purchase conventional weapons in six months.

""I would like to study how we will scrap them, not how to retain them,"" Mr Shinjiro Koizumi said at his first news conference late on Wednesday (Sept 11) after he was appointed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Japan has six reactors operating at present, a fraction of the 54 units before Fukushima.

In contrast, the US has followed the principle of ""America First"", broken agreements and withdrawn from multilateral mechanisms in recent years, Mr Zhao said.

India is engaged in ongoing tensions with nuclear rival Pakistan over its decision to revoke autonomy of Kashmir region, to which both countries stake a claim.
Mr Singh tweeted after visiting India's nuclear weapons testing site at Pokharan.
Since a series of nuclear tests in 1998, India declared a ""no-first-use"" policy under which it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict with its neighbours, but will retaliate should deterrence fail.
Unlike Pakistan, India's other neighbour and rival China has also declared a no-first-use policy on nuclear weapons.","ministry, nofirstuse, singh, policy, tweeted, weapons, reconsidering, india, doctrine, hints, spokesman, rival, nuclear, pakistan",Man-Made Disaster

Iran is acting on its May 8 threat to suspend from today parts of the nuclear agreement in response to US President Donald Trump's reimposition of crippling sanctions on Teheran after withdrawing from the deal in May last year.

The accord caps Iran's enrichment maximum at 3.67 per cent, sufficient for power generation but far below the more than 90 per cent level required for a nuclear weapon.

Uranium enrichment ""will increase as much as needed for our peaceful activities"", Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, international affairs adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in an interview published on Friday on the leader's official website.

Breaching the limit would be a symbolic move but would not put Iran significantly closer to building a nuclear weapon.
The 300kg limit of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent is suitable for use in power plants but falls far short of the more than 90 per cent enriched uranium needed for fissile material in a nuclear bomb.

Iran's initial moves do not appear to violate the nuclear deal yet.
But Iran has warned that unless the world powers protect Iran's economy from US sanctions within 60 days, Iran would start enriching uranium at a higher level.
It is also well below the 20 per cent level to which Iran enriched uranium before the deal.","deal, halts, teheran, official, uranium, commitments, iran, cent, nuclear, produce, powers, world",Man-Made Disaster

The sanctions would snap back into place if North Korea failed to meet its side of the bargain, Yonhap reported.
Mr Kim subsequently resumed tests of short-range ballistic missiles and warned that he would wait only until the end of the year for a change in the US position.

It has been a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future, and printed in full in the Rodong Sinmun mouthpiece newspaper.
Professor of international studies Park Won-gon at Handong University in South Korea said the change of format may have been to avoid ""burdening"" Mr Kim.

Mr Trump walked away from his previous round of talks with Mr Kim after the North Korean leader sought the removal of all UN sanctions passed in 2016 and 2017, in exchange for dismantling Yongbyon.
Mr Kim subsequently resumed tests of short-range ballistic missiles and warned that he would wait only until the end of the year for a change in the US position.","korean, halts, talks, yonhap, north, sanctions, programme, kim, mr, trump, lift, korea, nuclear",Man-Made Disaster
765,07/2019,"WASHINGTON • The United States has decided not to impose sanctions on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for now, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign Washington may be holding a door open for diplomacy.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said on June 24 that Mr Zarif would be blacklisted that week, an unusual public stance because the US typically does not preview such decisions to keep its targets from moving assets out of the country's jurisdiction.

Blacklisting Iran's chief negotiator would also be unusual because it could impede any US effort to use diplomacy to resolve its disagreements with Teheran over the country's nuclear programme, regional activities and missile testing.

The sources who spoke on Thursday did not give specific reasons for the decision.

To do so, the US would have to grant him a visa, another sign that Washington is holding off on sanctions for now.
US-Iran ties have deteriorated since President Donald Trump last year unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, and decided in early May to use US sanctions to try and eliminate Iran's oil exports entirely.","sign, washington, spoke, foreign, sanctions, unusual, united, irans, week, zarif, minister, blacklist, sources",Man-Made Disaster

A spokesman for North Korea's foreign ministry accused the United States of trying to shift the blame for the breakdown of the second summit between Kim and Trump, in Hanoi in February, by raising a ""completely irrelevant issue"".
""Unless the United States ... comes forward with a new method of calculation, the DPRK-US dialogue will never be resumed and by extension, the prospect for resolving the nuclear issue will be much gloomy,"" the official added.
The statement was the latest criticism of the United States since the failed summit in Vietnam and came just hours before Trump left for a state visit to Japan, where he is expected to discuss North Korea with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Mr Trump however said he could be open to ""various smaller deals"" to achieve the denuclearisation of North Korea in a more incremental manner, which would be a departure from his and his administration's all-or-nothing approach so far.
""There are various smaller deals that maybe could happen,"" said Mr Trump in remarks before his meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, with whom he said he would discuss ""certain humanitarian things"" for North Korea.
Mr Moon is on a whirlwind 24-hour visit to Washington DC in the hopes of encouraging the United States and North Korea to continue their talks, following the abrupt end of the Hanoi summit between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.
The complete denuclearisation of North Korea remains the ultimate goal of negotiations, said both presidents, with Mr Moon stressing that South Korea was ""absolutely on the same page"" as the US on the issue.","washington, summit, denuclearisation, talks, north, various, sanctions, right, trump, moon, mr, korea, ease",Man-Made Disaster

Last Saturday's attacks on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oilfield led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels per day of the kingdom's crude oil production, equivalent to more than 5 per cent of the world's daily supply.

The United States government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom's crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq.

Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.

""There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, (we) are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!"" Mr Trump said on Twitter on Sunday.

US Energy Secretary Rick Perry pinned the blame squarely on Iran for ""an attack on the global economy and the global energy market"".

The 2015 deal only lets Iran produce enriched uranium with just over 5,000 of its first-generation IR-1 centrifuge machines.
It can use far fewer advanced centrifuges for research but without accumulating enriched uranium.
Last week the Islamic Republic said it would breach the deal's limits on research and development, the term applied to Iran's use of advanced centrifuges.

Around 60 per cent of Okuma will remain a no-go zone due to high levels of radiation, while the order has been in place for Futaba, the other town that co-hosts the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, run by Tokyo Electric Power.
Wednesday's move comes eight years after a powerful earthquake and ensuing tsunami caused a triple meltdown at the plant, forcing the government to issue the evacuation order to tens of thousands of residents.
For the past eight years, Okuma residents have been evacuated to other parts of Fukushima or outside the prefecture.
Even if the order is lifted for the rest of the town, many residents would be reluctant to return home due to fears about radioactive contamination, Mr Kowata said.","power, orders, residents, fukushima, lifted, plant, radiation, cent, tokyo, town, okuma, nuclear, evacuation, order",Man-Made Disaster

Biegun was to meet separately in Washington with Lee Do-hoon, Seoul's chief nuclear envoy, and Japan's Kenji Kanasugi, with a three-way meeting also expected, according to the US State Department.
Their talks take place after US President Donald Trump abruptly cut short the Feb 27-28 summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un amid fundamental differences between the two sides over dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.

920,03/2019,"A senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday Washington was keen to resume talks as soon as possible, but North Korea's negotiators needed to be given more latitude than they were ahead of the summit.

He said no one in the US administration advocated an incremental approach North Korea has been seeking and the condition for its integration into the global economy, a transformed relationship with the United States and a permanent peace regime, was complete denuclearisation.

""Fundamentally, where we really need to see the progress, and we need to see it soon, is on meaningful and verifiable steps on denuclearisation. That's our goal and that's how we see these negotiations picking up momentum.""

The official, who did not want to be identified, said the US side still saw North Korea's complete denuclearisation as achievable within Trump's current term, which ends in January 2021. While the official said he would ""not necessarily share the conclusion"" that the Sohae site was operational again, any use of it would be seen as ""backsliding"" on commitments to Trump.

The US remains opposed to Mr Moon's recent suggestion that Seoul consider allowing South Korean citizens to make individual trips to the North.
Concern about objections from China might also keep the Moon administration from working with the US to beef up the missile defence system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD).
The North fired 25 projectiles, including short-range ballistic missiles and a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in 13 rounds of tests last year.
It now appears to be preparing to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland, ending a hiatus on such tests since November 2017.","herald, deployed, system, ballistic, trips, north, tests, thaad, moon, launchers, korea, defence, missile, seoul",Man-Made Disaster

Neither the US nor South Korea have confirmed North Korea fired a ballistic missile, which would be in violation of international agreements and complicate their current detente with Pyongyang.
Rather than condemn the move, US and South Korean officials played down the threat, a move analysts said could keep the door open for nuclear negotiations but also signal to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he has the green light to do more short-range testing.

The official spoke after North Korea conducted its largest missile test since 2017 on Sunday.

That year North Korea flight-tested the Hwasong-12 at least six times, achieving three successful flights and three failures.

North Korea recently resumed rail-borne trade with China, its key supporter - another signal that the poverty-stricken regime needs outside help.

The launch came after North Korea had fired two cruise missiles into the sea off its east coast on Tuesday, adding to the tension over its tests.

Mr Wang told his Iranian counterpart on Friday that China would continue to ""oppose illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran"", the foreign ministry said.
A 2015 deal - agreed by Iran, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - offered Teheran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme.
But the US withdrew from the agreement in 2018, reimposing biting sanctions and prompting Teheran to begin rolling back on its commitments.","deal, oil, implementation, sweeping, foreign, teheran, sanctions, iran, strategic, begin, agreement, wang, iranian, china",Man-Made Disaster

Teheran has repeatedly demanded the release of about US$7 billion of its funds frozen in South Korean banks under US sanctions, saying Seoul was holding the money hostage.

During the past 10 years, twice as long as the presidential tenure in South Korea, Kim Jong Un has done many things.
Kim Jong Nam, Jong Un's half-brother who was wandering around the world after losing his father's favour, was murdered in a poisoning attack by hired hands.
Kim Jong Un also confirmed the traditional friendly ties with China and Russia through meetings with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.","korean, koreas, jong, s, herald, columnist, end, power, north, kim, party, presidential, moon, korea, war, influence, uns",Man-Made Disaster

All of the missiles are hard to intercept, and they target South Korea.
The SLBMs recently developed by South Korea without nuclear weapons are entirely different from North Korea's, which can carry nuclear warheads.
President Moon Jae-in said late last month that North Korea was only raising tensions at a low level.
This is intended to drive a wedge between South Korea and the US -- and, further, to cause division in the South.","korean, herald, koreas, dialogue, north, precautions, declaration, south, moon, korea, nuclear, missile",Man-Made Disaster

Fears are mounting that a conflict in Ukraine could cause an energy crisis in Europe, which depends heavily on Russian supplies.
But Tokyo's offer comes with frenetic diplomatic manoeuvring under way in an attempt to ease tensions with Russia over Ukraine.
""We have communicated to both the US and EU that this co-operation is to be carried out only to the extent that it does not affect Japan's electricity and gas supplies,"" he said.

The missiles may also be too fast to be stopped by Patriot surface-to-air missiles that defend against low-altitude rockets, weapons experts said.
""If China was able to deploy one, that would basically neutralise US missile defence,"" Dr Li said.

North Korea first tested a hypersonic missile in September, joining a race headed by major military powers to deploy the advanced weapons system.
Hypersonic weapons are considered the next generation of arms that aim to rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said two ballistic missiles were detected and called the spate of launches since last month ""extremely regrettable"".
Tuesday's missile could be a new mini SLBM displayed at North Korea's defence exhibition a week ago, officials said.

Taiwan’s main opposition party the Kuomintang, or KMT, which traditionally favours close ties with Beijing, is hoping to make a comeback in key mayoral elections late next year.
Saturday’s two most contentious referendums asked whether to ban imports of pork containing the leanness-enhancing additive ractopamine on safety grounds, and whether to relocate a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to protect a reef.
It says the LNG terminal will secure energy supplies for the semiconductor-producing island, hit by power cuts in May.

The President's withdrawal from Afghanistan makes clear that he saw risking more US lives there as no longer in America's national interest.
The Biden doctrine sees China as America's existential competitor, Russia as a disrupter, Iran and North Korea as nuclear proliferators, cyber threats as ever-evolving and terrorism as spreading far beyond Afghanistan.

The officials' comments came in a series of statements carried on state news agency KCNA, after the White House on Friday said US officials had completed a months-long review of North Korean policy.
The human rights criticism is a provocation that shows the United States is ""girding itself up for an all-out showdown"" with North Korea, and will be answered accordingly, the unnamed spokesman said.
The comment also came as Biden is scheduled to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on May 21, with Seoul saying that North Korea would be high on the agenda.

Kishida's ritual offering to the shrine is the latest reminder of difficulties in letting South Korea and Japan leave the long-running dispute over their shared history behind them.
Seoul-Tokyo ties have been at their lowest ebb in recent years with Japan reacting strongly against court rulings here on compensation for South Korean victims of wartime forced labour and sexual enslavement.
Japan has claimed all reparation issues related to its colonisation of the peninsula were settled by a 1965 treaty with South Korea that normalised bilateral ties.
But Friday's phone talks between Moon and Kishida showed South Korea and Japan still had many obstacles to huddle over to settle historical discord.","korean, herald, shrine, disappointing, south, moon, tokyo, japans, korea, war, kishida, japan, seoul, signals",Man-Made Disaster

The Biden administration's lack of direct engagement with North Korea should not be seen as an indication that the challenge posed by its weapons programmes was not a priority, department spokesman Ned Price said.
North Korea continued to make progress in its nuclear and missile programmes in recent years ""which makes this an urgent priority for the United States and one that we are committed to addressing together with our allies and partners,"" Mr Price said.
""And ... the central premise is that we remain committed to denuclearisation of North Korea,"" he said.

Hypersonic missiles, like traditional ballistic missiles which can deliver nuclear weapons, can fly at more than five times the speed of sound.
But ballistic missiles fly high into space in an arc to reach their target, while a hypersonic missile flies on a trajectory low in the atmosphere, potentially reaching a target more quickly.
Crucially, a hypersonic missile is manoeuvrable (like the much slower, often subsonic cruise missile), making it harder to track and defend against.
While countries like the US have developed systems designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles, the ability to track and take down a hypersonic missile remains a question.","hypersonic, target, report, capability, space, tests, ballistic, missiles, defend, sources, missile, china, test",Man-Made Disaster

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the executive order was expected to be issued in the coming days and would allow the president to punish violators with secondary sanctions, depriving them of access to the US market.
The proximate cause for the US action is the impending expiry of a UN arms embargo on Iran and to warn foreign actors - US entities are already barred from such trade - that if they buy or sell arms to Iran they will face US sanctions.
Mr Trump's executive order is intended to show that the United States will not be deterred despite failing to win broader UN.
Another of the sources, a European diplomat, said the new executive order would put teeth behind Washington's assertion that the UN arms embargo would remain in place beyond October by giving the president secondary sanctions authority to punish arms transfers to or from Iran with US sanctions.","states, deal, embargo, sanctions, united, plans, order, trump, iran, punish, nuclear, sources, arms, executive, trade",Man-Made Disaster

The Pentagon, which historically has not disclosed details about US training or advising of Taiwanese forces, did not specifically comment on or confirm the deployment.

The sources declined to say how long the training had been going on but suggested it predated the Biden administration, which came into office in January.

Ms Pelosi said in a letter to Democratic lawmakers that she spoke to General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about what measures are available to rein in the Republican President.

Mr Trump, angry about his election loss, incited supporters in the days before to an invasion of the US Capitol last Wednesday.

""The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,"" Ms Pelosi said in the letter to her colleagues.

While Ms Pelosi's letter highlights the concern among lawmakers about what Mr Trump may try to do during his remaining time in office, there are questions about what Gen Milley or anyone could actually do to stop a president from using nuclear weapons.

""There is no legal way to do this. The President has sole, unfettered authority to order the use of nuclear weapons with no 'second vote' required,"" said Professor Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

But the North still remains unresponsive to calls from the South through cross-border communication lines, tantalizing the Moon government, which is so eager to resume dialogue with Pyongyang.
He described the measure as a barometer of the North's willingness to resume dialogue with the South.
The North seems to be attempting to draw out a response from the South by dangling the prospect of yet another inter-Korean summit in addition to the end-of-war declaration.
Indeed, the administration decided last week to provide up to 10 billion won (S$11.4 million) to help fund humanitarian aid programs for the North.","herald, jong, summit, north, kim, interkorean, conciliation, south, moon, week, korea, deceptive, seoul, pyongyang",Man-Made Disaster

Indonesia is worried that the pact, known as Aukus, under which Australia will obtain nuclear submarine technology from the US, would worsen an ""arms race and power projection"" in the region.
""This will reinforce our ongoing cooperation with key countries like Indonesia to make sure that we have a free and open Indo-Pacific that respects the rule of law,"" US ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Kim Sung, told a virtual forum.
Mr Kim said he is not worried about an arms race or nuclear proliferation, calling it a ""forward looking, positive"" initiative that would work in Indonesia's favour.
Asked about its restive easternmost region of Papua, Mr Kim said Washington did not support separatism anywhere, but did have concerns over fundamental freedoms in the militarised region and urged talks between the government and local communities.","worried, race, pact, region, kim, response, indopacific, aukus, mr, indonesia, envoy, southeast, particularly, threat, stability",Man-Made Disaster

Mr Biden will come into office facing the thorny task of engineering a breakthrough in the stalemate, after a second summit between Mr Kim and outgoing US President Donald Trump in 2019 failed to reach agreement.
Mr Kim is one of the few world leaders yet to acknowledge the US election results.
Mr Biden has called Mr Kim a ""thug"" and said he would meet the North Korean leader only if he made moves to reduce his nuclear arsenal.
Such meetings have slowed since Mr Trump walked out of a February 2019 summit with Mr Kim and the North Korean leader resumed ballistic missile launches.","korean, diplomatic, expand, jong, biden, north, relations, ahead, kim, era, mr, south, ties, korea, nuclear, missile, vows, leader",Man-Made Disaster

A new Dosan Ahn Chang-ho submarine successfully carried out the underwater ejection tests last week, after similar tests were conducted from a submerged barge last month, Yonhap reported, citing unnamed military sources.
SLBMs have been developed by seven other countries, including the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, India, and North Korea.
Yonhap said the conventionally armed South Korean missile has reportedly been codenamed the Hyunmoo 4-4 and is believed to be a variant of the country's Hyunmoo-2B ballistic missile, with a flight range of around 500km.
South Korea has developed increasingly powerful missiles designed to target heavily fortified bunkers and tunnels in North Korea, as well as a way to decrease its military dependence on the US, which stations thousands of troops on the peninsula.","submarinelaunched, military, weapons, ballistic, yonhap, tests, south, media, week, korea, defence, submarine, missile",Man-Made Disaster

Taipei has complained for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force, often in the south-western part of the air defence zone near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands.
The Chinese aircraft flew in an area closer to the Chinese than Taiwanese coast, roughly north-east of the Pratas, according to a map provided by Taiwan's defence ministry.

The regime already had cautionary tales such as the death of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, whom the US helped topple less than a decade after he gave up his own nuclear weapons.
Just weeks before Mr Trump's first unprecedented meeting with Mr Kim in June 2018, then US National Security Adviser John Bolton proposed that North Korea adopt the ""Libya model"" of disarmament - a remark that the president disavowed.

1440,04/2021,"AstraZeneca vaccine trial in children paused as clot link probed

A British trial of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine on children has been paused, Oxford University said on Tuesday, as global regulators rush to assess its possible link to rare blood clots in adults.

The university, which helped develop the embattled vaccine, said in a statement that there were ""no safety concerns"" in the trial, but acknowledged fears over a potential link to clots by saying that it was awaiting additional data from Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before restarting the study.

It is the latest drama to hit AstraZeneca, which has been embroiled in controversy over its failure to deliver promised doses to the European Union, and over the jab's efficacy and safety profile.

The MHRA is one of many bodies across the globe analysing real world data from the AstraZeneca rollout to see if there is a definitive link between the jab and a rare form of blood clot, after cases were initially reported in Norway and continental Europe.

The warning by Air Force General Glen VanHerck on Tuesday appeared to be based on North Korea's unveiling at a parade last October of what would be its largest ICBM yet, and not specific intelligence about an imminent launch.

Still, he made his remarks a day ahead of a debut trip by the Biden administration's top diplomat and defence secretary to South Korea, underscoring US concerns that Pyongyang may resume testing of missiles and nuclear weapons after a hiatus of more than three years.

Even during the testing lull, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for continued production of nuclear weapons for his arsenal, launched a series of smaller missiles and unveiled the ICBM.

Gen VanHerck told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Pyongyang's ""considerably larger and presumably more capable"" ICBM further increased the threat to the United States.

Still, he expressed confidence in US missile defences.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire will be in Washington on Tuesday (Sept 3) in part to discuss the mechanism. One diplomat said that might be when the United States gives its response to French proposals.

At a Group of Seven meeting in France last month, Mr Trump appeared open to the idea of credit lines, although US officials have since ruled out lifting sanctions.

Iran says it aims to keep the nuclear deal alive, but cannot abide by it indefinitely unless the European countries that signed it ensure it receives the promised economic benefits.

Teheran has called on the Europeans to accelerate their efforts to alleviate the impact of US sanctions. President Hassan Rouhani stressed on Tuesday that Iran would take its next step in scaling back its nuclear commitments by Thursday unless the Europeans keep their promises to salvage the deal.

The first source said talks for now did not go into how the credit lines would be repaid, although it would require Iranian oil exports to resume eventually. Certain countries were discussing with France possible involvement in such a mechanism.

""Importing the oil at some point is essential, but we need to have the agreement of the Americans.

The United States will nonetheless continue indirect talks with Iran on the US rejoining the 2015 nuclear accord that Donald Trump abandoned, the spokesman also said.
Raisi is seen as close to 81-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate political power in Iran.
The discussions in Vienna, brokered by European diplomats, have been locked in dispute on which sanctions imposed on Iran would be lifted.","process, vienna, win, iran, raisi, spokesman, electoral, fair, states, washington, united, free, iranians, talks, state, denied, political, nuclear, regrets",Man-Made Disaster

1571,02/2019,"SEOUL/HANOI • North Korea warned US President Donald Trump yesterday not to listen to US critics who were disrupting efforts to improve ties, as its leader, Mr Kim Jong Un, made his way across China by train to a second summit with Mr Trump in Vietnam.

The two leaders will meet in Hanoi on Wednesday and Thursday, eight months after their historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting United States president and a North Korean leader, where they pledged to work towards the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.

But their vaguely worded agreement has produced few results and US Democratic senators and US security officials have warned Mr Trump against cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

The North's KCNA state news agency said such opposition was aimed at derailing the talks. ""If the present US administration reads others' faces, lending an ear to others, it may face the shattered dream of the improvement of the relations with the DPRK and world peace and miss the rare historic opportunity,"" the news agency said in a commentary, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The Trump administration has pressed the North to give up its nuclear weapons programme, which, combined with its missile capabilities, poses a threat to the US, before it can expect any concessions.

In a series of tweets yesterday on the eve of his departure for the summit, Mr Trump said North Korea could become one of the world's ""great economic powers"" if it relinquished its nuclear arsenal.

""Chairman Kim realises, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the world,"" he wrote",North Korea tells Trump to ignore critics as Kim heads to summit,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/n-korea-tells-trump-to-ignore-critics-as-kim-heads-to-summit,"SEOUL/HANOI • North Korea warned US President Donald Trump yesterday not to listen to US critics who were disrupting efforts to improve ties, as its leader, Mr Kim Jong Un, made his way across China by train to a second summit with Mr Trump in Vietnam.

1572,02/2019,"That, along with Mr Trump's complaints about the cost of stationing US troops in South Korea, sparked worries among some American lawmakers that Mr Trump might bargain away some of the US military presence, but officials, and Mr Trump himself, say that is not on the table.

Other US priorities include agreeing on a specific roadmap for future negotiations and securing a freeze on all development or manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.

In his annual New Year's speech, Mr Kim declared that North Korea ""would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them"", but it does not appear to have halted weapons production and a Stanford University study released this month said it may have produced enough fissile material in the past year to have added as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.

In a step South Korean officials see as the minimum needed to secure some American concessions, North Korea has said it could allow international inspectors to observe the dismantlement of its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, which has produced plutonium and highly enriched uranium for weapons.

Mr Kim has demanded ""corresponding measures"" from the US side and analysts doubt he will accept anything less than at least some easing of sanctions in return for the destruction of Yongbyon or other facilities.

""It's clear what North Korea wants the most is sanctions to be eased,"" said Mr Park Won",US team lowers expectations for second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/us-team-lowers-expectations-for-second-summit-with-nkoreas-kim,"""It's clear what North Korea wants the most is sanctions to be eased,"" said Mr Park Won-gon, dean of international affairs at South Korea's Handong Global University.

1582,05/2020,"WASHINGTON • United States President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw from another major arms control accord, according to senior administration officials, and will inform Russia today that the US is pulling out of the Open Skies treaty, negotiated three decades ago to allow nations to fly over one another's territories with elaborate sensor equipment to assure they are not preparing for military action.

Mr Trump's decision will be viewed as more evidence that he may also be poised to exit the one major arms treaty remaining with Russia: New Start, which limits the US and Russia to 1,550 deployed nuclear missiles each. It expires weeks after the next US presidential inauguration.

US officials have long complained that Moscow was violating the Open Skies accord by not permitting flights over a city where it was believed Russia was deploying nuclear weapons that could reach Europe, as well as forbidding flights over major Russian military exercises.

And, in classified reports, the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies have contended that the Russians are using flights over the US to map out critical infrastructure that could be hit by cyber attacks.

But Mr Trump's decision is bound to further aggravate European allies, including those in Nato, who are also signatories to the treaty.

They will remain in the accord, but have warned that, with Washington's exit, Russia will almost certainly respond by cutting off their flights, too, which the allies use to monitor troop movements on their borders.

The decision marks the third time Mr Trump has renounced a major arms control treaty. Two years ago he abandoned the Iran nuclear accord. Last year he left the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty.

""Europeans are still in the mood of salvaging the deal,"" said Dr Naysan Rafati, the International Crisis Group's Iran analyst.

""The Europeans actually agree with the Americans on a lot when it comes to Iran, but they diverge on whether to try and keep the JCPOA alive as a basis for discussions.""

While European officials have kept quiet publicly, Iran has lashed out at US threats.

'STOP DREAMING'

""2 yrs ago, @SecPompeo and his boss declared 'CEASING US participation' in JCPOA, dreaming that their 'max pressure' would bring Iran to its knees,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted.

""Given that policy's abject failure, he now wants to be JCPOA participant. Stop dreaming: Iranian Nation always decides its destiny.""

With the nuclear accord in limbo, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to the deal, reducing the time it would take for Teheran to build a nuclear bomb to less than a year, according to a senior Western diplomat.

The embargo's end would theoretically allow Iran to move ahead with purchases of conventional weapons from Russia and China.

That could let Iran modernise its forces by buying advanced weapons systems that it has mostly been unable to acquire for decades, including advanced fighter aircraft and main battle tanks, the Pentagon warned in November.

Yet even if the embargo were to expire, plenty of obstacles remain for Iran to buy weapons.

Secondary US sanctions, for instance, would make any country think twice before selling to Iran. The European Union also has its own arms embargo on Iran.

The issue is a top political priority for Mr Trump, with the October expiration coming just weeks before presidential elections in the US.

Hawkish advisers to the Trump administration think the US shouldn't even waste time with a UN resolution, going straight to the snapback option instead.

""It's useless to waste time trying to extend the arms embargo with a resolution that is likely to fail,"" said Mr Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, which has helped guide the Trump administration's Iran sanctions policies.

""Even if you could get Russians to agree, all you've done is gained a very short",US targets expiring Iran arms embargo at risk of angry allies,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-targets-expiring-iran-arms-embargo-at-risk-of-angry-allies,"Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said Security Council members should ""take the US threat seriously"" when it comes to the arms embargo and the snapback proposal.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last month announced Japan would aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a major shift for the world's third-largest economy which relies heavily on imported fossil fuels for its energy sources.
The emergency, non-binding declaration - drafted by a cross-party group of legislators - cites ""unprecedented damage"" from hurricanes, flooding and forest fires, exacerbated by climate change at home and abroad, and said the world faces a ""climate crisis"".
The government is developing measures including investment funds and tax incentives to push through changes needed to reach the net zero emissions target, and Mr Furukawa said the declaration would give impetus to those efforts, given its non-partisan backing.
Announcing the new emissions target, Prime Minister Suga said Japan would ""pursue nuclear power"", along with introducing as much renewable energy as possible, without specifying precise plans for reactors.","target, worlds, world, group, goal, declare, climate, zero, lawmakers, sets, emissions, vote, declaration, emergency, japan",Man-Made Disaster

Before Trump's executive order for the sanctions, a senior White House official said Washington would impose more economic curbs on Teheran 'very soon' and had warned Europe to stop doing business with the Islamic Republic.
""Today's action targets Iran's revenue from the export of industrial metals - 10 per cent of its export economy - and puts other nations on notice that allowing Iranian steel and other metals into your ports will no longer be tolerated,"" Trump said in a statement.

But Mr Biden indicated that he was also willing to meet Mr Kim, saying that his condition would be that Pyongyang works to make the Korean peninsula ""a nuclear-free zone"".
The exchange of harsh rhetoric between Mr Kim and Mr Biden contrasts with the personal relationship that the North Korean leader developed with Mr Trump.
Mr Trump and Mr Kim have met three times and exchanged letters since 2018 to try to reach a deal on dismantling the North's nuclear weapons programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

If Washington was not prepared to discuss global problems with Moscow, Russia stood ready to have that discussion with other nations, said Mr Putin, who was speaking via video link.

As things stand, Kim has not been sincere, and the denuclearisation work between the US and North Korea has made little progress since Trump and Kim held their historic meeting in Singapore last June.
Then Trump may need to take a different attitude and strategy to get Kim to abide by his denuclearisation promise.
Trump is well known for his impulsive, emotional comments, which disclose what is in his mind.

1624,02/2019,"""DENUCLEARISATION?""

Ms Sanders complained on Fox News last week that American media had manufactured ""high expectations"" for the summit.

After agreeing to cease military exercises with South Korea after their first summit without anything substantive from Mr Kim in exchange, Mr Trump's critics fear the President may again be talked into a US concession.

""This is where the President's unpredictability, his impulsiveness, his inclination not to prepare for meetings could get us into trouble,"" said Mr Victor Cha, the Korea Chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, whom the Trump administration considered nominating for ambassador to South Korea.

Vietnamese authorities began positioning troops and military vehicles in the capitol's streets early on Tuesday in preparation for the two leaders' arrivals.

Mr Kim, who left Pyongyang on an armoured train, arrived in the morning, while Mr Trump's plane is expected in the evening. Ms Sanders didn't say where the two men would have dinner on Wednesday, and the White House also hasn't said where they will hold their formal summit on Thursday.

Mr Trump will be joined at dinner by his chief of staff, Mr Mick Mulvaney, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Mr Kim will also be joined by two aides, Ms Sanders said. She didn't identify them.

Mr Trump has groused that his negotiations with North Korea haven't garnered more praise and credit, bragging recently to reporters that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Mr Abe would not confirm that assertion. And the President is acutely aware of his reputation as a foreign policy novice.

Yet the US' moves to lower expectations have underscored the major challenges the Trump administration faces as it attempts to persuade Mr Kim that giving up nuclear weapons promises greater reward than keeping them.

Talks between Washington and Pyongyang have been deadlocked since the two leaders' first summit in Singapore last June. Rather than show progress towards denuclearisation, North Korea has continued to build warheads and missiles, according to satellite",Trump's high-profile summit with Kim seen yielding low returns,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/trumps-high-profile-summit-with-kim-seen-yielding-low-returns,"After agreeing to cease military exercises with South Korea after their first summit without anything substantive from Mr Kim in exchange, Mr Trump's critics fear the President may again be talked into a US concession.

1628,08/2019,"SEOUL • There is no question that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in full control of his nation.

But a recent change to how he is formally described in the country's Constitution may allow him even more diplomatic leverage as he steps with increasing confidence onto the world stage for negotiations over his nuclear weapons programme.

Last Friday, North Korea said that its Parliament will hold its second meeting of the year on Aug 29.

It follows weeks of intensified weapons tests, belligerent statements over military exercises between the United States and South Korea this month, and the slow pace of nuclear talks with the US.

Analysts say the North's new constitutional changes, which show Mr Kim's consolidation of his already formidable powers, could allow him to act more clearly as a diplomat on the world stage.

This could include technically signing a peace treaty with US President Donald Trump, for instance, or giving speeches at the United Nations General Assembly.

The changes, which were made public recently on the North Korean government's Naenara Web portal, appear linked to an unusual political reality there: While Mr Kim is the undisputed leader, it is his grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung, who is enshrined as North Korea's eternal president.

It is not illegal under international law to buy and haul Iranian oil or related products. The Trump administration's oil sanctions, which mainly went into effect in November after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement, are unilateral. The administration granted eight governments permission to continue buying Iranian oil despite the sanctions, but ended the exceptions on May 2.

Foreign companies that ignore the sanctions and do business with American companies or banks risk being punished by the US.

US officials have said sanctions are aimed at cutting off money to the Iranian government to force leaders there to make political change, transform their foreign policy and offer more concessions on the country's nuclear and missile programmes.

While Iran continues to export oil, the sanctions have had a substantial impact. In April 2018, before Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, Iran exported 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. One year later, that figure was at one million. And in June, after the end of the exceptions or waivers, ships in Iranian ports loaded about 500,000 barrels per day, according to Reid I'Anson, an energy economist at Kpler, a London","Defying US sanctions, countries have taken oil from 12 Iranian tankers",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/defying-us-sanctions-countries-have-taken-oil-from-12-iranian-tankers,"It is not illegal under international law to buy and haul Iranian oil or related products.

Blacklisting Iran's chief negotiator would also be unusual because it could impede any US effort to use diplomacy to resolve its disagreements with Tehran over Iran's nuclear programme, regional activities and missile testing.
In a sign of how close Washington came to taking action, the US Treasury internally circulated a draft press release announcing sanctions on the Iranian foreign minister.
Mr Zarif is expected to attend a ministerial meeting at the United Nations next week on sustainable development goals, which aim to tackle issues including conflict, hunger, gender equality and climate change by 2030.
To do so, the US would have to grant him a visa, another sign Washington is holding off on sanctions for now.","secretary, sign, washington, foreign, sanctions, unusual, united, irans, week, zarif, minister, blacklist, sources",Man-Made Disaster

Teheran dragged Washington to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague in 2018 after Trump pulled the US out of a landmark international nuclear deal with Iran.
Iran says the sanctions brought back by the Trump administration breach the 1955 ""Treaty of Amity"" between the two countries, signed long before the 1979 Iranian revolution severed ties.
The US responded by formally ending the treaty, agreed when Iran was ruled by the Western-oriented Shah, and accusing Iran of using the ICJ for ""propaganda"" purposes.

The ruling Workers' Party of Korea will also ""discuss important matters arising... in the building of the state and national defence"", KCNA added.
In April last year, at the start of nuclear talks with the United States, North Korea held the same Workers' Party meeting and announced that it would suspend nuclear and ICBM tests and shift its national focus to developing the economy.

Both contracts settled up more than US$2 a barrel after the Opec+ decision and on optimism about energy demand after US President Joe Biden outlined a US$2 trillion (S$2.69 trillion) infrastructure spending plan.
Under Thursday's agreement, Opec+ cuts would be just above 6.5 million bpd from May, compared with slightly below 7 million bpd in April.
Most of the increase in supplies will come from the world's top exporter, Saudi Arabia, which said it was phasing out its extra voluntary cuts by July, a move that will add 1 million bpd.
Ahead of the talks, Iran's foreign ministry said it wanted the United States to lift all sanctions and rejected any ""step-by-step"" easing of restrictions.","slip, oil, talks, barrel, million, agree, united, prices, week, bpd, cuts, output, us2, opec, ease",Man-Made Disaster

The three contracts were awarded for the development of glide phase interceptors and together are worth more than US$60 million (S$82 million), the Pentagon said.
In October the US successfully tested hypersonic missile technology, which is already being deployed by China and Russia.
The Pentagon recently confirmed that China in August carried out a test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that would be difficult to defend against, and has said that Beijing is expanding its arsenal more quickly than anticipated.","hypersonic, contracts, ballistic, protection, taps, attacks, pentagon, million, awarded, giants, missiles, defence, defend, missile, china",Man-Made Disaster

South Korea has been the target of a wave of angry statements recently from the North, which has accused Seoul of allowing defectors to launch leaflets critical of leader Kim Jong Un into its territory.

Mr Kwon denounced Seoul for trying to ""meddle"" in the process in the statement, which was carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency and concluded with the warning: ""It is better to stop nonsensical talking about denuclearisation.""

Ties plunged during President Donald Trump's tenure as tensions arising from historical differences touched off a trade dispute that at one point threatened global supply lines for semiconductors and nearly led South Korea to abandon a joint intelligence-sharing agreement.

1772,03/2021,"Ten years after the tsunami and nuclear disaster that struck Japan, the country's experience in getting through that devastating tragedy remains a guide in a world where disruptive natural challenges need to be met through social resilience. On March 11, 2011, the strongest earthquake in Japanese history, with a magnitude of 9.0, triggered a tsunami that reached a height of over 30m in some areas. The monster waves also engulfed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing reactor meltdowns in what was one of the world's worst nuclear accidents. Contemporary Japanese history was altered forever by the iconic devastation of Fukushima.

However, the Japanese character was not altered.

The hockey footage did not allude to the crisis, but the president's office said earlier on Saturday that Lukashenko had ordered the distribution and delivery of humanitarian aid to the migrants at the border.
Separately, Lukashenko said he wanted to receive Russian nuclear-capable Iskander missile systems to deploy them in the south and west of the country in an interview with a Russian defence magazine published on Saturday.","plays, belaruseu, minsk, lukashenko, west, hockey, team, sanctions, published, migrants, sharpens, russian, ice, border, migrant, crisis, project",Man-Made Disaster

Mr Khamenei, the most prominent individual targeted in the latest sanctions, for example, never travels outside Iran and the conglomerate he controls, Setad, has little reliance on international banking.

The new sanctions, which prohibit him from entering the United States or doing business with American financial institutions, will have almost no impact on the ayatollah.

The same appears to be true for most of the other individuals sanctioned on Monday. Several are senior officers of the Revolutionary Guard. The Trump administration in April designated the Guard as a terrorist organisation, and that prohibited them from entering the United States or doing business with Americans.

Yet the gesture may still come at a cost. Under the Iranian political system, Mr Khamenei's personal assent is required to open any talks with the United States, and the new sanctions are unlikely to win him over. What is more, in addition to being Iran's paramount political leader, Mr Khamenei is revered by some Iranians as a singular spiritual authority as well, and those Iranians may also be offended.

Six coal- and gas-fired power units, with a combined capacity of 3.6 gigawatts, are offline due to the quake without any timeline for restart, according to the Japan Electric Power Exchange.
Eneos Holdings said it had temporarily suspended the Sendai refinery, while some units at the Negishi refinery were halted.
