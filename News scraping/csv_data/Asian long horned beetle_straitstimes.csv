Walker's death was confirmed by his son Brian.

Walker had the longest tenure of any cartoonist on an original creation, King Features, which began its syndication of Beetle Bailey in 1950, said in a statement.

""Little did I know when I was drafted that I was going to get almost four years of free research,"" Walker recalled in his collection The Best Of Beetle Bailey (1984).

11,05/2017,"But the couple missed the Beetle so much that they started looking for another soon after, with the hope of passing it to their daughter one day.

""The year was 2008 and we felt we were ready for a second car,"" Madam Lim says. ""It was also only natural that we wanted another Beetle. This time around, we desired a 1950s model or one that looked similar.""

Madam Lim also had a few other criteria. ""Firstly, the car must be of the right look for its age. In other words, it cannot be from the 1950s and have a modern steering wheel, lights and seats,"" she says.

""It must also have the correct registration number. Classic cars cannot have modern numbers.

""Lastly, the overall condition must be good. While I understand that old cars will have some rust, dents and scratches, I don't want to spend a fortune to repair it.""

The couple found a listing on online car portal sgCarMart that matched what they wanted.

""When I saw the advertisement, it stated that the black Beetle was registered in 1971. However, the accompanying photos showed a car which looked like it was from the 1950s,"" Madam Lim says.

""When I called the owner, who is a violinist, I found out that the car had been converted to look like the 1950s model. I made an appointment to take a closer look with my husband and when we saw it, we were pleased with its condition.""

They paid ""a higher price"" than what comparable Beetles commanded then. The car had only one year left on its certificate of entitlement (COE), but ""thankfully, the price to renew the COE was very low then"", Madam Lim says.

Since purchasing the car, the couple have spent about $23,000 on refurbishments such as bodywork, upholstery and having it repainted beige.

The Beetle is driven by Mr Ong daily while Madam Lim ferries Yan Qi and her brother in a Toyota Wish MPV, which they bought new in 2012.

So what does Yan Qi think of the ride that she will inherit one day?

""I like sitting in it because it doesn't have any seat belts, but I wish daddy would turn on the aircon more often as it can get quite hot inside,"" she says.

""Also, I like it when my brother accompanies me because he can enjoy the ride too.""

18,02/2022,"Singapore has at least 25 native dung beetle species, of which at least 23 are tunnellers that belong to this Onthophagus genus.

According to Assistant Professor Nalini Puniamoorthy from the department of biological sciences at NUS, male dung beetles hang out at the entrances of these underground tunnels which are usually dug by females.

Larger males would fight one another for a chance to mate with the female, often using their large horns as a weapon to defend their territory.

The winner gets to mate with the female which lays her eggs in brood balls, which are developmental chambers that she builds out of dung. The male victor continues to defend the female and her brood balls by fighting off other males at the tunnel entrance.

""This is driven by an evolutionary mechanism called sexual selection, where certain traits that increase an individual's reproductive fitness are selected. In this case, horn length and body size are important traits that increase mating success,"" said Prof Nalini.

That being said, many dung beetle species exhibit an interesting alternative mating strategy: the sneaky male tactic.

Small males (with no horns or small horns) can mimic females and sneak past the large guarding males to mate with the female beetles in the tunnel. These male species usually ""compensate"" by having large testes, or more sperm, which in this case, would be a key reproductive trait that influences fertilisation success.

When I became interested in more ""exotic"" animals, I learnt that it was illegal in Singapore to keep all but a small range of domestic pets such as dogs, cats, rodents, fish and birds. The closest I got to an unusual pet was collecting various queen ants from wooded areas and reservoirs and breeding them into colonies.

Later, while attending boarding school in Britain, I was free to rear a gargoyle gecko in a terrarium in my room. These and many other reptiles are common pets in many countries and freely available from pet shops and online breeders.

86,06/2020,"World Environment Day, which falls on June 5 every year, was made more memorable in Singapore with a rare sighting last Friday: a colony of over 100 large flying foxes soaring over the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.

The last time such bats were seen in Singapore was more than four years ago, when six were sighted in the MacRitchie area in May 2016.

Dr Benjamin Lee, director of wildlife management research at the National Parks Board (NParks), said: ""This sighting of more than 100 individuals is unprecedented in Singapore in recent times.""

Primate researcher Sabrina Jabbar caught sight of the bats while exercising in the nature reserve at about 7.30am last Friday, and captured the encounter in photographs and videos.

Ms Jabbar said the sighting on World Environment Day was a great surprise. ""It was such a magnificent sight against the backdrop of the cloudy sky,"" she added.

Dr Lee said the large flying fox, a fruit bat, is native to Singapore.

They are migratory animals, which means they have a large home range and move frequently across international borders.

They have been known to travel several hundreds of kilometres between roosting sites, and their home range includes southern Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra in Indonesia, said Dr Lee.

""It is not unusual for flying foxes to travel in large groups when they are in search of food or due to disturbances to their camps such as habitat destruction or sustained hunting,"" he added.

Ms Jabbar said that while it was nice to see the flying fox in such large numbers, the animals may have been forced to move due to threats faced elsewhere, such as habitat loss. ""I hope they have found a safe place to settle,"" she said.

88,05/2020,"While I agree with Mr Christiaan Starke that exposure to animals will encourage a better understanding of them, that exposure does not come only from having pets (Opening up pet industry would widen horizons, May 22).

Like Mr Starke, I was exposed to many animals in my childhood. But for me, the animals were in their natural habitat, instead of in captivity. I found the teamwork of industrious ants, agility of lizards catching their prey and the intelligence of birds to be captivating.

Children's interests are easily piqued and it pays to introduce them to nature early so that they learn not to ""react with fear or disgust when faced with animals that are not commonly seen"", as Mr Starke put it.

The exposure can be done in gardens and parks, instead of staring at captive pets in tanks or terrariums at home. Being outdoors brings additional health benefits and Singapore's lack of seasons makes going outdoors possible all year round.

There is no lack of variety in Singapore's fauna either. For example, Mr Starke's interest in beetles can be satisfied by going to accessible places such as the Dairy Farm, Lorong Halus and catchment areas to observe the many different species.

Mr Starke's call for a negative instead of a positive list of illegal pets might result in too many species being brought into Singapore. With the country's high population density, there is a high probability of conflict among residents, as one man's pet may be another man's pest.

From your pictures, the plants may be planted too close to each other. Your Jatropha integerrima plants are blocking sunlight from your Murraya paniculata plants.

As your plants are grown in a sheltered area where sunlight comes from only one direction, move the planter box so that the plants are exposed to the maximum amount of sunlight. Space them out well so that they do not block each other.

Different plants have varying growth rates. Some gardeners like to grow a range of plants together mainly for aesthetic reasons.

A mixture of plants can provide a visually attractive contrast of leaf textures, colours and growth forms. However, this needs to be done carefully, taking into account each plant's growth rates and requirements. Competition can do more harm than good.

However, companion planting may help to deter certain pests from particular plants.

And every year, the world's top chefs and food buyers flock to Alba, a city in the Piedmont region of northern Italy, to buy the world's best truffles at the International Alba White Truffle Fair.

Unlike black truffles, no cultivation technique has been developed for the white variety, which is rarer and grows only in the wild.

One must forage in the woods, where they grow symbiotically with oak, hazel, poplar and beech trees.

Though white truffles can also be found in certain parts of France, Croatia and Slovenia, they grow particularly well in the countryside around the Piedmontese cities of Alba and Asti, where truffle hunters dig for them from late September to December every year.

The fair is an opportunity for the hunters to showcase and sell their white treasures, which fetch prices anywhere from €50 (S$79) to tens of thousands of euros apiece.

Always buy toys that have the battery compartment secured with screws to lower the chance of a child obtaining the button battery, said Dr Dennis Chua, a consultant otolaryngologist (ENT) from Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

A button battery stuck in the nose is an emergency that needs immediate attention because it can burn through the nose in 15 minutes, depending on the amount of moisture in the nose and whether it is a fresh battery, he said.

Lastly, in a given population, cannibalism is often directly related to the degree of overcrowding.

ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) edging are common edging materials for cabinets in Singapore.
To get the same tone for the edging and laminate, consider laminates which are coloured throughout the sheet.
Decorate walls with washi tape or decalsI am renting, so how can I dress up my walls without putting in nails and hooks?
If you like the D-I-Y route, consider using washi tape to create patterns on walls, doors, light switch plates, window glass - practically any flat surface.","washi, edges, laminate, edging, edge, singlecolour, tape, termites, walls, say, wood, cabinet, holes, experts, laminates",Pest and disease outbreaks
191,06/2016,Singapore is his first picture pitstop at a South,Photographer Joel Sartore is halfway through quest to shoot every species in captivity,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/zooming-in-on-captives-big-and-small,"He arrived here 13 days ago and has shot 150 species at the four wildlife parks - Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park - under the Wildlife Reserves Singapore.
The American flies back home to Lincoln, Nebraska, today before continuing his global quest in Spain later this month.
The shoots are no breeze either as he has to consider the best way to make each shoot as comfortable as possible for each species.
Unsure if he will be able to shoot all the species in captivity, he asserts that he will die trying.
""He knows how to light, shoot and edit, but he can't do it as long as I can move,"" Sartore cheekily adds.","photographer, started, halfway, singapore, wildlife, quest, sartore, shoot, joel, small, species, zoo, animals, captivity, think",Pest and disease outbreaks
192,07/2016,"NEW YORK • If you think New York's wildlife is limited to pigeons and squirrels, Dr Howard Rosenbaum, the director of the ocean giants programme at the New York Aquarium on Coney Island, has some surprising news. ""In less distance out to sea than the average New Yorker's commute home, there is likely a whale singing at this very moment,"" the marine biologist said.

At least seven species have been sighted offshore. They include the largest animal that has ever lived, the blue whale, and one of the most endangered creatures on earth, the North Atlantic right whale. There are also humpback, fin, sei, mine and sperm whales. As to why so many whales are passing through New York's waters ",New York's whale of a project,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/new-yorks-whale-of-a-project,"They include the largest animal that has ever lived, the blue whale, and one of the most endangered creatures on earth, the North Atlantic right whale.
Researchers will identify whale species by their distinctive call patterns and will approximate their locations on continually updated digital maps.
Small-scale whaling in Long Island dates to the 1640s; the blubber of the right whale was used for lamp oil and to make soap and margarine.
All of New York's whale species are listed as endangered, and human activity continues to have a lot to do with that status.
The New York project will monitor ship noise to assess if it is having negative effects on whale behaviour.","dr, whales, island, whale, york, marine, species, ship, long, yorks, project",Pest and disease outbreaks
