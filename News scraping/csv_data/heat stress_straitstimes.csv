0,11/2021,GLASGOW (BLOOMBERG) ,One billion people to face deadly heat stress if world warms 2 deg C,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/one-billion-people-to-face-deadly-heat-stress-if-world-warms-2-deg-c,"GLASGOW (BLOOMBERG) - One billion people will be at risk of extreme heat stress if global warming causes the world's temperature to rise by 2 deg Celsius, new modeling shows.
A study by the Met Office, the United Kingdom's's national meteorological service, warned that a 2 deg C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet.
A 4 deg C rise would mean that nearly half of the world's population could be living in affected areas, according to the research, released at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The Met Office used an indicator which combines warmth and humidity, known as wet-bulb temperature, to assess heat stress risk.
Limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C is a key goal of this year's climate talks, where ""keeping 1.5 alive"" has become an unofficial motto.","met, impacts, temperature, heat, billion, c, world, rise, deg, warms, stress, face, deadly, warming, risk, climate",Severe weather disruptions

Bleaching occurs when healthy corals become stressed by spikes in ocean temperatures, causing them to expel algae living in their tissues which drains them of their vibrant colours.
The Great Barrier Reef has suffered three mass bleaching events during heatwaves in 2016, 2017 and 2020, leaving many affected corals struggling to survive.

33,12/2020,"PREVENTING HEAT STRESS IN BULLDOGS

I have a French bulldog that loves being outdoors. I avoid taking him out when the weather is too hot or humid as I am afraid he will be overheated. What are some symptoms of heat exhaustion? What should I be mindful of when my dog is overheated?

Cher Ang

Dogs naturally get rid of excess heat by panting and, to a much lesser extent, sweating.

Brachycephalic dog breeds, including the French bulldog, are more susceptible to heat stress as the structure of their heads can affect their ability to pant effectively.

Heat stress can then manifest as excessive panting and increased thirst. If left unmanaged, it can progress to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which has more severe signs such as weakness, collapse, disorientation and seizures. Heat stroke can also potentially result in multiple organ failure and death.

To minimise heat stress, avoid walking your dog in direct sunlight during the hottest times of the day and never leave him tied up under the sun or locked in a car.

If there are visible signs of heat stress when outside, take him to a water dispenser and provide fresh, cool drinking water.

Take him to the vet if the signs of heat stress are prolonged or not improving despite taking the measures above.

Corals rely heavily on symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae for food.
These algae, which usually float freely in the ocean, are absorbed into coral tissue, where they thrive in the relatively protected environment.
Bleaching occurs when abnormally high water temperatures or other environmental stressors cause corals to expel the zooxanthellae living in them, turning the corals white.
Dr Erdmann, who does research in Raja Ampat, believes that the answer to the resilience of the sprawling reefs in Raja Ampat lies in the diversity of algae living in the coral.","zooxanthellae, raja, singapore, temperatures, coral, cool, warming, tissue, corals, algae, weather, seas, ampat",Severe weather disruptions

Its stress test examined how 48 economies would be impacted by the effects of climate change under four different temperature increase scenarios.
As global warming makes the impact of weather-related natural disasters more severe, it can lead to substantial income and productivity losses over time, it said.
For example, rising sea levels result in loss of land that could have otherwise been used productively and heat stress can lead to crop failures.
Emerging economies in equatorial regions would be most affected by rising temperatures.","lose, change, swiss, gdp, temperatures, fifth, stress, world, rising, cent, study, severe, action, risk, climate",Severe weather disruptions

111,07/2018,"LEARN TO DISSIPATE HEAT

Under hot, humid conditions like those in Singapore, races are generally planned for early or late in the day to mitigate the effects of heat and weather on runners.

What runners can do to help themselves is to condition for the race through structured race preparation and training.

HYDRATE DURING THE RUN

Just as in a car where the engine cooling system depends on coolant fluid for heat transfer and dissipation, our body depends on water to play a similar role.

As we run, most of the water is lost through perspiration and respiration. Keeping ourselves well hydrated before, during and after a race is key to ensuring that our bodies are able to cope with the heat stress of exercising, on top of the hot, humid conditions.

While training for my half",Preparation vital to avert injuries,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/preparation-vital-to-avert-injuries,"What runners can do to help themselves is to condition for the race through structured race preparation and training.
I had been away in the Netherlands and the chilly weather meant my long runs were comfortable affairs and I was afforded the illusion of luxury of not hydrating myself.
I recall having read about a young athlete who had just flown in from a temperate region and did not have enough race preparation and sleep before his race in Singapore.
As a result, faster runners had to swerve to overtake, which can lead to collisions and injuries.

133,09/2017,"The human body is made up of 70 per cent water and it is essential for a wide range physiological functions in the body, such as sweating. Sweating is a mechanism to cool down our body during physical activity or when the body is overheated.

While it is an effective means by which the body counters heat stress, excessive sweating without proper replenishment can lead to repercussions.

Ninety per cent of our blood plasma consists of water. Excessive sweating will therefore reduce the blood volume we have in our bodies. Our blood flows in vessels, very much like the pipes that deliver water to our homes.

When a water shortage occurs, water has to be rationed and each household will receive less water. Similarly, when there is reduced blood volume, less blood is available to flow through the vessels and to supply the muscles.

Blood carries red blood cells which in turn carries oxygen to our muscles. A reduction in blood volume requires the heart to work harder to supply oxygen and nutrients to the exercising muscles.

This scenario is further complicated when there is also competition for blood supply to the skin to promote convective heat loss.

While severe clinical dehydration rarely occurs during exercise, a less hydrated body is nonetheless more susceptible to thermal strain during exercise. In other words, our bodies overheat faster when we are dehydrated.

Moreover, research has also shown that endurance performance is affected when athletes' fluid loss exceeds two per cent of their body weight.

Clearly, a good hydration strategy is critical for safe and successful endurance running.

Endurance runner and ONEathlete Banjamin Quek shared those sentiments. He said: ""Our body loses water up to two per cent of our weight when we work out. Therefore, we need to hydrate in order to run over a long distance.""

More is not always better when it comes to drinking. One of the important salts in our blood is sodium. Excessive water consumption may overly dilute the sodium concentration, a condition known as hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia can pose a serious threat with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, muscle cramps, seizures and even the onset of coma.

I have a number of rhapis palms in my garden and patio. They are about 1.5m to 1.6m tall. I am curious why the leaves of this plant tend to turn brown at the tips which eventually lead to the whole stalk becoming brown. Is there any treatment to prevent this?

Your plant could be suffering from a deficiency in potassium. The lack of this nutrient occurs in older leaves where the yellow colour starts at the leaf tip and spreads inwards.

Dead, necrotic spots will also appear in such areas. Over time, pathogenic fungi may infect these areas.

Ensure that the soil is not too compacted, regular watering is done and the plant is not growing in waterlogged ground. These factors can affect the potassium uptake by your palm.

As the lines between work and family blur, the ""extra stress can result in disappointment and even resentment, causing them to lose emotional regulation"", she says.

While this can happen to both mothers and fathers, Ms Wong says mums are more prone to it as they tend to be the primary caregivers.

Focus on the Family's survey of 1,076 mothers in March and last month bears this out.

Sixty per cent of mums surveyed by the local charity rated their stress level as seven out of 10, a marked increase from 52 per cent in last year's survey.

The report notes that mothers are at risk for poor emotional and mental health as well, as more than six in 10 respondents had insufficient sleep of six hours or less.

Ms Wong says parents should look out for these emotional red flags: setting too many rules and being triggered when their child does not follow them, being too controlling and using methods such as shouting and hitting and blaming the child for misbehaviour.

""The truth is, it is not the child's fault. The child is only being a child. We all know this, yet we unconsciously expect them to have the intellectual capacity and behaviour of an adult,"" she says.

The power supply crunch, brought about by environmental controls, supply constraints and soaring prices, has forced industries throughout the country to cut production, and left several provinces scrambling to guarantee electricity and heating for residents.
Goldman Sachs estimated that as much as 44 per cent of China's industrial activity has been affected, leading to a 1-percentage point decline in annualised GDP growth in the third quarter, and a 2-percentage point cut from October to December, it said.
Nomura earlier cut its third and fourth-quarter China GDP growth forecasts to 4.7 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively, from 5.1 per cent and 4.4 per cent previously, and its full-year forecast to 7.7 per cent from 8.2 per cent.

All of the above are important in minimising your risk of cardiovascular disease, but it's equally vital to get screened by a health professional every year. This is especially important because certain heart diseases, such as aortic valve stenosis, may not present any symptoms, even if there is severe damage to the valve.

Valve stenosis happens when the opening of the valve is smaller than normal, so blood cannot flow through properly.

""This disease can affect one or more heart valves, and one may be born with an abnormally formed valve or it may occur as one ages due to wear and tear. If severe aortic valve narrowing is left untreated, up to 50 per cent of patients may die from the condition in just two years,"" says Dr Paul Chiam, interventional cardiologist.

""To repair the valve and improve your life span, doctors may perform a minimally invasive treatment called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to replace a new valve onto the damaged valve. Unlike open heart surgery, this procedure can be performed under local anaesthesia without the need for open chest surgery,"" he explains.

""Heart diseases, if left untreated, could deteriorate and lead to more severe conditions like heart failure, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood sufficiently throughout the body. It is therefore important not to ignore any pain or symptoms you may experience, such as chest tightness or breathlessness,"" says Dr Lim.

In cases of heart failure that do not respond to medication, doctors may then suggest surgery to implant an artificial heart pump called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to help restore normal blood flow to the body and relieve the symptoms of heart failure.

269,08/2016,"I teach a medical school course on homeostasis: how organ systems work together to maintain physiological balance.

For example, when blood pressure drops acutely, the heart speeds up and the kidneys retain sodium and water, propelling blood pressure back to normal. If body temperature falls, we shiver to generate heat, blood vessels constrict to conserve heat, and we warm up. Homeostasis is about preserving constancy in the face of changing conditions. As a model for explaining human physiology, it does remarkably well.

However, there are aspects of the human condition that homeostasis cannot explain. For instance, blood pressure often fluctuates from minute to minute. If the body is supposed to be maintaining an optimal set point, it doesn't seem to be doing a very good job. Blood pressure also increases steadily throughout childhood and adulthood. Why does the set point drift upward? To explain these things, some experts have proposed an alternative theory to homeostasis: allostasis.

Allostasis is not about preserving constancy; it is about calibrating the body's functions in response to external as well as internal conditions.

The body doesn't so much defend a particular set point as allow it to fluctuate in response to changing demands, including those of one's social circumstances. Allostasis is, in that sense, a politically sophisticated theory of human physiology. Indeed, because of its sensitivity to social circumstances, allostasis is in many ways better than homeostasis for explaining modern chronic diseases.

Consider hypertension. Seventy million adults in the United States have it. For more than 90 per cent of them, we don't know the cause. However, we do have some clues. Hypertension disproportionately affects blacks, especially in poor communities. This may in part be because of genetics, but it is doubtful that this is a major factor; American blacks have hypertension at much higher rates than West Africans. Moreover, hypertension is also common in other segments of society in which poverty and social ills are rampant.

Dr Peter Sterling, a neurobiologist and a proponent of allostasis, has written that hypertension in these communities is a normal response to ""chronic arousal"" (or stress). In small pre",When blood pressure is political,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/when-blood-pressure-is-political,"For example, when blood pressure drops acutely, the heart speeds up and the kidneys retain sodium and water, propelling blood pressure back to normal.
For instance, blood pressure often fluctuates from minute to minute.
Blood pressure also increases steadily throughout childhood and adulthood.
These in turn lead to long-term changes, like arterial wall thickening, that increase the blood pressure set point.
As an example of such arousal, Dr Sterling notes that blood pressure is often constant till about age six, but then it rises quickly as children detach from their parents and have to become vigilant against real or perceived threats.","pressure, communities, body, chronic, allostasis, homeostasis, political, blood, hypertension, stress, social",Severe weather disruptions

However, Mr Heng continues to raise his voice at the pair, telling them: ""Don't make your problem to be my problem.""

He tells the pair that they are ""kicking up a fuss"", and also says he has a recording of the incident.

On Saturday afternoon, Mr Heng posted a statement on Facebook, in which he said he has ""nothing against the elderly, especially the poor and the aged"".

He claimed that, shortly after picking the pair up, he discovered there was a discrepancy in the price displayed on his app and the fare they were told to pay.

Mr Heng said that his male passenger had ""suddenly gotten irritated"" and insisted that he alight.

Mr Heng added that after driving to a small road where he could stop his vehicle and allow the couple to call Gojek and alight, he told them that he would be recording the incident in case he was accused of overcharging them.

He wrote: ""I cannot afford to lose this job. I've mouths to feed. (I behaved) in such a manner because I was accused of overcharging the passenger. I did not. It is the system.

""I am just trying to hit my incentives, as the fares are already low. The pressure is immense. The terms are challenging. I'm facing a lot of stress to meet the targets.""

Mr Heng then apologised for his behaviour, stating that he was ""unnecessarily rude"", ""not respectful"" and did not explain himself clearly.

""I pray for a chance to make good,"" he wrote.

Mr Heng's Facebook profile and post have been deleted.

About four hours before writing his apology post, Mr Heng had lodged a police report on the incident.

In a copy of the report, which was uploaded on Facebook page SG Road Vigilante, Mr Heng said he had sent the video to a Whatsapp group chat to ask for advice on the situation.

He named the people in the group chat and asked the police to look into the matter and advise him on the actions he should take.

The moss rose plant needs to be grown under direct sunlight for best results. Do note that the flowers last only a day after they open. The flowers tend to wilt in the heat of the day or get damaged by heavy rain.

Check for mealy bugs, which are a common pest in this plant. They can set the plant back if left unchecked.

Deforestation and loss of peatlands, mangroves and grasslands for large-scale agriculture are degrading life-giving soils that humanity needs to feed and clothe itself, cutting yields, threatening food supplies for millions and raising the risk of mass migration.

Health and fitness bodies like the Health Promotion Board recommend 150 minutes of physical activity a week, to stay in optimal health.

How on earth is a sedentary person going to achieve that, you ask?

The good news: Lifestyle activities count too. If you move often enough, you may not even need a workout routine to clock those 150 minutes.

DO IT

Break it down, and you'll find that 150 minutes a week works out to about 20 minutes a day. Not too bad, isn't it? Just think about adding more steps to your daily life.

Ditch the bus to walk, the lift for stairs, the robotic vacuum cleaner for manual sweeping and mopping. Instead of bumming on the couch at night, go for a walk in the park.

To keep tabs on your progress, wear a fitness tracker to log your daily steps, distance covered and calories burned. You'll be motivated to do more and more when you see those stats.

2 Hit the gym more often

How often you visit the gym after joining is a strong predictor of your future attendance.

Some researchers say that habits need 21 days to be cultivated. So if your last visit was one month ago, chances are high that you won't be going back to the gym.

Work stress, family commitments and personal health play a big part in influencing your decision to exercise. Knowing yourself and what motivates you will go a long way.

DO IT

If you're more of a lone ranger, you're better off exercising at home, or a simple gym with equipment.

If you like sweating in a group and receiving instructions, group fitness classes like these will energise you.

Before committing to a gym, consider if it's near your home or workplace, and has the facilities that meet your needs.

However, when mutated, it loses its ability to prevent cancer formation. In fact, it turns on the body by promoting cancer cell survival and hindering cancer treatment.

498,07/2017,"""Local organic milk is the best, with a maximum transportation distance of 30km,"" he said, explaining that the farther the milk source is located, the less balanced its fermentation will be.

When facing difficulties securing fresh milk, such as in Bali, the closest material that can be used is pasteurized milk.

The second crucial ingredient is kefir, a cheese culture medium to be mixed with milk. Add kefir to 1 litre of milk, cover the mixture with cloth and leave it for 24 hours at room temperature. Before further processing, strain it with a plastic tea sieve to produce kefir milk and new kefir grains for further cheesemaking.

Ten liters of milk are needed to make about 1kg of cheese. In the demo class in Denpasar, Jamie processed 4 litres of milk that was only mixed with 60 millilitres of kefir milk. Any amount of kefir milk left can be consumed, which is good for cell regeneration and stabilising blood sugar levels.

The next step is to cook the blend of milk and kefir milk by warming it on a stove with a temperature increase of around 1 deg C every five minutes until it reaches 32 degrees, as shown on a thermometer immersed in the milk being stirred slowly. Heating it too fast will cause coagulation.

The third ingredient is the enzyme rennet, the only ingredient still imported as production requires special laboratory equipment.

They should be cooked to a golden yellow colour at most, as browning them produces acrylamide, a chemical which forms in certain foods when temperatures go above 120 degrees Celsius.
Its campaign, however, has drawn flak for not being able to scientifically prove that there was a link to cancer.

Iskandar was found guilty in December 2015 of murdering the two men on July 10, 2013, at the older man's Hillside Drive house in Kovan.

Iskandar, who was facing imminent bankruptcy, said during his trial that his plan had been simply to rob the car workshop owner, but the victim attacked him with a knife when he realised Iskandar was up to no good.

The son then arrived at the house and, seeing his father's body on the floor, charged and threw a punch at Iskandar, who retaliated.

The older victim suffered 27 stab and slash wounds, and died from a slit throat. His son, who was dragged for nearly 1km under his father's car which Iskandar had stolen to get away, was found with 20 knife wounds, and died from one to the neck. Iskandar had relatively minor injuries on his hands.

But the sea is free and thousands pack sandy beaches daily to escape the withering summer heat, erecting tents and preparing barbecues.
Gazans can also travel back in time for some leisure - to a Hammam, or bathhouse, believed to be more than 1,000 years old.
Several posh beachfront hotels and restaurants cater to Gaza's middle- and upper-class population, with some meals priced at up to 90 shekels.
Local residents say squabbles between Hamas and the Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are responsible for the irregular supply.","lifes, warweary, shekels, hamas, restaurants, gazas, health, place, war, number, beach, gaza, gazans, palestinian",Severe weather disruptions

CHOOSE THE RIGHT SPECIES

Many species of plants can be grown as bonsai. But some are hardier than others, given Singapore's tropical climate. For example, wrightia plants are tropical and come mainly from Malaysia. They are well suited to hot and humid weather.

Never buy maples ",Guide to bonsai,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/home-design/guide-to-bonsai,"Mr Jack Lee, 41, director of Bonsai Gallery, has these tips for those who want to start cultivating bonsai.
GIVE BONSAI ENOUGH SUNLIGHTIn general, bonsai are outdoor plants and do not cope well indoors.
If you must keep a bonsai indoors, use a grow light for 10 hours a day.
ROTATE BONSAI EVERY TWO WEEKSIf your bonsai plant gets sunlight from only one direction, rotate it to make sure the other side of the plant gets an equal amount of sunlight so that it will look even.
REPOT BONSAI EVERY TWO YEARSThe plant uses minerals from the soil to grow and these minerals get depleted within two years.","times, branches, soil, indoors, plant, minerals, tropical, bonsai, water, species, straits, plants",Severe weather disruptions
548,06/2016,"In the past, Mr Gan Chee Meng dealt simply with lines and angles in 2D drafting software. Now, as a BIM manager at Shimizu, he grapples with more dimensions.

BIM models are not just 3D drawings. Instead, they are created element by element: a specific size of prefab wall here, a door from a particular manufacturer there. A draughtsman must now incorporate all sorts of data into their model, from warranty details to the contact number of a manufacturer.

Further up the timeline, architects have had to become more precise as well, says RSP Architects Planners and Engineers director Vivien Heng: ""We've had to now do very clear designs upfront and go much deeper into our designs.""

Previously, an architect could draw a facade lattice, say, without worrying too much about structure. But BIM requires them to think about how the struts fit together, creating a model that structural engineers can use to calculate the forces and stresses involved.

""It's a lot of extra work,"" Ms Heng sums up.

Yet a data",Luring locals back into construction,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/luring-locals-back-into-construction,"DO OR DIEDigital tools are not just a ""nice-to-have option"", says Building and Construction Authority (BCA) chief executive John Keung.
The lean, waste-reducing approach that BIM and other digital technologies make possible is what Singapore's construction industry needs to survive, he argues.
In Singapore's construction sector, getting by with fewer workers is precisely the point.
As source countries such as China develop, fewer foreign workers - on which the construction industry depends - will come here.

549,01/2016,"Mr Fraguada, who has worked as an acrobat in shows such as Cirque du Soleil, used to struggle with managing his diabetes and hypoglycaemia. ""Many factors influence sugar levels in the blood; from stress to physical activity,"" he said.

Seven years ago, a first aider told him about dogs for diabetic people. He was in the United States at the time, where training programmes for such dogs have been in existence for many years.

That was how he started searching for a service dog. He attended courses in the US and he is now a trainer of lifesaving dogs.

He trained his german shepherd who has warned him of changes in his sugar levels, night and day, for the last four years.

""I trained Izzy to alert me when sugar leaves a determined safety range,"" he said.

Izzy often senses the change before it is detected by the glycaemia measuring machine. ""Sometimes he starts barking 20 minutes before the sugar begins to drop or rise alarmingly.""

This gives him the time to rebalance his blood sugar levels, either by having something sweet or injecting insulin.

Such dogs are trained to recognise a specific smell, undetectable by humans, which signals a change in blood sugar levels.

In Switzerland, Mr Fraguada is helping several families with diabetic children and adults find and train service dogs.

But not all dogs can do that. ""The dogs must have a very sensitive nose, and it takes between six and 18 months to train them,"" said Mr Fraguada.

""But the master must be trained as well. The bond between the two is very important. My dog, for example, follows me everywhere, even in the plane.""
