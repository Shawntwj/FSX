0,One billion people to face deadly heat stress if world warms 2 deg C,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/one-billion-people-to-face-deadly-heat-stress-if-world-warms-2-deg-c,"GLASGOW (BLOOMBERG) - One billion people will be at risk of extreme heat stress if global warming causes the world's temperature to rise by 2 deg Celsius, new modeling shows.
A study by the Met Office, the United Kingdom's's national meteorological service, warned that a 2 deg C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet.
A 4 deg C rise would mean that nearly half of the world's population could be living in affected areas, according to the research, released at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The Met Office used an indicator which combines warmth and humidity, known as wet-bulb temperature, to assess heat stress risk.
Limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C is a key goal of this year's climate talks, where ""keeping 1.5 alive"" has become an unofficial motto.","heat, deadly, impacts, warming, c, face, met, temperature, deg, world, risk, warms, climate, billion, rise, stress"

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also stressed the need for wage hikes to accompany any pick-up in inflation.
Some local media and opposition lawmakers have warned Japan may be experiencing ""bad"" inflation - driven by higher input costs and a weak yen - instead of ""good"" inflation backed by strong demand and wage growth.
The Premier said it was hard to draw a line on what constituted ""good"" or ""bad"" inflation, and declined to say when Japan could achieve the type of inflation considered desirable.
Japan has not been immune to the impact of global commodity inflation, with wholesale prices rising at a record pace, prodding more firms to raise prices and already shifting public perception that decades of weak inflation will persist.","heat, policymakers, wages, face, prices, talks, inflation, rising, mr, companies, kicks, bad, wage, cent, japan, weak"
3,"Extreme heat is a clear and growing health issue, two studies find",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/extreme-heat-is-a-clear-and-growing-health-issue-two-studies-find,"WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - More than 356,000 people died in 2019 as a result of extreme heat and that number is likely to grow, according to a study published in The Lancet this week.
The findings echo another report, a two-part series called Heat And Health that was also published in The Lancet this week.
Otherwise, deaths will increase further and extreme heat will also lessen worker productivity and exacerbate other environmental challenges, such as wildfires, researchers said.
""The effects extreme heat exposure can have on the body present a clear and growing global health issue,"" said Dr Ollie Jay, a professor from the University of Sydney, and a co-author of the Heat and Health report.

6,Pristine coral reef unblemished by warming oceans found off Tahiti,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/pristine-coral-reef-unblemished-by-warming-oceans-found-off-tahiti,"PARIS (REUTERS) - Scientists have discovered a pristine, 3km long reef of giant rose-shaped corals off the coast of Tahiti, in waters thought to be deep enough to protect it from the bleaching effects of the warming ocean.
Some of the rose-shaped corals measure more than 2m in diameter.
Most of the world's known coral reefs are in warmer waters at depths of up to 25m, Unesco said.
The reef off Tahiti lies in the ""twilight zone"" 30m to 120m below the surface where there is still enough light for coral to grow and reproduce.

Lead author Terry Hughes, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said the frequency, intensity and scale of climate-fuelled marine heatwaves that cause coral bleaching are increasing.
Bleaching occurs when healthy corals become stressed by spikes in ocean temperatures, causing them to expel algae living in their tissues which drains them of their vibrant colours.
The Great Barrier Reef has suffered three mass bleaching events during heatwaves in 2016, 2017 and 2020, leaving many affected corals struggling to survive.
The reef is also susceptible to harm from cyclones and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat the coral, with both factors becoming more damaging due to climate change.","study, impacts, coral, great, bleaching, corals, reefs, reef, mass, barrier, climate, 98, shows, heatwaves, cent"

Countries came to the United Nations-led negotiations with their latest national emissions-cutting pledges - known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs - placing earth on course to warm 2.7 deg C this century.
Experts say these and other pledges could have a significant effect on temperature rises.

Those most threatened will be outdoor workers in already-hot countries where temperatures and humidity are rising fast, possibly threatening the economic lifeline of South Asian migrants seeking jobs in Gulf nations.
It warned that the sum would grow more than fivefold if the planet gets 2 deg C hotter than now, on top of the 1.1 deg C of warming already seen since pre-industrial times.
""More global labour will be lost in the coolest half of the day than is currently lost in the hottest half of the day,"" said study co-author Luke Parsons of North Carolina's Duke University.

Justice Choo Han Teck , who is also president of the Military Court of Appeal, said that in theory, morale and discipline are straightforward concepts and should have no separate meanings in times of peace and in times of war or conflict.
His remarks were made last month in a speech - titled Ensuring Fair Court Procedures For Commonwealth Militaries: A Collective Responsibility - at a virtual conference held by the Commonwealth Magistrates' and Judges' Association.

In September, the Taskforce on Family Violence released a report with 16 recommendations after examining more than 3,600 family violence cases and conducting focus group discussions with those involved in the work, among other efforts.
The recommendations are meant to make it easier for victims of family violence to get help and better protect themselves against their abusers.

Its stress test examined how 48 economies would be impacted by the effects of climate change under four different temperature increase scenarios.
As global warming makes the impact of weather-related natural disasters more severe, it can lead to substantial income and productivity losses over time, it said.
For example, rising sea levels result in loss of land that could have otherwise been used productively and heat stress can lead to crop failures.

32,From skin thinning to temporary results: Common facial laser treatment myths debunked,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/sl-aesthetic-clinic-pico-laser-common-myths,"He explains that this laser treatment is able to ""break melanin and stimulate collagen remodelling to reduce pigmentation, thus creating a more even skin tone and brighter skin"".
The Pico Laser works by blasting short bursts of laser energy (the ""pico"" refers to picosecond, which is 1/1000 of a nanosecond or one trillionth of a second) into the affected areas.
It is this speed that makes the Pico Laser more efficient when dealing with pigmentation, as compared to conventional Nd:YAG nanosecond lasers.
But more importantly, the Pico Laser requires less downtime, so you can zip in and out, and continue with your day, with no one being the wiser.

Of those cases, it is possible some may turn out to be psychosomatic, according to people briefed on the intelligence.
But, so far, the CIA has been unable to collect hard evidence to show that any of the people suffering from symptoms of Havana syndrome have been hit with some sort of energy pulse.

Around 60 people share North Ronaldsay - an island just over 5 kilometres long, ringed by rocky beaches and turquoise waters off the north coast of mainland Britain - with the distinctive native sheep.
The unintended result: in summer the sheep can nibble on grass, but by winter eating the plentiful seaweed is their only means of survival.
Farm animals belch and fart methane gas which, though trivial sounding, is about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.
