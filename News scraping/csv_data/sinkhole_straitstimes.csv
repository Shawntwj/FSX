Kelihos is alleged to have sold the network's services to others, who would use them to send out spam e-mails advertising counterfeit drugs, work-at-home scams and other fraud schemes, the indictment said.
For legal ads, he charged US$200 (S$280) per million spam e-mails.

Each year, after the first spring rains, the crabs march for days from the surrounding forests to the bay on Cuba's southern coast to spawn in the sea, wreaking havoc along the way.
The Bay of Pigs, where in 1961 Cuban exiles landed in a failed attempt to end Fidel Castro's revolution, lies within a national park where 80 per cent of Cuba's endemic birds, along with crocodiles and other wildlife, can be observed.
With its deep sinkholes, coral reefs and turquoise waters, the bay is known as one of Cuba's best spots for diving.
At the Bay of Pigs, the adult crabs return to their forest burrows after releasing clouds of eggs and are joined a couple of months later by the baby crabs which hatched at sea, said Jimenez.","endemic, road, bay, crabs, pigs, sea, crab, cuba, cubas, invade, repair",natural calamities

The losers are not contesting the verdict and have accepted it with grace, although some protests are visible at grassroots level in some cities. For his part, Mr Donald Trump, who had earlier threatened to jail his Democratic rival if elected, has heaped praise on her for her determination during the race and for her long record of public service. These are positive beginnings because the rifts that have opened in the past months are not mere cracks but potentially major sinkholes in the country's national fabric.

Mr Trump, shortly after claiming victory, said he would rule as a president for all Americans, and he must. He has contributed much to the national polarisation during the past year. Taking jabs at veterans, threatening to wall off America against Mexicans and Muslims, dissing longstanding trade agreements and putative ones, Mr Trump played to the deepest insecurities of Americans. A cynical interpretation is that the billionaire rode the poor man's pony to the top by exploiting populist anger over threats to livelihood, identity and security. The voters he energised with his dire warnings apparently seemed more eager to vote, especially in the states that mattered. Many others simply stayed away.

The politics of fear won big, riding on America's electoral system. Even if Mrs Hillary Clinton won a slight majority of the popular vote (as indicated towards the end of counting), Mr Trump's message appealed to a sizeable section of the population.
