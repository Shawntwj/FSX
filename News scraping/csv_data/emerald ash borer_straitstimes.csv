0,08/2021,SINGAPORE ,Check in and check out these S'pore hotels that got a pandemic makeover,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/travel/check-in-and-check-out-these-spore-hotels-that-got-a-pandemic-makeover,"SINGAPORE - The global pandemic has created a pocket of downtime for hotels to refurbish and rebrand while occupancy is still low.
At recently revamped hotels such as Capella Singapore and a trio of Pan Pacific Hotels Group properties, the new looks - alongside novel experiences planned by the hotels - entice staycationers.
And when international tourists return, hoteliers hope the redesigned properties will be a fresh encounter for them.
""Without international tourism, there is less impact on operations and guest experiences since our hotels are operating at low occupancy.""
While the pandemic has delayed the transformation timeline for some hotels, the upgrading works are also less disruptive.","pandemic, singapore, properties, check, low, members, hotels, tourism, international, hotel, tourists, spore, makeover",Pest and disease outbreaks

Here is why: At a time when climate change is making heat waves more frequent and more severe, trees are stationary superheroes.
So, in Des Moines, Mr McQuillan worked with the property owners and city planners to find a way to redevelop while keeping the trees.
Mr McQuillan raced to the site, just a couple blocks from his office.

2,06/2021,BANGKOK (NYTIMES) ,"After lavish nights of clubbing in Bangkok, a Covid-19 outbreak",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/after-lavish-nights-of-clubbing-in-bangkok-a-covid-19-outbreak,"BANGKOK (NYTIMES) - When the VVIP customers disembarked from their limousines at the Krystal Exclusive Club, young women in tiaras, angel wings and not much else sometimes greeted them.
The VVIP clientele were whisked to the VVIP rooms, with their padded walls and plush sofas.
For all the mask-wearing rigour and lockdown obedience displayed by many Thais, the abandon of a privileged few catalysed Bangkok's latest coronavirus outbreak, health officials said.
Thailand is counting on local production this summer of the AstraZeneca vaccine by a company controlled by the country's king.
Ms Supatra's boyfriend, who also developed Covid-19, is still in the hospital.","lavish, ms, nights, vvip, vaccines, covid19, day, rich, bangkok, outbreak, coronavirus, infected, clubbing, health, krystal, thailand",Pest and disease outbreaks
3,10/2020,SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) ,Singapore retail rents may bottom out by early 2021; Orchard malls leading decline: Knight Frank,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/singapore-retail-rents-may-bottom-out-by-early-2021-orchard-malls-leading-decline,"Overall retail rents are expected to fall by 10-15 per cent for the whole of this year due to recessionary pressures and safe-distancing restrictions, according to the real estate consultancy.
That being said, in the suburban region, rents of retailers will likely decline by just 7.5 per cent or less.
Suburban retail rents are expected to recover sooner because they are supported by the domestic catchment resident population.
Prime spaces refer to rental-yielding units between 350 and 1,500 square feet with the best frontage, connectivity, footfall and accessibility in a mall.
Propping up the retail market were the suburban areas, where rents started to stabilise during the July-September period.","malls, decline, singapore, early, knight, psf, retail, cent, rents, suburban, orchard, mall, tourists, prime, frank, spaces, leading",Pest and disease outbreaks

A major art fair in Hong Kong was called off, and important spring art auctions half a world away in New York have been postponed because well-heeled Chinese buyers may find it difficult to travel to them.
China was the third-biggest art market in the world in 2018, according to last year's Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report, accounting for 19 per cent of the US$67 billion spent on art that year.
Last week, Art Basel Hong Kong, an annual art fair scheduled for mid-March, was cancelled, depriving dealers and artists of a major opportunity to show works to customers based in China and beyond.
Galleries that had planned to exhibit at Art Basel Hong Kong were offered a refund of 75 per cent of their booth fees, which run to US$125,000 for the largest spaces.","postponed, grip, tightens, art, kong, fair, world, squeeze, coronavirus, china, cent, feels, hong, million, market",Pest and disease outbreaks
