The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oil seeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.2 points last month, down 4.3 per cent on February.
The FAO's sugar price index posted the biggest fall, down 19.1 per cent from the previous month.
The drop was triggered by a reduction in consumption linked to the virus lockdowns seen in many countries, and lower demand from ethanol producers due to the recent dive in crude oil prices, the Rome-based agency said.
The vegetable oil price index slumped 12 per cent, pushed down by sliding palm oil prices, which was linked to a plunge in crude mineral oil prices and growing uncertainty over the impact of coronavirus on the market.","vegetable, cent, food, coronavirus, world, prices, fall, index, sharply, demand, sugar, oil, price, slump, fao",Pandemic

32,Jan-18,"Mr Jimmy Quek, chairman of the Singapore Tropical Fruits Importers and Exporters Association, said the cold weather caused faster decay in harvested crops and a much shorter shelf life.

""As a result, we have seen a 20 per cent drop in fruit sales overall,"" he said.

Mr Quek said mandarin orange prices are expected to go up by 10 per cent to 30 per cent during the Chinese New Year period because flood waters have affected harvests.

""At this point, prices are stable, but by next month, consumers will feel the shortage,"" he said.

To ensure they have enough supplies, retailers such as Sheng Siong, FairPrice, Giant and Cold Storage have sourced crops from China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and from countries as far away as Ecuador and Mexico.

Both Mr Quek and Mr Lee said wholesalers will be the ones to absorb the extra costs and ride out the price increase, while also looking to more sources for their crops to keep prices stable for retailers and consumers.

A check with small fruit stalls across the island showed that merchants were largely not increasing prices.

Mr Zhao Win Son, 51, a durian stall owner at Block 260, Serangoon Central Drive, said he kept prices at $15 to $21 per kg even though his supply of durians from Malaysia fell by 20 per cent to 30 per cent over the weekend. This was because flooded roads prevented trucks from moving off.

In Bukit Ho Swee, fruit stall owner Christine Goh said strong winds caused durians to drop before they are fully ripe, which also means the fruit is smaller and less sweet.

She has raised prices slightly to $13 to $14 per kg from $11 to $12.

Most people The Straits Times spoke to on Monday (Jan 15) said there was no noticeable increase in vegetable prices either at wet markets or supermarkets.

However, a housewife who wanted to be known only as Mrs Lee, said chye sim and xiao bai cai cost about 20 cents more at the wet market she frequents. But she was not sure if the vegetables are from Malaysia","More durians imported into Singapore so far this year than same period in 2017

""We expect our sales in October and November to go down to between RM180,000 and RM200,000,'' he said adding that even the size of the fruits were also smaller because of the haze.

Omar said this year's haze, which had prolonged for almost 35 days, was the worst compared with last year's which lasted less than a month.

According to Dr Mohd Norowi Hamid, who is the director of Agrobiodiversity and Environment Research Centre in Mardi, the haze reduced the photosynthesis rate because less sunlight reached the plants.

He cited the case that occurred in Serdang during 2013 when a 50 per cent s reduction in sunlight caused a 40 per cent lower photosynthesis rate in the corn plants. This in turn had reduced the yield.
