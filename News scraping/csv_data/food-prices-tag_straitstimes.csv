A global index released on Thursday (Feb 3) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation showed that food prices in January climbed to their highest level since 2011, when skyrocketing costs contributed to political uprisings in Egypt and Libya.
Even before the pandemic, global food prices had been trending upwards as disease wiped out much of China's pig herd and the United States-China trade war resulted in Chinese tariffs on US agricultural goods.
But as the pandemic began in early 2020, the world experienced seismic shifts in demand for food.
While food prices appear set to stabilise, events like a conflict in Ukraine, a major producer of wheat and corn, or further adverse weather could change that calculation, Mr Bogmans said.","hit, price, cent, food, world, 2decade, prices, threatening, worlds, high, weather, supply, global, increases, poorest, pandemic"

That's because they question whether the US would really be able to ship all of the US$15 billion (S$20.4 billion) in potential federal farm-good purchases as humanitarian aid to poor countries.
The purchases were through the Commodity Credit Corporation - an entity established in 1933 to stabilise, support and protect farm income as well as prices.
In the 1980s, crops expanded just as the export ban caused Soviet Union countries to start buying grain elsewhere.
At the time, growers could deliver supplies to the Commodity Credit Corporation below certain loan rates.","billion, credit, plan, farm, 80s, prices, us15, countries, traders, vu, sceptical, deja, aid, trumps, grain, union, corporation, 1980s, commodity"

The viral disease, first reported in China in August, has infected swine across the nation, as well as Mongolia, Vietnam and Cambodia.
Just last week, they reported to him that African swine fever is ""spreading just as badly as it has been, and is continuing to get worse"", he said.

According to the latest figures from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), 8,900 tonnes of fresh and chilled durians were imported into Singapore, more than the amount recorded at the halfway point last year when a total of 14,300 tonnes were imported for the whole of 2017.
Of the number of durians imported so far this year, 8,300 tonnes came from Malaysia and 600 tonnes from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and other countries.
According to Shin Min Daily News, 8,900 tonnes of durian is equivalent to about 6 million durians, if one fruit weighs 1.5kg.
This year, not only is there an abundance of the fruit but the quality of the durians is also better, said durian lovers.","fruit, number, 2017, far, 8900, durians, singapore, malaysia, halfway, durian, tonnes, imported, period"
61,01/2018,"Mr Jimmy Quek, chairman of the Singapore Tropical Fruits Importers and Exporters Association, said the cold weather caused faster decay in harvested crops and a much shorter shelf life.

""As a result, we have seen a 20 per cent drop in fruit sales overall,"" he said.

Mr Quek said mandarin orange prices are expected to go up by 10 per cent to 30 per cent during the Chinese New Year period because flood waters have affected harvests.

""At this point, prices are stable, but by next month, consumers will feel the shortage,"" he said.

To ensure they have enough supplies, retailers such as Sheng Siong, FairPrice, Giant and Cold Storage have sourced crops from China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and from countries as far away as Ecuador and Mexico.

Both Mr Quek and Mr Lee said wholesalers will be the ones to absorb the extra costs and ride out the price increase, while also looking to more sources for their crops to keep prices stable for retailers and consumers.

A check with small fruit stalls across the island showed that merchants were largely not increasing prices.

Mr Zhao Win Son, 51, a durian stall owner at Block 260, Serangoon Central Drive, said he kept prices at $15 to $21 per kg even though his supply of durians from Malaysia fell by 20 per cent to 30 per cent over the weekend. This was because flooded roads prevented trucks from moving off.

In Bukit Ho Swee, fruit stall owner Christine Goh said strong winds caused durians to drop before they are fully ripe, which also means the fruit is smaller and less sweet.

She has raised prices slightly to $13 to $14 per kg from $11 to $12.

Most people The Straits Times spoke to on Monday (Jan 15) said there was no noticeable increase in vegetable prices either at wet markets or supermarkets.

However, a housewife who wanted to be known only as Mrs Lee, said chye sim and xiao bai cai cost about 20 cents more at the wet market she frequents. But she was not sure if the vegetables are from Malaysia","More durians imported into Singapore so far this year than same period in 2017

Brazil's mills can choose to divert their cane to production of ethanol for the domestic fuel market or sugar for export.

""We expect our sales in October and November to go down to between RM180,000 and RM200,000,'' he said adding that even the size of the fruits were also smaller because of the haze.

Omar said this year's haze, which had prolonged for almost 35 days, was the worst compared with last year's which lasted less than a month.

According to Dr Mohd Norowi Hamid, who is the director of Agrobiodiversity and Environment Research Centre in Mardi, the haze reduced the photosynthesis rate because less sunlight reached the plants.

He cited the case that occurred in Serdang during 2013 when a 50 per cent s reduction in sunlight caused a 40 per cent lower photosynthesis rate in the corn plants. This in turn had reduced the yield.

The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) said its food price index declined 1.9 per cent in January to 182.7 points, due to ""robust inventories, continued strength in the US dollar and weak crude oil prices.""
Food prices have now fallen back to the levels of five years ago, but on a real basis are still about 20 per cent higher than in the 2000s.
Global crude oil prices have fallen by about half since June, and lower fuel costs should reduce farmers' production costs, as well as expenses to ship food.
The FAO's Food Price Index is a trade-weighted index that tracks prices of five major food commodity groups on international markets.","cent, reduce, food, prices, production, index, helping, oil, fallen, price, low, lower, fao"
