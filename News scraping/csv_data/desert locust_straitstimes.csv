0,05/2020,"India is bracing itself for a growing assault on its western front, with droves of intruders flying in from Pakistan.

While the first reports of the current cycle of desert locusts came last month, swarms of these voracious insects have grown significantly in recent weeks, making inroads deep into the country and posing a threat to crops as well as vegetation used for animal fodder.

The fresh outbreak has been severe in Rajasthan, a state bordering Pakistan. Locusts have been spotted in more than 17 districts there, including some where they have never been reported before.

India's previous cycle of attacks by desert locusts lasted from May last year to this February, causing reported damage across 371,000ha, totalling 10 billion rupees (S$187.7 million), in Rajasthan alone.

Not only has the new cycle of attack come earlier than expected, the locusts have also spread wider in search of food given the lower availability of vegetation in summer months. Sightings have been reported in the states of Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.

Last year, the pests destroyed about 2,500ha in what was then described as the worst outbreak since the end of World War II.
