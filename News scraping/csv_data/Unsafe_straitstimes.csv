Similarly, those riding electric bicycles think they have the right to travel on main roads. They whisk around, competing with motorists, and endanger themselves and other road users.

As a motorist and pedestrian, I have encountered several unpleasant experiences and seen a few accidents where people were hurt after being hit by speeding PMDs.

We can educate the majority to abide by the rules, but all it takes is a few black sheep to frighten pedestrians, particularly the frail and the elderly.

Brainstorming how to empower the workforce to speak up and avoid working in an unsafe environment is the first thing companies should do in a workplace psychological safety programme.","safe, speak, unsafe, concerns, safety, forum, empower, staff, team, workplace, questions, psychologically, psychological, speaking, freely",Food safety/contamination

On Monday (Nov 22), District Judge John Ng granted Mr Sreekamal Asante Parambil Kalesan, now 46, a discharge amounting to an acquittal.
This means Mr Sreekamal, who was represented by lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan from Kalidass Law Corporation, cannot be charged again with the same offence.
The judge went on to say that the outcome of the case depended on the assessment of the credibility of the complainant and Mr Sreekamal.
Judge Ng said it was unsafe to convict Mr Sreekamal, noting that the girl had difficulty recalling what had happened when she was hypnotised during the session.","teen, noted, judge, complainant, sreekamal, girl, mr, victim, evidence, accused, session, man, defence, acquitted, molesting, hypnotherapy",Food safety/contamination

The authorities were considering the response on Sunday, but airlines and regulators predicted substantial impact on flight schedules if there aren't some adjustments to the 5G service set to start on Jan 5.
The wireless industry said power levels are low enough to preclude interference, and the gap between frequencies is sufficiently large to ensure safety.
Some type of restriction on 5G service near runways could limit impacts and give industry groups and regulators more time to study the potential for interference.

The settlement would also require Boeing to provide annual public reports on safety related enhancements implemented by the plane maker since the Max air disasters.
Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice in January including US$2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes.

The world's automakers are investing in facilities to salvage old parts, but the industry is also looking to recycle the millions of electric batteries used for the cars of the future.
While electric cars are cleaner than their fossil fuel forebears, the raw materials needed for their batteries are extracted from mines in Africa that are often accused of environmental damage and using child labour.
Batteries can account for as much as half the price of electric cars, with a life expectancy ranging between eight and 15 years.

Each year, environmental risks such as indoor and outdoor pollution, second-hand smoke, unsafe water and poor sanitation kill around 1.7 million children between the ages of one month and five years, the reports found.
Harmful exposure can start in the mother's womb, increasing the risk of premature birth, which can lead to life-long health problems.
When children are exposed to air pollutants they also can face a lifelong increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases, like asthma, and of heart disease, stroke and cancer.
The findings were in line with a WHO study published last year showing that about a quarter of all deaths worldwide, across all age groups, were attributable to environmental factors like air, water and soil pollution, as well as unsafe roads and workplace stress.","million, water, environments, unsafe, kids, risk, reports, polluted, children, environmental, 17, pollution, lifelong, health, kill, published",Food safety/contamination

Cost is often cited as a reason why lorries are used as a transportation mode, but some companies are able to provide buses for migrant workers. Why is it that they are able to do so and others are unable to?

Is it because some companies, in trying to offer the lowest bid or to maximise profit, are willing to forgo basic safety?

Keeping costs down should not stop Singapore from doing the right thing. The Government should take action.

Back in 2010, owing to another accident that killed a few foreign workers, the Government imposed the requirement for all lorries used for ferrying workers to be fitted with canopies and higher railings.

The recent accidents show that these measures are no substitute for transport in enclosed vehicles, such as buses or minivans, where seat belts can be provided.

Singaporeans should not just show sympathy each time there is an accident, or when lives are lost.

These foreign workers are the backbone of Singapore's construction, marine shipyard and process sectors. They labour to improve the infrastructure and landscape of Singapore and help to keep the country going.

The least that can be done is to ensure that their safety is taken care of.

He argued that there was more than sufficient justification for the decision to prosecute Ms Parti.
This included the accounts from the Liews and Ms Parti's own admission that she had taken some items without consent.","ms, person, liyani, prosecute, parti, vexatious, mr, court, frivolous, compensation, seeks, partis, items, agc, prosecution",Food safety/contamination
193,Apr-21,SINGAPORE ,"askST: How concerned should we be about blood clots linked to AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines?",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-how-concerned-should-we-be-about-side-effects-of-the-astrazeneca-johnson,"Prof Hsu: This very rare side effect was discovered because a number of people who were vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine presented with blood clots in the cerebral venous sinuses, which are large veins straining blood from the brain.
Currently, the estimated figure is that about four per million first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will result in this very rare phenomenon.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine side effects have just been uncovered and it seems to be the same phenomenon, but the scientific reports are not out yet.
The risk seems to be even lower than the AstraZeneca vaccine by a small factor; I think it's one in a million Johnson & Johnson vaccines resulting in this condition.
Prof Hsu: When this reaction occurs, it is difficult to treat because the blood clots have already happened in critical parts of the body such as the brain or the lungs.","million, vaccines, astrazeneca, risk, askst, blood, concerned, johnson, rare, small, vaccine, effect, clots, covid19, linked",Food safety/contamination

About one in three of those who were harassed suffered at the hands of their boss or someone more senior than them in the office.

But only one in three victims reported the harassment to their boss, a senior person at work or their human resource department.

The study was carried out by market research firm Ipsos and gender equality organisation Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware).

A total of 1,000 Singaporeans and permanent residents, both working men and women, were polled online in November last year, Aware said in a statement yesterday.

Of those who said they were sexually harassed at work, 18 per cent said they received crude and distressing remarks, jokes or gestures of a sexual or sexist nature.

Another 16 per cent heard offensive or alarming remarks or questions about their body, appearance or sexual activities, while some 13 per cent were physically touched in an unwelcome way.

But only one in three reported the harassment to an official authority at work.

Those who did not said they wanted to forget the unpleasant experience or felt what they had experienced was not serious enough. Some also felt they had no evidence of the wrongdoing.

In about 40 per cent of the harassment cases reported by the victims to their management, the perpetrator was reassigned to another job role or sacked.

However, in about 20 per cent of the cases, the harasser faced no consequence despite evidence of the offence.

He has given the US Congress days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions that had been lifted on Iran and said that he may seek to terminate the deal.
If the US' actions lead to Iran resuming its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, it will plunge the Middle East into an arms race, and make the unstable situation in the region even more chaotic.

GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT

Walk through a construction site and a barrage of hazards stands out even to the untrained eye.

Sharp lengths of metal protrude across paths. Workers pick their way among them, some in slippers, some checking their phones. Overhead, their colleagues clamber up and down scaffolding. Not all wear harnesses. Not all of those with harnesses have lifelines to hook onto.

Falls from height remain the most common cause of workplace death here, with 11 such deaths in the first half of the year.

Workers have died from other factors too ","Workplace safety in Singapore: 55 deaths, and all 'were preventable'",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/55-deaths-and-all-were-preventable,"Falls from height remain the most common cause of workplace death here, with 11 such deaths in the first half of the year.
The Workplace Safety and Health Institute (WSHI) last month released a study on the beleaguered construction sector.
The Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) this June launched an Awareness Booster Campaign, with pictogram posters teaching workers how to prevent injuries.
The WSHI study on construction deaths also showed that nearly nine in 10 were due to companies failing to adequately manage risks.

""China will fully and solemnly assess this matter, and will take a series of necessary measures to safeguard Chinese companies' legitimate rights and interests,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said at a routine briefing.

""Any decisions and actions (by Britain) must come at a cost,"" Ms Hua said, without elaborating.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said yesterday that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese companies like Huawei, which he accused of facilitating human rights violations.

He also said telecommunications companies around the world ""should consider themselves on notice"" that if they do business with Huawei, ""they are doing business with human rights abusers"".

Mr Pompeo told a news conference that the US State Department would ""impose visa restrictions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally"".

Mr Pompeo also said that ""faster is always better"" in terms of getting Huawei out of telecommunications infrastructure, when asked about British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's order that Huawei equipment be purged completely from Britain's 5G network by the end of 2027.

In a separate statement referring to alleged abuses against China's minority Muslim population, Mr Pompeo charged that Huawei was ""an arm of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China"".

On Tuesday, in comments likely to do Mr Johnson few favours as he navigates the spat with China, US President Donald Trump told reporters in Washington that he personally intervened in the British decision.

Qualifying for the year's first Grand Slam, beginning next Monday, started late owing to the hazy weather.

Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley, also director of the Australian Open, however, rejected the criticism, insisting ""an e-mail"" was sent.
While Tiley has continued to insist the Australian Open is unlikely to be delayed, regardless of the conditions, yesterday he conceded that ""this is a new experience for all of us in how we manage air quality"".","quality, breathing, players, open, melbourne, medical, qualifier, bush, australian, conditions, gets, heat",Food safety/contamination
461,Jan-20,"Taal has been on Alert 1 level since March last year, but the situation seemed stable until Sunday afternoon, with some seismic activity (volcanic earthquakes) detected, leading to a level 2 alert.

Taal erupted Monday at around 3 am, when an alert level 4 was raised. There is still a possibility that level 5 could be raised, meaning an even stronger eruption, but there is no way of telling if and when this will happen.

The Sunday eruption resulted in a huge plume reaching as high as 30 kilometres at one point. When the press conference was held, the plume was about 12.5 kilometres high.

In sharing this information, Dr Bagtasa's main point was that much of the fine ash was up there in the atmosphere, and that the plume was moving in a northeast direction, toward the Pacific and Okinawa.

The panic comes from the ash that ended up on our rooftops and vehicle windshields, but Dr Bagtasa pointed out these range from 50 to 170 µm (micrometers), tiny but still too large to be inhaled (please don't try).

For purposes of comparison, the diameter of hair is about 50 micrometers.

We should be more concerned about fine particulate matter; the one from Taal is mostly high up in the atmosphere.

In fact, UP Diliman's monitoring of air quality in Quezon City showed levels that were actually good on Monday, at about 10 µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter), below the World Health Organisation's unsafe threshold of 25 µg/m3.

Dr Bagtasa said that on Sunday night, the levels did reach 60, but had gone down after.

The WHO threshold, added Dr Bagtasa , is equivalent to one stick of a cigarette. The fireworks on New Year's eve, on the other hand, pushed air pollution levels to as high as 200 µ/m3!

In terms of hazards, the area around Taal and the southern Tagalog provinces do face the greatest risks in terms of pollution, and residents would do well to take precautions, especially in the case of children, the elderly and those with chronic conditions like asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.

But for Metro Manila, we should be more worried about the daily air pollution we get from vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, and even people smoking cigarettes.

In doing so, motorists who own luxury cars would pay a bigger fine for the same offence compared with those who drive cheaper vehicles, and this would make fines more meaningful as a deterrent, said Nominated MP Walter Theseira yesterday.

This would be a more practical way here than pegging fines to the income levels of errant motorists, he added, citing the example of a Finnish businessman who was fined €54,024 (S$82,400) for driving at 64 miles (103km) per hour in a 50 mile per hour zone.

558,Jun-19,"Border apprehensions hit their highest level in more than a decade in May, straining resources and creating chaotic scenes at overcrowded border patrol facilities.

Many of the migrants are either children or families, mostly from Central America.

""Children are suffering at the border and we must act now to stop it,"" Representative Ben McAdams wrote on Twitter.

Lawmakers in the House stood for a moment's silence on Thursday out of respect for migrants trying to cross to the United States.

The conditions of unaccompanied children crossing the border has become a key issue in the 2020 presidential race. During a debate on Wednesday night, many of the Democratic candidates called for an overhaul of US immigration laws and about 12 of them are set to visit a Florida facility this week.

A photo of Salvadoran father Oscar Alberto Martinez and his toddler daughter Angie Valeria who drowned attempting to cross the Rio Grande added urgency on both sides of the aisle to reach a funding deal.

'DEPLORABLE' CONDITIONS

Lawyers and human rights workers said they found sick and hungry children when they visited the Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas.

""Many had been detained for weeks, one even up to a month in really horrific conditions,"" said Clara Long, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Attorneys representing migrant children filed papers in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday asking that the US government be held in contempt of court for ""flagrant and persistent"" violations of the terms of a 1997 agreement that governs the treatment of children in immigration detention.

They requested immediate action be taken to remedy the ""deplorable""conditions.

The renewed focus on conditions on the border has also galvanised opposition in recent days to a Trump Administration policy that sends asylum seekers to some of Mexico's most violent cities.

In an open letter to Trump and other political leaders, a coalition of evangelical churches said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the policy which it said left children vulnerable to violence and trafficking, as well as by reports of ""inhumane"" conditions in US federal immigration facilities.

The Catholic diocese of El Paso, Texas, separately denounced a critical lack of shelter, food, legal aid and basic services for asylum seekers returned to Mexico under the programme and ""distressing detention conditions"" in the United States before they are returned.

In court papers filed on Wednesday, a union that represents asylum officers at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, described the program as ""fundamentally contrary to the moral fabric of our nation,"" citing the American tradition of sheltering the persecuted stretching back to the arrival of ""Pilgrims onto a Massachusetts shore in November 1620.",US Congress headed for border funding compromise as migrants kept in squalor,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-congress-headed-for-border-funding-compromise-as-migrants-kept-in-squalor,"Border apprehensions hit their highest level in more than a decade in May, straining resources and creating chaotic scenes at overcrowded border patrol facilities.

586,Jun-19,"MOSCOW • After years of increasing assertiveness by Russia's military in waters and airspace around its borders, a Russian destroyer nearly collided on Friday with a United States warship in the Philippine Sea.

Each side blamed the other for the episode, which took place in Asian waters that have previously been the site of an intense naval rivalry between the US and China, but from which Russia, though a Pacific power, had been largely absent.

Nato has repeatedly accused Russia's warplanes and warships of staging dangerous, threatening manoeuvres in the Baltic and Black seas, but the incident on Friday at around 11.45am was the first potentially catastrophic near miss involving Russian and US naval vessels so far from Russian shores since the end of the Cold War.

The US Navy's 7th Fleet, which patrols the Pacific, said the Russian destroyer's crew had navigated unsafely and forced the US warship into an avoidance manoeuvre. The Americans released video clips to corroborate their version of events.

The US Navy's 7th Fleet, which patrols the Pacific, said the Russian destroyer's crew had navigated unsafely and forced the US warship into an avoidance manoeuvre.
The Americans released video clips to corroborate their version of events.
Russian state-controlled media suggested that the near collision, the second close encounter involving United States and Russia forces last week, had been staged by the Pentagon to coincide with a visit to Russia by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has overseen a steady increase in economic and military ties between Beijing and Moscow.
China and Russia are not officially military allies, but they have staged joint military exercises and increasingly look to each other for leverage against Washington, with which both have severely strained relations.","blame, near, staged, pacific, sea, military, states, waters, russian, warship, miss, russia, russias, united, warships",Food safety/contamination

616,Apr-19,"It is time to outlaw using mobile phones while crossing roads (Woman crossing road while on phone hit by taxi, April 8).

In February, it was announced that fines for pedestrian and cyclist offences will be raised. For example, the fine for jaywalking was increased to $50 from $20.

However, there was no mention of the penalties for pedestrians using their mobile phones while crossing the road.

One wonders why there is such a heavy penalty for drivers using mobile phones while driving when those who use their phones while cycling, on a personal mobility device (PMD) or walking across the roads are not penalised for doing so.

Cognitive distraction from mobile phone use can reduce situational awareness and increase unsafe behaviour for pedestrians, PMD users and cyclists, just as it does for drivers.

Being distracted, whether one is a pedestrian or behind the wheel, can lead to accidents. While drivers are supposed to look out for any obstructions on the road, it is impossible for them to always be able to stop in time or in a safe manner to prevent an accident.

The authorities must act for the sake of everyone's safety and should consider ways to reduce such reckless behaviour through fines.

Japan's government has pushed hard to return affected areas to normal, but has faced criticism that what it refers to as ""safe"" radiation levels are not in line with international standards.
The Fukushima disaster was the worst since Chernobyl in 1986, though there has only been one death linked to it.","areas, disaster, returns, rejected, tuncak, rejects, japans, radiation, levels, stop, return, affected, japan, fukushima",Food safety/contamination

716,Aug-18,"Scientists have discovered a natural preservative that keeps food fresh for at least eight times longer than artificial preservatives, and at roughly the same cost.

It can be used on meats, fruit and juices, among other types of food vulnerable to bacterial infection, said Professor William Chen from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on Thursday.

The director of the university's food science and technology programme said the research team is already negotiating with commercial players and hopes to get its product in the market within two years.

The preservative is made from flavonoids, a group of naturally occurring substances found in almost all fruit and vegetables.

Prof Chen's team did not extract flavonoids directly from plants because it would entail the substances being processed in a way that would impact human hormone production. Rather, it used genetically modified yeast to produce the flavonoids.

Tests showed that meat and fruit juice treated with the natural preservative stayed fresh for two days at room temperature, while untreated samples grew bacteria within six hours, making the food unsafe for consumption.

Prof Chen estimated that $2 worth of flavonoids can treat 1,000 litres of fruit juice.

After seven decades in operation, the country's busiest international airport is no longer up to international standards.
The airport complex was meant to serve at most 31 million passengers a year; these days it strains under the tremendous load of 42 million passengers yearly, a figure projected to rise to 47 million by 2020.
At least two key members of President Duterte's Cabinet - Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III - recognize the need for a new international airport and the eventual decommissioning of Naia.

Also of concern to the pediatricians are perfluoroalkyl chemicals, or PFCs, used in grease-proof paper and packaging, and perchlorates, an anti-static agent used in plastic packaging.
Infants and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chemicals in food in part because they eat more food per pound of body weight than adults.

747,May-18,"The greatest challenge is that the major drivers of inequality are systemic and structural. Different social welfare models operate on different assumptions, implement different responses, and therefore produce widely varying but predictable results.

Singapore has a residual welfare system, which refers to a welfare regime where state support is a last resort, available only when other forms of help have been exhausted. This explains why assistance is strictly targeted, with eligibility and assessment regimes that create barriers to access. Unfortunately, this also incurs huge administrative costs.

One weakness of such a residual welfare model is that help kicks in when hardship is sufficiently severe and when the odds of overcoming disadvantage are much poorer.

Trans fats are popular with manufacturers of fried, baked and snack foods because they have a long shelf life, but they are bad for consumers, increasing heart disease risk by 21 per cent and deaths by 28 per cent, a WHO statement said.
Implementing the WHO's strategy for replacing trans fats, including promoting healthier alternatives and legislating against the harmful ingredients, would remove them from the food chain and score a major victory against heart disease, he said.
Several rich countries have already virtually eliminated trans fats by putting limits on the amounts allowed in packaged foods.
Some have banned partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of industrially-produced trans fats, the organisation said.","heart, disease, trans, fats, calls, eliminated, industriallyproduced, foods, organisation, deaths, health, world",Food safety/contamination

Yet, if one were to stand at any stretch of road and observe, one would notice vehicles including, public buses, zooming past at speeds in excess of these limits.

Even our school zones lack these signs to remind drivers.

In the United States, reducing driving speed by half in a school zone is required by law.

787,Feb-18,"Hundreds of Rohingya villages have been torched in the crackdown, according to refugees and monitoring groups. Human Rights Watch said on Friday that another 55 villages have been razed since November.

The Rohingya have been systematically stripped of their legal rights in mainly Buddhist Myanmar in recent decades and face rampant discrimination.

Myanmar denies seeking to eradicate the minority but refuses to give UN investigators access to an area where thousands of Rohingya are believed to have been killed.

In November, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement to repatriate some 750,000 Rohingya over two years. Last week Dhaka sent a list of 8,000 names to Myanmar for verification.

NO GOING BACK

But Rohingya leaders bluntly refuse to return. The UN says anyone who goes back must be a volunteer, while Myanmar shows no sign of accepting the Rohingya as full citizens.

""If they send us back, we'll be tortured or killed. We would rather be killed here in Bangladesh. Here, at least I'll get a Muslim burial,"" said Mohammad Elias, whose group has staged protests against repatriation in recent weeks.

According to the UN, since the repatriation deal was signed on Nov 23, nearly 70,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh through different routes in and near Cox's Bazar district.

""Those who came in recent days said they were tortured,"" Mainuddin Khan, Teknaf town police chief, told AFP.

Some Rohingya who remained in Rakhine's three main Muslim districts said the situation has improved in parts of the region, but life in the empty villages was unbearable.

Maun Maung Tin, a Rohingya from Maungdaw, said it was impossible to buy or sell goods and they were afraid to complain to authorities.

Feldman said the family was part of a buyer's program and had received mailers about sales and promotions from the company, but they had never received notice of the recall. The family is planning to sue.

Jozef's death mirrors those of three other boys, all about two years old, who died after being crushed by toppled Malm dressers. The families of the three boys, who were also represented by Feldman, won a US$50 million settlement from the company in late 2016.

847,Nov-17,"This is because of genetic and other factors underlying mental illness, a host of overseas research has found, said Ms Voon Yen Sing, assistant director of clinical services at the Singapore Association for Mental Health. Parenting ability may also be affected by the illnesses, social workers said.

Ms Tan said: ""Some parents suffer from depression, (and) may take it out on their kids unknowingly and this strains their relationship. Another worry is that the children learn their parents' unhealthy coping skills.""

For example, a teenage boy whose mother suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) began, over time, to wash his hands compulsively, aside from displaying other OCD symptoms, she said.

Another teenage girl mixed with bad company and ran away from home as she felt her depressed mother did not care for her.

The truth was, her mother was struggling to cope herself. Project Orchid's staff helped them to communicate with and understand each other better to improve ties.

Its social workers educate the children to understand their parents' illness and help parents understand how their illness affects their children. And they teach both sides how to cope with stress.

Like AMKFSC, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), which has a similar initiative for children of patients called I'm A Resilient Kid, also finds it challenging to reach out to the children of its patients.

IMH senior medical social worker Michelle Shanthini Gunasilan said: ""Some parents are apprehensive in letting their children know about their mental illness as they are unsure if it will undermine their role as a parent and affect their relationship with their child.""

The IMH programme started in 2008 with group sessions where the children learn about mental illness, and receive support from social workers and other children in similar circumstances.

Last year, it also included individual sessions so children and families could have more attention, for example, through counselling, to help them cope.

And for those in situations where the parent may be suicidal or violent, the child is also taught how to seek help if he should feel unsafe. Over 200 children have gone through the programme since it was started in 2008.

Social workers welcome the Project Orchid initiative to support these children, given the multiple stresses they may face.

About one in eight adult Singaporeans or permanent residents has experienced a mental illness, according to the nationwide Singapore Mental Health Study in 2010.

The Secondary 1 student from Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) (GMSS) had swung his body forward and both his feet became entangled in the net of the goalpost.

An inquiry into his death yesterday heard that at this point, he likely struggled.

This caused the sides of the goalpost to unfold and as the structure collapsed, the crossbar struck the boy's head, knocking him unconscious.

State Coroner Marvin Bay, who found Hambali's death to be a tragic misadventure, said the bleeding boy was rushed to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, where he died about two hours later of the head injury on April 24 this year.

Investigation officer Irina Ng told the court that the goalpost had a back bar which could enhance its stability. But the back bar had corroded by April this year.

The school had purchased the goalpost in 2014.

The back bar of a goalpost runs on the ground behind the goalkeeper, parallel to the crossbar.

Inspector Ng told the court that the back bar is an optional feature and it is not compulsory to have it.

908,Jul-17,"We thank Ms Dipa Swaminathan and Mr Rajasegaran Ramasamy for their feedback (Consider stiffer measures to deter work safety breaches, July 17; and Developers must get involved in safety meetings too, July 21).

Ms Dipa proposed filing criminal charges against company directors when accidents happen.

We already do so. Failure to take adequate measures to ensure the safety and health of workers is a criminal offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA).

Since 2014, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has prosecuted 27 individuals under the WSHA, of which 13 were company directors.

Ms Dipa also proposed requiring companies with safety breaches to have an escrow account with funds awarded to injured workers, in addition to Work Injury Compensation (WIC).

The current WIC system, where employers are liable for compensation regardless of fault, already provides an expeditious framework for WIC. Compensation limits are also reviewed regularly.

That said, we will consider working with the insurance industry to place a heavier financial responsibility on unsafe companies, for example through higher WIC insurance premiums.

Mr Rajasegaran's suggestion to have independent WSH officers runs counter to the principle of greater industry ownership in accident prevention.

Employers are ultimately responsible for workplace safety and health. They should work with and empower their WSH officers to drive workplace safety and health improvements on the ground.

We would also like to clarify that developers are not exempted from the WSHA.

Since Aug 1 last year, developers have been obligated to incorporate safety into project design and planning.

Developers are also not prevented from being part of the Project Safety Coordination Committee.

Yong Xing Construction and its project manager Zhong Jia Xiang were charged under the Workplace Safety and Health Act for the 2015 incident where a concrete slab fell on two workers.
Six workers were manually excavating soil underneath a box drain at a Sunview Way construction site when a concrete slab collapsed from the underside of the box drain, killing Mr Dewan Ratul and injuring Mr Sheikh Sapan.
An investigation by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) found that Yong Xing Construction provided inadequate risk assessment and safety control measures.
Investigations found that Mr Zhong was aware that the concrete on the underside of the box drain could collapse as the concrete was only supported by the soil it sat on.","manager, mr, xing, site, yong, construction, accident, safety, fatal, workers, fined, box, concrete, zhong, project, drain",Food safety/contamination

When the law takes effect later this year, the LTA and other agencies, such as the National Parks Board, will be given powers to issue summonses that could result in fines of up to $5,000, or jail terms of up to six months, for reckless riding behaviour.

The Sunday Times spent about four hours last Monday with Mr Asrul and his colleague, Mr Shaik Shameer Ali, 34, in the northern part of Singapore.

They stopped and inspected electric bicycles for illegal modifications, and advised cyclists and PMD users to ride carefully. They were also on the lookout for PMD users riding illegally on the roads, and indiscriminately parked shared bicycles left behind by users.

Mr Shameer, who joined the team three months ago, said that when he sees cyclists or PMD users who are not flouting any rules, he smiles and tells them to take care and ride safe.

But there are nasty encounters. About two weeks ago, he stopped a cyclist for having an illegally modified electric bicycle with a throttle. Throttles, which let users move without pedalling, have been banned on electric bicycles since 2005.
