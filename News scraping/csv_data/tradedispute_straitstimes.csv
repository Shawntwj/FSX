0,02/2022,MUNICH (NYTIMES) ,Would it be a massive strike or minor incursion if Russia moves on Ukraine?,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/would-it-be-a-massive-strike-or-minor-incursion-if-russia-moves-on-ukraine,"Hours before, Mr Biden had informed them that US intelligence agencies had just learnt that the Kremlin had given the order for Russian military units to proceed with an invasion.
Now the debate has shifted to how Mr Putin will do it: in one massive nationwide attack; a series of bites that dismantle the country, piece by piece; or a python-like squeeze.
Mr Putin might be betting that he can shatter Ukraine's economy and oust its government without having to immediately roll in tanks.
French President Emmanuel Macron said both the US and Russia have agreed to a summit in the coming days.
The White House confirmed Mr Biden had agreed to the meeting with Mr Putin in principle, provided Russia does not invade Ukraine.","russia, incursion, massive, russian, biden, president, intelligence, mr, ukraine, minor, strike, moves, world, piece, coming, putin",trade dispute

The interim suspension means Todd, who trains in Wiltshire in Britain, will be unable to race horses in Britain or internationally until investigations into the circumstances surrounding the incident are carried out.
Todd, who won individual gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles and 1988 Seoul Olympics and also took a bronze medal in the team event at the London 2012 Games, has apologised for the incident.","horse, video, trains, london, racing, suspension, mark, bha, showing, todd, horsestriking, suspended, olympic, striking, champion",trade dispute

The criticism by the head of state, Mr Gitanas Nauseda, opens a rift in the country's leadership after tensions between China and Lithuania triggered a high-level trade dispute between Beijing and the European Union.
China responded to the opening by downgrading diplomatic ties with Lithuania, recalling its ambassador and allegedly halting clearance for Lithuanian exports, which prompted the EU to raise the dispute with the World Trade Organisation.
Lithuania pulled out its diplomats from its embassy in Beijing in December after the Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded the return of the envoys' diplomatic identification cards.
A Taiwanese company purchased 20,400 bottles of Lithuanian rum that China refused to allow into the country to show support for the Baltic nation, according to the South China Morning Post.","taiwan, foreign, president, spat, mistake, nauseda, diplomatic, trade, rebukes, china, office, chinese, lithuanian, lithuania",trade dispute

Former US president Donald Trump approved steep tariffs on solar panel imports in January 2018 to protect US producers, triggering an outcry from China and South Korea, and even protests from the American solar industry.
Beijing requested the WTO set up a dispute panel to judge whether the tariffs violated international trade rules, and in its decision, the body said it ""rejected all of China's claims"".
""I welcome the WTO panel's findings rejecting China's challenges to the US solar safeguard as baseless,"" she said in a statement.

A: Singapore has among the highest number of lightning strikes per annum. But no car has been known to have been damaged by lightning.

Vietnam has been on Washington's watch list of currency manipulators because of its trade surplus with the US, a large current-account surplus and a perception that its central bank has been actively buying foreign currency.

Bilbao almost opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime, however Alex Berenguer's free kick bounced just wide of Thibaut Courtois's far post.

353,02/2021,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi on Sunday, made after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Teheran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency today.

Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since the United States, under former president Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.

The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms.

US President Joe Biden has said he wants to talk about both nations returning to the accord, though the two sides have been at odds about who makes the first step.

Teheran over the weekend renewed its demand that the US rejoin the accord and lift its crippling sanctions on Iran before talks can resume.

A key part of Iran's plan for reducing cooperation is to end implementation of the additional protocol, under which Teheran allows the IAEA to carry out unannounced inspections of nuclear material and installations where undeclared activity is suspected.

""The additional protocol, much to my regret, is going to be suspended,"" Mr Grossi said.

While the IAEA can still enter Iran to account for declared nuclear stockpiles, oversight of places such as machine shops and mines involved in uranium enrichment will be lost, as will camera surveillance of Iranian nuclear sites.

The IAEA and Teheran earlier issued a joint statement saying Iran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.

The IAEA will also continue ""necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months"", the statement said, without specifying what those activities are.

Mr Grossi said the steps that Iran plans to take this week would be ""to a certain extent mitigated"" by the terms of this new, temporary deal",UN nuclear watchdog strikes deal with Iran,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/un-nuclear-watchdog-strikes-deal-with-iran,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

Both sides are expected to claim victory, however, with US sources pointing to the higher core tariffs in favour of Boeing.
European sources said the latest award does not include some US$4.2 billion of tariffs against the US left over from an earlier case, giving the EU US$8.2 billion in total firepower.

Analysts say the very idea that Japan might acquire a strike capability - even if couched in the name of defence - is controversial and would be one of the greatest paradigm shifts in Japanese defence policy since the war.
But Mr Abe stressed that Japan will act within the framework of its war-renouncing Constitution and comply with international law, emphasising: ""There is no change to our defence-oriented posture.""
Analysts said the timing was a deliberate attempt by Mr Abe to imprint his legacy on defence issues after his controversial bid to revise the Constitution fell apart.
A first-strike capability means Japan will be able to launch a strike on enemy bases before missiles are even fired - unlike now when it can stop targets after they are launched.","firststrike, way, paves, defence, successor, japan, country, mr, shinzo, abe, strike, capability, statement, japanese, missile",trade dispute

Yet, behind the scenes a more productive discussion is taking place, with both desperately searching for new approaches to a relationship for which there is no legal precedent.

Britain's future trade arrangement with the EU is the first priority, partly because this is the most complex challenge, but also because the negotiations over a future trade deal operate under a very tight timetable.

According to the schedule agreed between London and Brussels, all the trade talks must be concluded by the end of the year, when the current transitory arrangements, which allow both sides to trade as though no separation had taken place, expire.

In practice, the timetable is even shorter, for the trade talks are being launched only early next month, and have to conclude by November at the latest, since 28 various national Parliaments will need to ratify the deal.

""That matters, because with unrealistic export targets, the deal may be doomed from the start.
The unrealistic nature of China's purchase commitments has been a common criticism of the trade deal, especially from China watchers and trade experts who call for US President Donald Trump to focus more on restructuring China's market economy and ending its unfair trade practices rather than shrinking the US-China trade deficit.
But even when China's economy was booming from 2000 to 2007, US exports to China grew by 21 per cent a year in that period, Dr Bown said.
""With China's economy currently growing much more slowly, for reasons unrelated to the trade war, sustaining 18 per cent annual export growth over a four-year period would be a challenge,"" he wrote.","economist, deal, pledges, cent, billion, trade, purchase, china, unrealistic, chinas, economy, 2017, exports",trade dispute

Yet his stature as the second most powerful person in Iran made him almost untouchable in the eyes of Donald Trump's predecessors.
Soon after the attack, Trump ordered a handful of his most senior aides to begin planning a strike on the Iranian general, according to three people familiar with the matter.
A small number of lawyers on the National Security Council were involved.
Secrecy was paramount, as aides worried that one of Trump's most fraught and consequential decisions would be leaked ahead of the strike.","iranian, tight, trump, aides, washington, general, powerful, swiftly, national, strike, attack, security, soleimani, obrien, trumps, circle, planned",trade dispute

Health officials have voiced concern that the power plant shut down could aggravate a novel coronavirus outbreak in Gaza, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.","balloons, targets, strip, military, palestinians, power, amid, gaza, strikes, israel, israeli, incendiary, covid19, hamas, plant, lockdown",trade dispute

The city state made the list of 20 global markets that are most rapidly improving their individual potential for trade to grow, coming in at 16th place, according to the bank's new Trade20 Index.

The Trade20 study examined 12 metrics across 66 economies, analysing changes across three equally weighted pillars of economic dynamism, trade readiness and export diversity.

The economic dynamism pillar was measured by inward foreign direct investments (FDI), export volume growth and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Trade readiness refers to the market's foundations to support future trade growth, measured by factors such as the quality of trade and transport infrastructure and ease of doing business, while export diversity was measured by factors such as export count.

Topping the list was Cote d'Ivoire, followed by India, Kenya and China. Hong Kong took 11th place, above Sri Lanka at 14th.

Singapore's ranking in the index was largely thanks to its economic dynamism, amid increasing levels of inward FDI, StanChart said. The Republic had placed fourth in the 2019 world ranking of FDI destinations by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

US concerns regarding the WTO appeals court include allegations of judicial overreach, delays in rendering decisions and judges' bloated salaries.

In the context of smoking, it is the smokers' right to decide how and when they wish to do whatever chosen amount of harm to their bodies.

Lawmakers are always in a dilemma because despite recognising the third",Forum: Striking a balance between personal liberty and public health,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/striking-a-balance-between-personal-liberty-and-public-health,"Smoking kills smokers and the people around them, and many in the community have called for a ban on cigarettes.

In the context of smoking, it is the smokers' right to decide how and when they wish to do whatever chosen amount of harm to their bodies.
Singapore's approach to the issue has been effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking among the young by introducing more barriers to entry.
By raising the legal age to smoke, raising tobacco tax and banning smoking in more places, Singapore is making it harder for non-smokers to pick up smoking.","harm, right, balance, liberty, smokers, ban, young, public, smoking, reducing, health, bodies, raising, forum, striking, liberties, personal",trade dispute
551,10/2019,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING • China hopes to reach a phased agreement in a protracted trade dispute with the US and cancel tariffs as soon as possible, the Commerce Ministry said yesterday, adding that trade wars had no winners.

A phased agreement would help restore market confidence and reduce uncertainty, said ministry spokesman Gao Feng, adding that both sides were maintaining close communication.

""The final goal of both sides' negotiations is to end the trade war and cancel all additional tariffs,"" he said. ""This would benefit China, the United States and the whole world. We hope that both sides will continue to work together, advance negotiations, and reach a phased agreement as soon as possible.""

US President Donald Trump last week outlined the first phase of a deal and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said more work needed to be done. Mr Trump had planned to proceed with a hike in tariffs to 30 per cent from 25 per cent on about US$250 billion (S$342 billion) worth of Chinese goods last week.

The US administration has yet to decide on how to address an additional planned 10 per cent tariffs on roughly US$156 billion worth of Chinese goods due to take effect on Dec 15.

US and Chinese negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, said US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday, adding that he was prepared to travel to Beijing for more meetings if necessary.

The strike pits Mr Macron, a 41-year-old former investment banker who came to power in 2017 on a promise to open up France's highly regulated economy, against powerful trade unions who say he is set on dismantling worker protections.
Mr Macron's government, along with many ordinary French citizens, have made plans to cope with the strike action through the weekend, but may take a different view on Monday if the disruption extends into a second week.
Rail workers voted to extend their strike through Friday, while labour unions at the Paris bus and metro operator RATP said their walkout would continue until Monday.

578,08/2019,"And that is what's happening.

German has spewed wretched economic data for weeks: an 8 per cent annual fall in exports in June, a 1.5 per cent drop in industrial production in June from the month before, three times bigger than expected.

Surveys of company executives suggest the industrial sector is in recession, with consumer demand and services propping up the economy.

But the damage from trade may be spreading to consumers and companies that do business only at home. While unemployment remains low at 3.1 per cent, job gains have stalled recently.

Ironically, trade between Germany and the US and between Germany and China is holding up pretty well. It's mainly the uncertainty about the outcome of the clash between US President Donald Trump and the Chinese Communist leadership that has been weighing on business confidence and deterring decisions to invest and buy across global markets.

Last week, Mr Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$300 billion (S$415.64 billion) in Chinese goods effective Sept 1.

As a result, research firm Oxford Economics forecasts world trade growth of just 1.2 per cent this year, far below last year's 4.9 per cent rise.

There are a few small benefits for Europe. While the US and China ramped up barriers against each other, the US has largely kept tariffs on European products the same, except for introducing charges on steel and aluminum imports. China has actually lowered charges on exports from the 19 European countries that use the euro.

""That mildly positive effect for the eurozone has been, however, more than offset by the hit to business sentiment and demand,"" says economist Florian Hense at Berenberg bank. ""As uncertainty about the future trading regime is pervasive, businesses have cut their outlook and their investment plans. The slowdown in Chinese actual and potential growth, which the trade tensions have exacerbated, also weighs on demand for eurozone exports.""

Mr Trump has recently repeated threats to increase tariffs on autos if he does not get a satisfactory new trade deal with the EU.

Germany's top companies issued cautious outlooks along with their earnings for the most recent quarter, even those that are doing relatively well.

Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess warned that ""growing protectionism also poses major challenges for the globally integrated auto industry.""

China on Saturday announced details of the national security legislation, unveiling that Beijing will have overarching powers over its enforcement and signalling the deepest change to the city's way of life since the handover.
The planned law has alarmed foreign governments as well as democracy activists in Hong Kong, who were already concerned that Beijing was tightening its grip over the semi-autonomous city.
Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong have sought to reassure investors that the law will not erode the city's high degree autonomy, insisting it will target only a minority of""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security.","unions, support, fail, hong, legislation, citys, national, strikes, beijing, security, law, prodemocracy, kong, short, students",trade dispute

The new policy would be within the boundaries of international law, the country's war-renouncing constitution and its exclusively defensive national security posture, the Sankei newspaper said, citing officials it didn't identify.
Acquiring such capability could cost huge sums of money and increase the likelihood that Japan would be the target of an attack.
Japan's National Security Council, which Abe leads and includes key cabinet officials, including Suga, convened on Friday and said in a statement it would formulate a new national security strategy by the end of the year.
One of the last major decisions this year from the Abe government was to drop plans to build the US-backed Aegis Ashore ballistic-missile-defence programme.","swansong, strategy, officials, tokyo, japans, national, suga, missilestrike, security, capability, push, statement, abe, prime, missile",trade dispute

629,09/2019,"SAN FRANCISCO • Trade policy uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's escalating dispute with China will mean hundreds of billions of dollars in lost US output and as much as US$850 billion (S$1.18 trillion) lost globally through early next year, research published this week by the Federal Reserve suggests.

The Fed researchers analysed newspaper articles and corporate earnings calls to estimate trade policy uncertainty, finding that it has recently ""shot up to levels not seen since the 1970s"".

Other economists, notably Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom and his colleagues, have documented a similar rise in uncertainty.

The Fed researchers then estimated the blow such uncertainty delivers to economic activity, as businesses pull back on investment and production. They concluded that globally and in the United States, its impact is around 1 per cent to GDP.

With United States GDP estimated at about US$20 trillion, and world GDP at about US$85 trillion, a 1 per cent impact would put the drag from trade uncertainty at about US$200 billion to US GDP, and US$850 billion to global GDP, according to Reuters calculations.

The estimates, the researchers said, are uncertain.

But they are notable in that they are among the first to quantify the large impact of US President Donald Trump's approach to trade deals, which he says put the US economy at a global disadvantage.

In an effort to win better trade terms, the Trump administration has jacked up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports and imposed or threatened to impose duties on imports from other trading partners, including Mexico and the European Union. China and other countries, in turn, have threatened or imposed their own tariffs on US goods.

Mr Trump has called on the Fed to slash US interest rates to support the economy and offset the effects of the trade war.

Fed policymakers for their part have said they will not let politics dictate interest",Trade uncertainty to shave $1.2 trillion off global output: Study,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/trade-uncertainty-to-shave-12-trillion-off-global-output-study,"The Fed researchers analysed newspaper articles and corporate earnings calls to estimate trade policy uncertainty, finding that it has recently ""shot up to levels not seen since the 1970s"".

Some domestic and foreign policy experts have also argued that it is a slippery slope towards aggression and militarism.
Mr Abe, who abruptly resigned last Friday (Aug 28) but is staying on as PM until a successor is chosen, will likely map out a new security policy at a National Security Council meeting to be held by next week.
Mr Abe will also oversee talks on an alternative plan for the United States' land-based Aegis Ashore anti-ballistic missile system, which Japan ditched in June after it found that a costly technical redesign was necessary to ensure that boosters would not fall on residential areas.
The Aegis Ashore system had been meant to beef up Japan's missile defences against external threats, primarily North Korea.","policy, talks, firststrike, enemy, system, japan, weapons, japans, ashore, security, capability, oversee, abe, missile",trade dispute

In contrast, hardline CGT union warned last Thursday that there would be no break for Christmas unless the government dropped the whole pension reform plan.

The strikes, which began on Thursday over plans for a single, points-based pension scheme, recalled the winter of 1995, when three weeks of stoppages forced a social policy U-turn by the then-government.
The biggest labour unrest in years comes as France's economy is already dented by more than a year of weekly anti-government protests by ""yellow vest"" activists, and with Mr Macron's popularity falling.
The mass strike closed schools on Thursday and hobbled commuters in Paris and its suburbs as well as other major cities through the weekend.
Many opted to take days off or to work from home, but thousands had no choice but to squeeze into perilously overfull suburban trains and metros whose numbers were slashed to a minimum.","chaos, thousands, pension, paris, unrelenting, macrons, retirement, transport, labour, country, strike, french, frances, yellow, work, bites",trade dispute

They found that the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection was the same for women and men, as ""exactly half"" of the confirmed cases were male patients.

While China is not as dependent on exports as in the past, they still account for nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product.

Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply last month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.

Mr Trump on May 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of Chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining US$300 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on US goods.

Mr Trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Group of 20 leaders' summit later this month, but analysts such as Capital Economics believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding, as both sides appear to be digging in for a long battle.

Trade sanctions are spreading from goods to services, Capital Economics noted last week, with China issuing a warning to citizens about risks of travelling in the US and American lawmakers pushing to tighten visas for Chinese students.

Damage from the trade war along with a broader softening in global demand will make 2019 the worst year for trade since the financial crisis a decade ago, with only 0.2 per cent growth, according to economists at ING.

The action could escalate a trade dispute between Indonesia - the world's top palm oil producer - and the EU, which plans to end its use of biofuels by 2030, citing concerns over widespread deforestation caused by the sector.
In response to what it called ""discriminative"" policies against its key palm oil exports, Indonesia said it filed a complaint with the WTO last week.
Neighbouring Malaysia, the world's second-biggest palm oil producer, has also threatened WTO action against the EU.
Ms Teresa Kok, the minister overseeing Malaysia's palm oil sector, told AFP on Monday that she would head to Europe in March, and a challenge would not be filed until after then.","filed, world, organisation, producer, worlds, plans, indonesia, trade, files, lawsuit, palm, wto, eu, oil",trade dispute

President Donald Trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield US manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition. He has pledged to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that a 12.4 per cent jump in the goods deficit in December had contributed to the record US$891.3 billion (S$1.2 trillion) goods trade shortfall last year.

In one of his Friday tweets, Trump said ""I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world.""

Trump spoke on Friday with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to discuss the situation with Iran, stability in the region and the global oil market, the White House said.

Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Seyed Abbas Araghchi said the country had ""indisputable"" evidence the US drone had violated Iranian air space, and state TV showed what it said were recovered parts of the downed aircraft.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran would not hesitate for a moment to decisively defend its territory against any aggression,"" Araghchi said in a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday.

One US official insisted there was unanimity among Trump's advisers on a response. Before the strike was called off, there were discussions on Thursday about whether to heighten security and awareness at sensitive domestic sites, another official said.

Earlier on Thursday, as the attack was being planned, Trump downplayed Iran's strike on the US Navy drone in the Persian Gulf that escalated regional tensions and fuelled a surge in oil prices, suggesting a ""loose and stupid"" individual may have been responsible for the strike.

""I would imagine it was a general or somebody who made a mistake by shooting that drone down,"" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""I find it hard to believe it was intentional. It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid.""

The planned US operation was first reported by the New York Times, which said that Trump had pulled back as warplanes were in the air. Two US officials disputed that part of the Times account. Warplanes weren't en route to the strike when Trump called off the action, though ships and planes already deployed in the region were in position to carry it out, one of the officials said.

The drone strike targeted Islamic militants in the Ouagadou forest, where a group known as the Macina Liberation Front is active.
She said they allow French troops more discretion and flexibility, and insisted that France will respect rules of armed conflict in using the drones.","military, defence, drones, 1st, carries, drone, armed, strike, french, mali, group, ministry, france, troops",trade dispute

Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) also disputed a Korean official's statement that Seoul had asked Japan on Friday to withdraw the restrictions.
But a Korean trade ministry official shot back that Seoul had ""clearly demanded Japan withdraw its trade restrictions at yesterday's meeting, and there should be no disagreement over that matter with Japan.""
He told Reuters the two sides had discussed what they would disclose but that there was no agreement.
It comes amid deep frustration in Japan over what Tokyo sees as Seoul's failure to act in response to a South Korean court ruling ordering a Japanese company to compensate former forced labourers from the Second World War.","ministry, blasts, seoul, bilateral, seko, japan, japans, explanation, sides, trade, mistaken, meeting, minister, korea, south, korean",trade dispute

The strike, the longest in Taiwan's aviation history where labour unrest is uncommon, has led Eva to estimate a revenue loss of about NT$1.75 billion (S$76 million).
There was no indication of any resolution early on Wednesday, with a union representing Eva flight attendants urging the firm to come back to the negotiation table, saying no renewed contact between the parties had been initiated.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Eva said it had reached ""some initial agreements"" with the union and that ""the company's door is always open for flight attendants to come home"".","cabin, taiwans, drags, air, broke, hundreds, latest, flight, cancels, strike, attendants, come, crew, flights, eva, union",trade dispute

The website has been up and running since Thursday (Aug 1), a day before Japan decided to drop South Korea from the so-called ""white list"" of easy trade countries in the midst of a growing dispute between the two countries over their wartime past.
""There have been myriads of requests from companies that need a clear picture of what getting removed from the white list means,"" a South Korean trade ministry official told Reuters on Friday, referring to the reason for the website.
South Korea's removal from the favoured trade countries list may require South Korean firms to take extra administrative procedures to obtain import permits, potentially slowing down purchases of a wide range of Japanese goods that can be used for weapons production.

Beijing has taken years to approve new strains of GM crops, and US companies and farmers have complained that this stalls trade by restricting the sales of new products from companies such as DowDuPont Inc, Bayer AG and Syngenta AG.

The issue is one of a host of US complaints that the Trump administration is demanding China address if it wants to end the trade dispute that has cost both countries billions of dollars and slowed the global economy. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the two sides were getting very close to a deal that could be announced in about four weeks, though there were still differences to be bridged.

GM crops and the approval process are still a ""big issue"" in the discussions, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. China is the biggest buyer of US soya beans, the bulk of which are genetically modified. If it does not approve new strains, then farmers in the US cannot plant them because China may reject shipments that include them. Seed companies cannot fully commercialise sales of new strains without those approvals.

Another sign that the industry has yet to price in the trade risk is that analysts have been slow in lowering their estimates.
Since the US-China trade spat escalated last month, analysts have cut their forecasts at a rate that is half the pace seen for the broad market.
As the world's largest consumer of semiconductors, China accounts for more than half of the US$470 billion industry.

The US Treasury Department last Monday (Aug 5) labelled China a currency manipulator, hours after China let the yuan drop through a key support level to its lowest point in more than a decade.

Islamic Jihad later said in a statement two of its members were killed in the strike.

In the past week, however, China weakened commitments for reform that it had made in negotiations for a deal to end the trade war.

Benzema fired into the bottom corner to give Real the lead on the hour mark after an inspired piece of play by Eden Hazard, who fashioned a one-two with Luka Modric before sliding to the ground to nudge the ball into the path of French striker.
Marco Asensio scored with his first touch since injuring his knee 11 months ago to double Real's lead in the 74th minute before Benzema rounded off the win with a jaw-dropping volley which he set up by flicking the ball from one foot to the other.
Valencia looked to have taken the lead when Rodrigo Moreno scored in the 20th minute but long after the players had celebrated the goal it was chalked off for offside against Maxi Gomez, even though the striker had not touched the ball.

Last year, a WTO dispute panel supported Japan, saying South Korea was wrong to keep its initial trade restrictions in place.
But Thursday's ruling overturned several key points of that verdict, saying South Korea's measures were not overly restrictive and did not unfairly discriminate against Japan.
South Korea widened its initial ban on Japanese fishery imports in 2013 to cover all seafood from eight Japanese prefectures including Fukushima.
South Korea imported 10.9 billion yen (S$130 million) worth of Japanese seafood in the year to August 2013 before it broadened its restrictions.","restrictions, initial, koreas, food, fukushima, levels, saying, appeal, trade, korea, seafood, wto, succeeds, south, japanese, dispute",trade dispute

In downtown Santiago, the streets were unusually quiet as buses scaled back service and many people refrained from commuting to work in anticipation of protests.","workers, massive, wreaking, protests, sight, capital, public, chile, strike, unrest, santiago, work, anticipation, congress, businesses, end, protesters, planned",trade dispute

New Southampton striker Che Adams went close early, sliding in at the back post to meet a dangerous cross from Yan Valery but the 15 million pound ($18.05 million) signing from Birmingham City couldn't find the target.
It was a scrappy affair in wild winds and driving rain but the breakthrough came in the 63rd minute when Saints defender Jannik Vestergaard misjudged a hopeful long ball forward from Erik Pieters and Barnes latched on to it and fired home.
The pair combined again for the Clarets' second, seven minutes later with Dutch debutant Pieter's cross from deep met superbly on the volley by Barnes.
Icelandic winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson made it 3-0 in the 75th, winning a challenge with Ryan Bertrand and bursting goal ward before beating goalkeeper Angus Gunn with a precise finish.","twice, pieters, barnes, minute, sink, football, million, close, burnley, southampton, clarets, ball, strikes, cross, sorry, signing",trade dispute

Idlib and surrounding areas of the north-west were included in a ""de-escalation"" deal last year between Mr Assad's main ally Russia and Turkey, which backs some rebel groups, to reduce warfare and bombardment.
Over the past three months, the offensive has driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes or temporary shelters to seek refuge near the border with Turkey and has killed hundreds of civilians, according to war monitoring groups.

Such safeguard measures are permitted to protect home-grown industries from sudden import increases that harm domestic players.

Alsom Island, located 18km off North Korea's north-eastern coast, has been targeted in more than 25 missile strikes since 2019.
So much firepower directed at a single spot has prompted jokes that Mr Kim must have a grudge, with weapons expert Joseph Dempsey quipping on Twitter that Alsom was North Korea's ""most hated rock"".
In recent weeks, Mr Kim has honed his newest short-range ballistic missiles on Alsom, some of which have slammed into the rocky outcrop at speeds possibly in excess of 3,000kmh.
At about 850m in length, it is small enough to show the US and its allies that Mr Kim can hit what he aims at.","keeps, small, systems, koreas, structure, aiming, rock, mr, hated, weapons, used, jong, north, island, kim, south, missiles",trade dispute

Crude prices soared to seven-year highs partly because of the Abu Dhabi attacks, which exploded fuel tanks near storage facilities of oil giant ADNOC.
After the attacks, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed agreed to “jointly stand up to these acts of aggression”, UAE state media said.
‘No end in sight’The Abu Dhabi attack marked a new phase in the Yemen war and further reduced hopes of any resolution to the conflict, which has displaced millions in what was already the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country.
The targeting of Abu Dhabi followed intense clashes in Yemen, including advances by the UAE-trained Giants Brigade, who drove the rebels out of Shabwa province.","coalition, rebels, yemen, killed, saudi, abu, dhabi, 14, strikes, dead, houthis, uae, bombs, attack",trade dispute

Taiwan, whose relations with China are at their lowest in decades, had previously threatened to raise the matter at the global trade watchdog.
The fruits in question are sugar apples, also known as sweetsops or custard apples, and wax apples, both Taiwan specialities which do not really resemble apples.
China views Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunified by force, if necessary.
The specific trade concern filed by Taiwan at the WTO's committee is a preliminary step, although a portion of such complaints later become formal WTO disputes.","taiwan, specific, complaint, raised, raises, statement, trade, meeting, china, apples, wto, fruit, dispute",trade dispute

1591,02/2022,"LONDON (REUTERS) – An Atlantic storm battered northwestern European on Friday (Feb 18) with record winds of up to 196kmh, killing at least nine people, knocking out power for tens of thousands and shredding the roof of London’s O2 arena.

Storm Eunice, which brewed in the central Atlantic and was spun up from the Azores towards Europe by the jet stream, posed a danger to life, Britain’s Meteorological Office said.

The storm hit western England, making landfall in Cornwall, where waves lashed the coast, sending plumes of spray over the roofs of cottages, Reuters pictures showed.

A woman was killed in London when a car in which she was travelling was crushed by a tree and a man in a vehicle in Liverpool died due to flying debris. Another man died after a vehicle collided with a fallen tree in the southern English county of Hampshire.

In the Netherlands, four people were killed by toppled trees. In Belgium, high winds brought a crane down onto the roof of a hospital and a British man died after being blown from his boat into the water.

A man died in Ireland after being struck by a falling tree while clearing storm debris, RTE reported.

High winds in London shredded the white domed roof of the O2 arena which has hosted stars from The Rolling Stones to Beyonce and Rihanna. Tall buildings in London trembled as wind whistled through Canary Wharf.

In Wales, waves crashed over Aberystwyth promenade, some as high as houses. More than 100,000 people were hit by power cuts as lines were torn down and ancient trees keeled over.

“Storm Eunice is really packing a punch,” Met Office Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders said. “We only issue red weather warnings when we think there is a threat to life from the weather.”

The Met Office said a gust of 196kmh was recorded at The Needles on the Isle of Wight, provisionally a record for the most powerful gust ever recorded in England.

Later on Friday, the Met Office said the fiercest winds from the storm were heading towards Scandinavia and northern mainland Europe where warnings had been issued.

But the disordered ending to the war has laid bare the strains inherent in Mr Biden's foreign policy, which calls for a return to protecting human rights and promoting democracy, but only when consistent with United States goals.
The President's withdrawal from Afghanistan makes clear that he saw risking more US lives there as no longer in America's national interest.
The Biden doctrine sees China as America's existential competitor, Russia as a disrupter, Iran and North Korea as nuclear proliferators, cyber threats as ever-evolving and terrorism as spreading far beyond Afghanistan.
But those attacks were retaliation against non-state actors and not intended to be followed by US troops on the ground.","foreign, doctrine, biden, military, president, americas, afghan, withdrawal, war, nuclear, diplomacy, surfaces, policy",trade dispute

1722,04/2021,"WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) Two South Korean manufacturers of electric vehicle batteries that are building plants in the United States said Sunday that they had reached a US$1.8 billion settlement in a trade secrets dispute that threatened the domestic battery supply and, with it, the Biden administration's green agenda.

The announcement came on the day of a deadline set by the United States' trade representative to decide whether to veto an International Trade Commission ruling in the intellectual property case between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation. The commission's ruling in favour of LG had threatened SK with a ban on supplying batteries in the country and put its facility under construction in Georgia at risk.

The plant, which is still under construction, will supply batteries for electric vehicles for Ford and Volkswagen, and with the settlement agreement, SK is now also free to seek business from other companies.

The dispute had threatened the domestic supply of batteries for electric vehicles. The settlement prevents delays in the development of American electric vehicles and supplies.

Georgia's politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, had been pressuring President Joe Biden to act on their state's behalf. Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, wrote to the president last month asking him to veto the commission's decision for the sake of Georgia's economy and the thousands of jobs that would be created at the battery plant.

""I congratulate both companies for working through their significant differences to resolve this dispute, which builds confidence in their reliability and responsibility as suppliers to the US auto industry,"" the trade representative, Katherine Tai, said in a statement on the settlement.

Biden called the settlement agreement ""a win for American workers and the American auto industry"" in a statement Sunday. ""A key part of my plan to Build Back Better is to have the electric vehicles and batteries of the future built here in America, all across America, by American workers.""

Mr Abe called for alternatives to defend against ballistic missiles, saying that new policies should be decided by the end of the year.
He offered vague language on whether that meant strike capability, but added the plan must abide by the country's exclusively defensive security stance.

1763,06/2019,"Mr Trump had been resisting a military response to repeated provocations by Iran for weeks by the time he woke up Thursday morning to discover that a US spy plane had been shot down. Now led by Mr John Bolton, his hawkish national security adviser, the president was faced with the choice of how to respond.

On Thursday morning, only hours after the drone was shot down, Mr Bolton met for breakfast at the White House at 7am with Mr Patrick Shanahan, the Acting Defence Secretary who had announced his resignation just three days earlier, as well as with Mr Mark Esper, the Army secretary set to replace Mr Shanahan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The group discussed the drone episode and deliberated a possible military response to recommend to the president. At 11am, the same group along with other national security officials met with Mr Trump to brief him on options for a strike on Iran. According to one administration official, the potential casualties of such an attack were discussed at that meeting.

But as usual, Mr Trump did not rely exclusively on his official team. Among the outsiders he talked with in the morning was Senator Lindsey Graham, a Repubulican from South Carolina, a close ally. Mr Graham urged that he consider a military response to the drone's shooting down.

At 3pm, Mr Trump hosted congressional leaders in the Situation Room to brief them about the episode and outline the alternative responses. At least some of those in the room left assuming that he was likely to order a strike.

Mr Trump was given a list of at least a dozen strike options generated this month after there were attacks on tankers in the region. The list was then narrowed down to at least two alternatives. Among the targets would be facilities like radar and missile batteries.

Administration officials said on Friday that the president's national security team was unanimous in favouring a response and all agreed with the final option recommended to Mr Trump. But several military officials said General Dunford cautioned about the possible repercussions of a strike, warning that it could endanger US forces and allies in the region. A 6pm meeting in Mr Shanahan's office at the Pentagon including General Dunford was described as particularly tense.

As for Mr Pompeo, he argued during meetings at the White House that sanctions were having a powerful effect by slashing Iran's revenues from oil sales, according to a senior administration official familiar with the discussion.

This marks a reversal of a weeks-long muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring Iran from attacking United States troops and diplomats in the Persian Gulf.
It is unclear whether Mr Trump was aware of Mr Miller's order to send the Nimitz home.
The Pentagon and Gen McKenzie's Central Command had for weeks publicised several shows of force to warn Teheran of the consequences of any assault.
Some aides also questioned the imminence of any attack by Iran or its proxies, an assessment reported earlier by CNN.","gen, strategy, miller, reversal, carrier, trump, iraq, abrupt, mr, iran, strike, aircraft, nimitz, proxies, pentagon, orders",trade dispute

ATTITUDE SHIFT

Trump's comments on Sunday came as a surprise after he and members of his team had repeatedly said the two sides were making progress on a deal.

Tensions between the two countries had eased as talks progressed after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a truce in the trade war in late November.

As recently as Friday, Trump had cited progress towards a deal.

The United States is demanding sweeping changes to China's economic policies, including better protection of US intellectual property, ending forced technology transfers and cyber theft of American trade secrets.

Washington also wants more access to China's vast markets for US companies, curbs on industrial subsidies and increased purchases of American products.

Trump appeared to defend his decision in a tweet early on Monday, lashing out over the US trade deficit with China. He also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on trade in a ""very good conversation.""

""With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!"" Trump tweeted.

The United States imported about US$539.5 billion in goods from China in 2018 and exported US$120.3 billion, for a record trade deficit of US$419.2 billion, according to US Census Bureau data.

Trump's change in tone came after US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told him that significant obstacles remained to a trade deal, and that China was pulling back from some previous commitments, people with knowledge of the talks said.

Lighthizer briefed Trump following a round of talks in Beijing last week.
