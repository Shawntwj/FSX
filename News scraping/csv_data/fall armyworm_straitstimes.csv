1,05/2018,"KISUMU, KENYA (AFP) ",Africa struggles for weapons against armyworm curse,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/africa/africa-struggles-for-weapons-against-armyworm-curse,"In just two years, the so-called fall armyworm has colonised three-quarters of Africa, according to the British-based Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI).
The fall armyworm is believed to have made its bridgehead in West Africa after being accidentally brought in from South America, its native home, by sea or air cargo.
The larval, or caterpillar, armyworm is perfectly adapted for destruction.
In the final two weeks, the armyworm caterpillar metamorphoses into a moth able to cover up to 100 kilometres in a night.
But for the experts, one thing is certain: the fall armyworm has made Africa its home.","caterpillar, armyworm, struggles, africa, crops, crop, food, fall, kenya, curse, maize, weapons, farmers",Pest and disease outbreaks
2,08/2021,KANDAHAR (NYTIMES) ,Afghan military was built over 20 years. How did it collapse so quickly?,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/afghan-military-was-built-over-20-years-how-did-it-collapse-so-quickly,"In the past several days, Afghan security forces have collapsed in more than 15 cities under the pressure of a Taleban advance that began in May.
This implosion comes despite the United States having poured more than US$83 billion (S$112 billion) in weapons, equipment and training into the country's security forces over two decades.
Building the Afghan security apparatus was one of the key parts of the Obama administration's strategy as it sought to find a way to hand over security and leave nearly a decade ago.
These efforts produced an army modelled in the image of the US military, an Afghan institution that was supposed to outlast the American war.
On one front line in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar last week, the Afghan security forces' seeming inability to fend off the Taleban's devastating offensive came down to potatoes.","officials, fighting, forces, week, kandahar, equipment, military, 20, built, security, taleban, quickly, afghan, collapse",Pest and disease outbreaks

The case - which hinged on whether the murder was premeditated or committed in the heat of the moment - is widely regarded as the catalyst for the Indian government ending the jury trial system in the 1960s.
The jury, swayed by media reports portraying Nanavati as a victim of the system, acquitted him (although the High Court subsequently found him guilty).
However, all nuances of such a landmark case are lost to overtures of melodrama and bad acting in Rustom.

If all incursions into Taiwan's air-defense-identification zone between Pratas and the Chinese mainland are included, the patrols have become an almost daily occurrence.
The Chinese focus on Pratas serves several aims of President Xi Jinping, highlighting Taiwan's vulnerability to attack while probing its defenses.
Taking Pratas Island - located closer to Hong Kong than Taiwan - could give China a new launching ground for future military operations without provoking a full-scale conflict with the US.
Meanwhile, the drumbeat of exercises adds to the domestic political concerns for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who rejects Beijing's claims to sovereignty.","president, xi, island, triggering, risks, taiwanese, taiwans, clash, china, military, uschina, taipei, pratas, farflung, chinese, taiwan",Pest and disease outbreaks
