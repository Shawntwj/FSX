0,Afghan military was built over 20 years. How did it collapse so quickly?,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/afghan-military-was-built-over-20-years-how-did-it-collapse-so-quickly,"In the past several days, Afghan security forces have collapsed in more than 15 cities under the pressure of a Taleban advance that began in May.
This implosion comes despite the United States having poured more than US$83 billion (S$112 billion) in weapons, equipment and training into the country's security forces over two decades.
Building the Afghan security apparatus was one of the key parts of the Obama administration's strategy as it sought to find a way to hand over security and leave nearly a decade ago.
These efforts produced an army modelled in the image of the US military, an Afghan institution that was supposed to outlast the American war.
On one front line in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar last week, the Afghan security forces' seeming inability to fend off the Taleban's devastating offensive came down to potatoes.","week, military, quickly, afghan, collapse, taleban, fighting, forces, kandahar, 20, built, officials, security, equipment"
1,"US allies retake control of prison in Syria, subduing Islamic State fighters",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/us-allies-retake-control-of-prison-in-syria-subduing-islamic-state-fighters,"On Sunday clearing operations continued in the Ghweran neighbourhood around the prison to find Islamic State sleeper cells.
Kurdish forces threw flash grenades into homes where they believed Islamic State fighters were hiding as residents gathered in the streets.
The latest round of fighting began this month after an attack by the Islamic State group on the prison, which housed more than 3,000 Islamic State members and almost 700 minors.
On Saturday, the SDF said that about 30 Islamic State fighters surrendered overnight but that the remaining militants in the prison were believed to be holding teenage detainees as human shields.
""We think there are cubs of the caliphate with them,"" Farhad Shami, an SDF spokesperson, said in reference to the children forced by the Islamic State to become fighters.","allies, sdf, kurdish, subduing, prison, state, operations, fighters, syria, militia, fighting, forces, islamic, control, retake"
2,Far-flung Taiwan island Pratas risks triggering a US-China clash,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/far-flung-taiwan-island-pratas-risks-triggering-a-us-china-clash,"The rest broke off and briefly darted further south toward tiny Pratas Island in the South China Sea before turning back.
If all incursions into Taiwan's air-defense-identification zone between Pratas and the Chinese mainland are included, the patrols have become an almost daily occurrence.
The Chinese focus on Pratas serves several aims of President Xi Jinping, highlighting Taiwan's vulnerability to attack while probing its defenses.
Taking Pratas Island - located closer to Hong Kong than Taiwan - could give China a new launching ground for future military operations without provoking a full-scale conflict with the US.
Meanwhile, the drumbeat of exercises adds to the domestic political concerns for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who rejects Beijing's claims to sovereignty.","taipei, military, china, xi, taiwan, taiwans, president, uschina, risks, taiwanese, farflung, chinese, pratas, triggering, clash, island"
