2,New high-tech trout farm to boost Singapore's annual farmed fish output by about 25%,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-high-tech-trout-farm-will-increase-singapores-current-annual-farmed-fish-output-by-a-quarter,"SINGAPORE - A high-tech farm cultivating trout is set to begin operating in Neo Tiew next year.
The farm will be capable of producing about 1,200 tonnes of rainbow trout annually, boosting Singapore's supply of locally farmed fish, Blue Aqua International, the shrimp aquaculture technology firm behind the new farm, said on Tuesday (Jan 11).
That figure is about a quarter of the current annual local farmed fish production.
From 2016 to 2019, local fish production rates were between 4,578 tonnes and 4,851 tonnes annually, while 2020 saw the production of about 3,960 tonnes, as farms adjusted their output owing to lower sales during the Covid-19 pandemic.

3,China to curb purchases of US farm goods in 2022 as ties fray: Fitch Solutions,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/china-to-curb-purchases-of-us-farm-goods-in-2022-as-ties-fray,"China may continue to limit soya bean and other agricultural purchases from the US as geopolitical tensions persist, the research company said in a note.
Fitch Solutions highlighted other key agribusiness themes in 2022, including soaring input costs and strained supply chains.
It said the US-China relationship poses a risk to logistics as escalating tensions could disrupt trade routes.
But soaring fertilizer and energy prices are seen as the greatest risk to grain prices this year, according to a Fitch poll.
This would likely reduce the production of key crops such as wheat and rice, as well as arabica coffee.","prices, 2022, solutions, ties, china, risk, purchases, share, soya, tensions, fray, curb, trade, production, farm, strained, soaring, goods, fitch"

5,Urban farms where you least expect them - at bus stops,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/veggies-at-bus-stops-to-increase-public-awareness-on-farming-sustainability,"SINGAPORE - Singapore plans to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030, but not many Singaporeans know much about the high-tech farms that produce them.
A new campaign by sovereign wealth fund GIC to raise the profile of urban farms in Singapore aims to change that, with seven bus stops islandwide sprouting vegetables such as kailan, butterhead lettuce and Chinese cabbage.
“It’s a nice change from the usual ads that no one really pays attention to, and it’s quite interesting to learn that Singapore has farms also,” said the Chinese national.
Another commuter, who wanted to be known only as Madam Ong, 61, said the display helped to improve the aesthetics of the bus stop at the Fu Lu Shou complex, where she was waiting to take a bus home.
She said: “We had to build a bespoke hydroponics system to sufficiently irrigate the crops planted at the bus stops and ensure that they had optimal growing conditions within the advertising box.","farming, stops, singapore, expect, street, urban, farms, vegetables, stop, vegetable, bus"

The Cabinet has also supported the budget for added hog surveillance, Mr Thanakorn said.
In the past three years, Thailand has been able to control the epidemic well and has not concealed information about the swine outbreak that has killed more than 500 million pigs in neighbouring Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, he said.
Prices could rise to 300 baht a kilogram ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations, when demand for pork rises.
The South-east Asian nation last Thursday banned exports of live pigs until April, in an effort to cool the price rally.","farm, prevent, inspections, thanakorn, swine, baht, pig, bangkok, reported, thailand, pork, expedite, pet, outbreak, fever, pigs"

10,India intensifies push for natural farming as it tries to reduce emissions,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/india-intensifies-push-for-natural-farming-as-it-tries-to-reduce-emissions,"KOLKATA - India is intensifying a push into natural farming, lured by a burgeoning market for organic produce and compelled by the need to reduce agriculture-related emissions as it strives to attain its net zero goal by 2070.
The government has endorsed a farming practice known as Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), which is built around soil mulching and aeration, besides the use of low-cost inputs such as cow dung and urine, jaggery, pulse flour and fruit pulp.
The government introduced a special scheme last year to support natural farming practices, including ZBNF.
More than 650,000 hectares spread across 11 states in India is currently under various forms of natural farming.
Among the key reasons for the government's growing interest in ZBNF and other natural farming schools is the ballooning cost of subsidising fertilisers.","farming, intensifies, india, natural, push, shift, rupees, zbnf, indias, support, fertilisers, emissions, tries, reduce, agriculture, sustainable"

Farmers will start vacating the protest sites from Saturday (Dec 11) after a victory march, he said.
The rollback has also signalled the government lacks the stomach to push through tough reforms when faced with popular resistance.
The three farm laws would have eased rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm crops.

In a rare retreat last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced and pushed through Parliament the repeal of three contentious laws that farmers claimed would let private companies control the country's agriculture sector.
Hundreds of farmers danced and celebrated the victory early on Saturday as they began removing roadblocks and dismantling thousands of makeshift homes along major highways.
The government said the laws were a necessary reform but farmers opposed the move, saying it would leave them at the mercy of big corporations.

The laws were rushed through Parliament in September last year and resulted in tens of thousands of farmers across north India taking to the streets in protests.
Last Friday, Mr Modi attempted to end the protracted stand-off by agreeing to roll back that legislation in the next session of Parliament, starting on Nov 29.
The laws, which had already been suspended by the Supreme Court in January, allowed farmers to sell crops directly to private firms instead of licensed middlemen at state-controlled markets.

Around 60 people share North Ronaldsay - an island just over 5 kilometres long, ringed by rocky beaches and turquoise waters off the north coast of mainland Britain - with the distinctive native sheep.
The unintended result: in summer the sheep can nibble on grass, but by winter eating the plentiful seaweed is their only means of survival.
Farm animals belch and fart methane gas which, though trivial sounding, is about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.
The seaweed diet of the Orkney sheep has an effect on their complex digestive system and appears to reduce the amount of methane produced.","farming, unique, offer, seaweed, diet, north, greener, hopes, winter, scientists, seaweedeating, methane, sheep, world, scottish, island"

The European Parliament and the EU's 27 governments must agree and countries would be responsible for enforcing the rules.
The animal advocacy movement succeeded in rattling the cage and planting the seeds of a new era,"" said Olga Kikou, head of campaign group Compassion in World Farming EU, and one of the citizens leading the petition.
Farmers will be able to receive EU subsidies to help them upgrade to new animal farming systems, the Commission said.","farming, end, european, eu, animals, cages, citizens, eus, hens, caged, animal, commission"

Undeterred after being called ""mad"" by botanical archaeologists at Bar Ilan, Dr Sallon showed them evidence of ancient seeds being germinated elsewhere.
With that and ""a lot of hassling"", she obtained five seeds and then approached Dr Solowey, based on Kibbutz Ketura, near Israel's border with Jordan.
Dr Solowey recounted how Dr Sallon sent her the ancient seeds from the fortress with the instruction to ""try to sprout them"".
Dr Solowey said she spent several months considering the best approach, before deciding to use an enzyme-based fertiliser while ruling out the use of any man-made chemicals.","ancient, israeli, bears, palm, fruit, solowey, seeds, dr, sallon, sprout, mad, species, revive, fortress, date, quest, dates"
