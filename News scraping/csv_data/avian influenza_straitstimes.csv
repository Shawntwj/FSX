That strain has caused a wave of outbreaks of bird flu in poultry across Europe and Asia.
Wild birds can transmit avian flu to each other or to poultry through direct contact and through their feathers or feces.
Prof Cardona said poultry producers need to make sure the virus cannot enter their barns.

The virus, Eurasian H5 avian influenza, was found in a wild duck that was hunted in Colleton County, in the southern part of South Carolina, officials said.
One case of the H7N3 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was found in a commercial turkey flock in South Carolina in 2020.
Wild birds can carry avian flu without showing symptoms and transmit it to poultry through their feathers or faeces.
In 2015, an outbreak of avian flu led to the deaths of about 50 million US chickens and turkeys.","wild, south, eurasian, case, influenza, h5, bird, pathogenic, 2016, highly, finds, avian, flu, duck, poultry",Pest and disease outbreaks

3,02/2021,"MOSCOW • Russia said its scientists had detected the world's first case of transmission of the H5N8 strain of avian flu from birds to humans and had alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO).

In televised remarks on Saturday, the head of Russia's health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, Ms Anna Popova, said scientists at the Vektor laboratory had isolated the strain's genetic material from seven workers at a poultry farm in southern Russia, where an outbreak was recorded among the birds in December.

The workers did not suffer any serious health consequences, she added. They are believed to have caught the virus from poultry on the farm.

""Under the current situation in Japan, we do not believe that there is any possibility of avian influenza being transmitted to humans through the consumption of chicken meat or eggs,"" the ministry said.
But an increase in the number of people in China getting infected from bird flu this year is turning into a source of concern among epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Last winter, Japan had its worst season of winter flu on farms yet, with more than 3 million chickens culled and a quarter of the country's prefectures affected.
Japan has an egg-laying flock of around 185 million hens and a broiler population of 138 million, according to the ministry of agriculture.","season, culls, chickens, influenza, world, bird, outbreak, reports, winter, japan, 143000, million, ministry, avian, flu",Pest and disease outbreaks

Dr Eloit stressed, however, that most countries had learned to contain outbreaks and transmissions to humans would be sporadic as bird flu is usually passed through close contact.

The number of people in China infected with H5N6 bird flu this year has jumped, raising concern among experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people.

The virus was discovered in samples collected from wild birds last week in Cheonan-si, Chungcheongnam-do, about 84km central west of capital Seoul, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.
The ministry said it has ramped up prevention measures to contain a wider spread of bird flu and issued a highly pathogenic avian influenza warning as there are increased risks the virus will spread.
""This is a serious situation where the pollutant can flow from the migratory bird land to the farm though various routes,"" Agriculture Ministry Kim Hyeon-soo said in a statement, urging the thorough implementation of quarantine measures at farms, such as the daily disinfecting of farmyards.

""Most live bird markets will eventually disappear, but it will be difficult to shut down all the markets across the country,"" said Ms Pan Chenjun, a senior livestock analyst with Rabobank.
Research from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US has shown that live poultry markets are a major source of human infection with avian influenza and their permanent closure should be considered to stop the occurrence of epidemics.","demand, live, country, resurface, bird, sales, coronavirus, consumption, meat, pork, poultry, chinas, markets, chicken",Pest and disease outbreaks
