Within the workforce, middle-aged workers also still account for the majority of those who experienced income deterioration.
A persistent increase was also observed in the unemployment rate of middle-aged workers.
These findings suggest that middle-aged workers will continue to face challenges, and therefore require sustained policy support, DBS said.","customers, policy, recovery, middleaged, group, struggling, dbs, sporeans, support, workers, financial, experienced, cent, lowerincome, income, amid, covid19",Man-Made Disaster

The growth rate was the lowest registered in all of the country's seven previous official population surveys, dating to 1953.
Mr Ning said that there were 12 million births last year, and the country's fertility rate was 1.3.

Britain requires banks to ""ring-fence"" the retail arms of their operations to shield them from any problems in their riskier, investment banking arms.
Proprietary trading refers to banks buying and selling stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than on behalf of a client.
The review was called for by the finance ministry and the independent panel is chaired by City veteran Keith Skeoch.
Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec 31 means it no longer has to comply with the bloc's financial rules, freeing it up to tailor regulation to UK lenders.","reviews, wider, trading, changes, sector, britain, review, core, independent, banks, financial, rules, brexit, uk, light, banking",Man-Made Disaster

233,06/2020,"LONDON • European Central Bank (ECB) officials are drawing up a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The project, which comes as Europe mobilises trillions of euros to bolster the region's economy, is aimed at shielding commercial banks from any second fallout from the crisis, if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to repay loans.

One of the people familiar with the plan said the ECB had set up a task force to look at the idea of a ""bad bank"" to warehouse unpaid euro debt and that work on the plan had accelerated in recent weeks.

The ECB declined to comment on whether it was working on a bad bank scheme. The amount of debt in the euro zone that is considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid already stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, according to official statistics.

That is set to rise as the outbreak squeezes borrowers and could even double to one trillion euros, weighing on already fragile banks and hindering new lending, the people familiar with the ECB plans said.

While the idea for a euro zone bad bank was discussed and shelved over two years ago, the ECB, under president Christine Lagarde, has consulted banks and European Union officials about a scheme in recent weeks, one of the people said.

One blueprint under discussion would involve the European Stability Mechanism, an EU institution which can provide financial assistance to euro zone countries or lenders, standing in as guarantor for the bad bank, the people said.

The bad bank would then issue bonds which commercial banks would buy in exchange for portfolios of unpaid loans, neutralising the virus shock for Europe's lenders. The banks could then lodge those bonds with the ECB as collateral for central bank funding, one of the people said.

Major European commercial banks could be called on to join forces to underpin the scheme, the second person said.

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to rise to the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, from November's 49.9.
The relative strength in the Caixin PMI tallied with an official survey released last Friday that showed China's factory activity had edged up.
Factory output increased at the fastest pace in a year, the private survey showed, helped by easing price pressures.

If the global sourcing networks for such inputs undergo an unexpected and unfavourable reconfiguration, there may be a painful economic adjustment needed here in coming years.
Travel curbs have also cut down the supply of workers, worsening the increasing skills disparities and mismatch, pushing up wages as another source of higher business costs.
Also, labour force participation rates have been falling worldwide in ageing economies like Singapore.
Such longer-term structural impacts of the pandemic are a source of concern for both policymakers and companies, especially those with a large global footprint.","global, reset, supply, spore, singapore, pandemic, weather, concern, worldwide, recent, disruptions, chain, source, economic, set, rates, covid19",Man-Made Disaster

Though more than half of the 22 million jobs lost last spring have been regained, a new surge of infections has prompted shutdowns and layoffs that have hit the leisure and hospitality industries especially hard, dealing a setback to the recovery.

The latest evidence came on Thursday when the Labour Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, exceeding one million for the first time since July.

Just days earlier, the government announced that employers had shed 140,000 jobs last month, the first net decline in employment since last spring, with restaurants, bars and hotels recording steep losses.

""We're in a deep economic hole, and we're digging in the wrong direction,"" said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao.

In the first quarter of this year, private home prices rose 2.9 per cent, the steepest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2018.

The Government must act promptly to maintain a stable and sustainable property market for Singaporeans.

One measure it could consider would be to tighten the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limit further. This would have multiple benefits.

First, the current interest rate environment can lead to a significant mispricing of assets, and tightening the TDSR would reduce the risk of Singaporeans overleveraging to purchase properties.

This, in turn, would lower the systemic risk that may be posed to the financial system by overleveraged individuals, given continued uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and the direction of interest rates.

Second, reducing the amount of capital locked up in property allows it to be deployed to more productive uses. This capital could be used instead to invest in businesses to help them grow.

Battery providers and electronics firms also stand to gain as these companies may benefit from the increase in the number of EVs being manufactured, and therefore higher demand for the technology powering them.

In contrast, the traditional auto parts industry may lose out in the longer term as pure EV penetration increases. Largely, this is a function of the increased simplicity of EVs versus ICE cars.

Chief among these should no doubt be fintech investments (Spike in investments into S'pore-based fintech firms, June 22) coming hot on the heels of the increasing infatuation with fintech (Coronavirus: More consumers, companies embracing tech, May 10) and last year's stellar growth in fintech investments (S'pore fintech investments more than doubled to $1.2b last year, Feb 21).
Thought leaders suggest that achieving this balance involves calibrating the competing goals of supporting the growth of fintech with the regulatory goals of financial stability and consumer protection, and the key will be to adopt innovative and smarter digital regulatory systems.
This means going beyond mere adoption of technology to digitalise regulatory, compliance and reporting processes, to developing strong information technology capabilities - including in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.
This would allow for the analysis of relevant leading indicators such as those of financial instability and regulatory non-compliance, to provide regulators with greater predictive ex ante capabilities to pre-emptively fight fraud.","tech, forum, spore, keeping, important, singapore, growth, financial, investments, reporting, pace, goals, regulatory, fintech, technology, covid19",Man-Made Disaster

The Senior Minister also stressed the high stakes involved for Singapore in how it responds to crises.
""Singapore can hold its own in the world only if we are strong, successful and united at home,"" he said.
Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, outlined three aspects of Singapore's resilience in dealing with Covid-19 - in its crisis response, economic resilience and social resilience.
First, in terms of its crisis response, Mr Teo said Singapore had to scale up its capacity to deal with infected patients rapidly.","shows, resilience, reserves, singapore, building, hean, pandemic, strong, singapores, senior, importance, stressed, minister, chee, teo, world, crisis, covid19",Man-Made Disaster

Powell was repeatedly asked how the Fed could mitigate the impacts of such racial inequality.

While there is little evidence so far that investors, large companies or expat residents are rushing to move their money, the emergence of China's national security Bill and the United States response that it can no longer certify Hong Kong's political autonomy is stoking concern.

The developments come after Hong Kong in the past year was pushed into a deep economic crisis triggered by political upheaval and, since late January, the coronavirus outbreak.

The head of state summoned Mr Draghi for talks on Wednesday at noon (7pm Singapore time) after hearing that efforts to salvage the collapsed coalition of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had failed.
Mr Draghi is widely credited with pulling the euro zone back from the brink of collapse in 2012, pledging to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the single European currency.
Mr Draghi made no immediate comment on the presidential summons and it was not initially clear which parties in the deeply fractured parliament would support an administration he headed.
While Forza Italia was widely expected to rally to Draghi's side, Brothers of Italy indicated that it would remain in opposition.","save, italys, president, crisis, calls, chief, european, support, mario, mattarella, draghi, country, coalition, italy, party, mr, execb, administration, economic",Man-Made Disaster

Japanese carmakers have scrapped plans to expand in Britain, in part because Brexit undermines the country's virtues as a hub for European trade.
The deadlock only deepened on Monday (April 1), as Britain's Parliament failed to reach consensus on the latest Brexit proposals.

885,03/2019,"LONDON • Britain's vote to leave the European Union has already come at a cost, regardless of where Brexit goes from here. Some of the damage is tangible, such as jobs, investment and capital; some of it less so, like international clout and talent.

Prime Minister Theresa May's defeat again in Parliament on Tuesday leaves Britain needing to delay Brexit. The EU, though, must agree to it and officials in Brussels have warned that there will be no further renegotiation.

Meanwhile, the threat of economic pain still looms over the country. And the political impasse remains as entrenched as ever, even after Parliament also voted to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.

Here's a look at where the biggest impact has been so far.

THE ECONOMY

The vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has cost the United Kingdom about £800 million (S$1.44 billion) per week, or about 2 per cent of total economic output, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said last month.

Optimism among firms is at its lowest in seven years, according to Lloyds Banking Group, and businesses have recorded the longest continuous decline in investment since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Not all of this investment will be recovered even if there is a smooth exit process, the central bank warns.

The pound is down more than 10 per cent against the euro since Britain voted to leave the EU. That has increased the cost of imported goods and services, boosting inflation and eroding purchasing power for consumers. British exporters, meanwhile, have failed to take advantage of the weaker pound to grow their market share.

The seizure was made in accordance to the Airport Authority Ordinance, the government body said in an email on Tuesday (Dec 17), citing a section of the rules that addresses overdue charges.

The Twitter co-founder said in a tweet that Block, formerly known as Square, is ""officially building an open Bitcoin mining system"", following through on an idea floated publicly late last year.
In November, Mr Dorsey announced his departure from the social media platform, allowing him to concentrate on his digital payments firm as it expands into cryptocurrency.
Block changed its name from Square late last year to denote a broader mission that includes blockchain and economic empowerment.

996,08/2020,"That is why we have made a concerted effort to value a wide range of talent. Schools and institutes of higher learning admit students through yardsticks other than academic results. The Public Service Commission has widened its catchment of scholars.

Employers are encouraged to hire people based on skills, with the public service taking the lead. Political parties are fielding candidates who took different life paths and have diverse talents and strengths.

This is also why we must continue to invest heavily in education and training, from the earliest years of childhood through the schooling years. We are developing many pathways, so that young Singaporeans can achieve their fullest potential regardless of their starting point.

And through the next bound of SkillsFuture, we will enable every worker to upskill and progress throughout their career, beyond their initial qualifications. Employers must support lifelong learning as the new norm. Society must value people for what they contribute, in every job and every role.

Building a fair and just society goes beyond government actions. It requires the support and participation of all Singaporeans. It turns on how we look after our most vulnerable members, such as helping students from disadvantaged families through Uplift and KidStart, providing training and job opportunities for people with disabilities, and bridging the digital divide for our seniors.

We have made progress over the last decade, and we will do much more in this term of Government to see our people through this crisis and beyond. The more closely knit we are as a people, the further we can move ahead as a nation.

STRENGTHENING OUR SINGAPOREAN IDENTITY

In the longer term, the key to Singapore's success lies in our sense of shared identity. Singapore can endure and secure her place in history only if Singaporeans feel passionately about our country, and put our hearts and souls into making this a better home.

Since independence, we have gradually built a distinctive Singaporean culture and identity. Regardless of race, language and religion, we all think of ourselves as Singaporeans. You can see this in our attitudes, memories and experiences; it is in our arts and heritage, and the way we cheer for Team Singapore together. You see it in the way we can gladly identify one another in an unfamiliar foreign land, and the way we have each other's backs in a crisis.

These are emotional ties that are strengthened over the years.

There is still much more to do to strengthen the sense of togetherness in our society. We must start young and shape the multicultural instincts in our children early in life; our approaches and methods must therefore evolve with the outlook and attitudes of the young. We must then sustain this mindset across our communities and workplaces.

We must also recognise that larger forces are at play that test our solidarity and pull us in different directions. The social media has amplified contending voices and views. We are more exposed than ever to causes, attitudes and values from other societies that may not be relevant to our social context, but will influence us nonetheless.

1002,06/2019,"More than 252,000 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) are working for an estimated 200,000 families in Singapore.

Many FDWs do have financial problems back home.

When the family of an FDW experiences a financial crisis, she has little option but to resort to borrowing.

Besides borrowing from friends, the only viable option is to take a loan from a moneylending company and, regretfully, some borrow from unlicensed moneylenders.

Most FDWs dare not borrow from their employers for fear that the latter might terminate their employment.

FDWs we interviewed shared their concerns that employers may perceive them to be not mentally sound to do their work properly in their current state.

Though the repayment of loans by FDWs to facilitate their employment here is one of the reasons for the FDWs to be saddled with debt, it is by no means the main reason for them to borrow.

From our interaction with FDWs, the main reason stems from the inability of many FDWs to meet the financial needs of their families back home.

More so when there is a crisis such as sickness or natural disaster. The crisis situation is more pronounced when the FDW is the main or sole breadwinner.

We have to bear in mind that FDWs' contribution to our economy cannot be taken for granted.

Their presence frees parents to pursue their careers and enables all to be economically active as our children, seniors and homes are being looked after.

We can do more to help them. Proper education should be made available and accessible to FDWs to help them understand the consequences of borrowing.

Travel-related and consumer-facing service industries such as accommodation and retail trade, as well as both air and land transport, have been most affected by the pandemic.
Employment in these industries, which collectively employ close to one-fifth of Singapore's workforce, was already seeing weak growth prior to the outbreak, the MAS noted.
Across the economy, firms are likely to reduce labour costs via a combination of wage and headcount reductions as revenues shrink, it said.
But overall, the sudden shock to the Singapore economy - forecast to contract by between 1 per cent and 4 per cent - is still likely to cause an increase in retrenchments and overall unemployment.","economy, sectors, sector, singapore, firms, layoffs, workers, jobs, hit, wages, retail, risk, overall, recreation, industries, mas, affected, likely",Man-Made Disaster

S&P affirmed Australia's prized rating but said a downgrade was possible within the next two years if the economic damage from the Covid-19 outbreak is more severe or prolonged than it currently expects.
This would cause a ""substantial deterioration of the government's fiscal headroom at the 'AAA' rating level,"" S&P said in a statement.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the outlook downgrade was ""a reminder of the importance of maintaining our commitment to medium term fiscal sustainability.""
Some fund managers said Wednesday's outlook downgrade was unlikely to raise the government's borrowing costs by much though it could hurt Australian companies whose ratings are dependent on the sovereign rating.","affirms, rating, sp, ratings, fiscal, funds, sovereign, australias, aaa, governments, cuts, trillion, economic, outlook, negative, downgrade",Man-Made Disaster

With no end to the increasingly violent protests in sight, analysts say the slump could be long and deep, with gross domestic product seen shrinking further this quarter and well into next year.
The financial and trade centre was already under strong pressure from the prolonged tariff war between Washington and Beijing, but the increasingly violent demonstrations, which have gone on for more than five months, have delivered a decisive blow.
August retail sales were the worst on record - down 23 per cent from a year earlier - while September's plunged 18.3 per cent.

Economically, older workers are able to spend more of their income to drive a consumption economy, as they are no longer scrimping and saving to pay for their homes or to bring up kids.
Older workers can also contribute to the economy by working longer in the jobs for which they are trained, bringing greater consistency to their jobs, and resulting in greater stability in the workplace.

It is yet unclear if a 6.9-magnitude earthquake on Friday night off the coast of West Java had anything to do with the power outage.
But PLN admitted the cause of Sunday's big power failure was a technical fault at its transmission circuits on the Ungaran to Pemalang power line in Central Java, causing voltage drops within the power networks in Jakarta and western part of Java.
As demand for electricity has grown, the PLN transmission system seems to have cracked under the weight of ever-heavier power loads.
The big power failure certainly has caused big losses as Jakarta and its surrounding towns and West Java hosts almost 60 percent of the country's manufacturing plants and are home to more than 100 million people.","power, electricity, western, failure, west, intervention, post, big, jakarta, pln, transmission, java, emblematic",Man-Made Disaster

Two decades ago, concerns about denuded mountains, polluted rivers and devastating floods along the Yangtze River made worse by damaged watersheds prompted the communist government to begin restricting commercial logging in the nation's forests.

Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on health care systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage, which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship.
Globally, the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in ten years, with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing.

The EFL, which represents the three divisions below the Premier League, last month rejected a £50 million (S$89 million) offer from the top flight for League One and League Two clubs, saying that it wanted a deal which covered all of its teams.
Despite the financial crisis, Premier League clubs spent over £1 billion on buying players in the close-season transfer window.
However, Masters defended the spending as necessary to maintain a competitive edge.
The British government is holding back on any intervention and has called on the Premier League to take the lead in helping out clubs in the lower reaches.","clubs, efl, rescue, committed, million, willing, continue, teams, package, offer, transfer, epl, masters, premier, league",Man-Made Disaster

The general account spending requests for the fiscal year that begins next April exceeds the previous high of 105 trillion yen sought for the current year.

The amount received a boost from demand related to urgent steps to contain the virus spread and ease the pain from the economic fallout, which has triggered Japan's deepest recession on record.

State Minister of Finance Wataru Ito told reporters yesterday: ""We remain committed to achieving both economic revival and fiscal reform, and we'll overcome the coronavirus crisis to pass the future on to the next generation.""

The first budget under Mr Suga underscored a struggle for the heavily indebted government to curb snowballing debt that is more than twice the size of Japan's US$5 trillion (S$6.8 trillion) economy.

Many submitted requests did not specify the amount of spending, leaving room to increase the overall figure as the Finance Ministry reviews the requests and finalises the amount in late December.

Highlighting the bulging costs of supporting an ageing population and financing debt, budget requests for social security and debt servicing came to 32.9 trillion yen and 25.5 trillion yen respectively, or more than half the overall budget.

As leader of a key party in the previous Pakatan Harapan government, Anwar waited patiently for Mahathir to fulfil a pledge to eventually name him prime minister.

Mahathir kept pushing back the date, and soon the government unravelled.

On Wednesday, Anwar said he was ready to replace Muhyiddin, who could only command a majority of a few lawmakers since he took office in March.

While the prime minister denounced the push for power, Umno leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said some members of the government's biggest party were now backing Anwar.

On its face, it would seem odd for Anwar to link up with Umno given he previously called for the end of affirmative action policies it championed.

He's also blasted the party for corruption related to former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was found guilty of corruption last month and sentenced to 12 years in prison in the first trial over the 1MDB scandal to reach a conclusion.

FAIR REPRESENTATION

But Anwar has shown signs of softening his stance in recent years, and made clear in his statement Wednesday (Sept 23) that the majority of lawmakers backing him were ""Malay and Muslim.""

He promised ""fair representation"" for all races, without naming ethnic Indians and Chinese who hold key posts in his own party and coalition.

""We are committed to uphold the principles of the constitution that recognises the position of Islam, the sovereignty of the Malay rulers and uphold the position of the Malay language as the official language and the special position of the Malays and Bumiputra as well as give assurance to defend the rights of all races,"" he said in a statement.

1489,07/2020,"MOSCOW • Tens of thousands of people protested in Russia's far east last Saturday in a rare display of opposition to President Vladimir Putin in the country's vast hinterland, chanting ""Putin Resign"" and demanding the release of a regional governor arrested this past week on suspicion of multiple murders.

The protests in Khabarovsk, a city bordering China, and several other towns were the largest in Russia's usually somnolent provinces in many years, rivalling or even exceeding in size demonstrations last summer in Moscow, the main centre of opposition to the Kremlin.

Unlike street protests in Moscow, which the authorities can easily discredit as the work of a privileged metropolitan elite led astray by Russia's enemies in the West, the outburst of anger against Mr Putin in a hardscrabble region nearly 6,400km east of the capital presented an unusual and potentially more troublesome challenge.

The protests in towns across Khabarovsk Krai, a region that stretches from the frontier with China to the Arctic along the Pacific Ocean, followed the arrest last Thursday of the region's popular governor Sergei Furgal. He is one of Russia's few provincial leaders not affiliated with political forces entirely controlled by the Kremlin.

Mr Alexei Navalny, a Moscow","Protests rock Russian far east, with calls for Putin to resign",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/protests-rock-russian-far-east-with-calls-for-putin-to-resign-0,"Videos showed festive scenes of protesters, both young and old, waving signs in support of the arrested governor and chanting ""Freedom for Furgal"", ""Moscow Get Out"" and ""Putin Step Down"".
Demonstrations were also reported in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, an important industrial centre, Solnechny and other towns in Khabarovsk Krai.
His arrest only now is seen as politically motivated, the latest heavy-handed strike by the authorities after an allegedly rigged national plebiscite on constitutional amendments paved the way for Mr Putin to become president for life.
More than 78 per cent of Russian voters earlier this month endorsed amendments that allow Mr Putin to crash through term limits previously mandated by the Constitution and stay in power until at least 2036.
However, few commentators expect the street protests to snowball nationwide and force Mr Putin to step down, not least because the Kremlin controls an immense security apparatus adept at crushing demonstrations.","calls, khabarovsk, far, east, protests, rock, moscow, towns, furgal, resign, mr, governor, russian, step, russias, putin",Man-Made Disaster

Another contributing factor was that the PAP's online campaign did not connect well with voters, Mr Wong noted.

President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's signing last year of a five-page order for a permanent moratorium on the issuance of new permits for businesses in primary forests and peatlands covering 66 million ha will be toothless without strong enforcement.
But reality in the field in Sumatra and Kalimantan could be 'business as usual' without strong oversight by central and local government authorities.
It is therefore imperative that the central and local administrations strengthen cooperation with large companies managing millions of ha of pulpwood and oil palm estates in Sumatra and Kalimantan to enforce preventive measures against forest fires during the May-October dry season.
However, plantation companies cannot simply erect walls around their concessions by procuring equipment and training their own firefighting personnel and rapid-response teams.","local, close, plantation, kalimantan, ha, forest, deforestation, eye, season, fires, sumatra, post, current, million, jakarta, dry, peatland, alerts",Man-Made Disaster

Costs for companies will rise as firms have to ensure that safe distancing measures are in place.

The world has come into this moment with divisions among its great powers and incompetence at the highest levels of government of terrifying proportions. We will pass through this, but into what?

As recently as January, the IMF had no idea of what was about to hit, partly because Chinese officials had failed to inform one another, let alone the rest of the world. Now we are in the middle of a pandemic with vast consequences. But much remains unclear. One important uncertainty is how myopic leaders will respond to this global threat.

Another roughly 80,000 have been fired, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on company statements and data provided by the national authorities.

1776,01/2020,"HONG KONG • Hong Kong's protests are spurring more asset managers from the city to ask about opening offices in Singapore, according to consultants.

While the unrest is not the only factor, the development adds to signs that Singapore is picking up business in part due to the protests. The list includes a private equity gathering that is moving to Singapore this year, family office advisers getting calls about clients looking into the logistics for moves, and Hong Kong parents eyeing Singapore schools.

Global valuation and corporate finance adviser Duff & Phelps has seen a rise in applications from Hong Kong asset managers to open offices in Singapore and apply to do regulated business, according to Ms Koh Sin Yee, director of compliance and regulatory consulting.

Law firm Shook Lin & Bok has seen a ""surge in inquiries and actual instructions"" from Hong Kong firms looking to set up fund management companies in Singapore since August, according to Mr Tan Woon Hum, partner and head of trust, asset and wealth management practice.

""We have not seen a sudden surge of interest of this nature from one particular city except during the global financial crisis,"" said Mr Tan, who has almost two decades of specialised funds management practice in Singapore.

Protests in Hong Kong have dragged on for over six months, with violent clashes between protesters and the police fuelling uncertainty over the city's future. Hong Kong's government forecasts that the economy contracted 1.3 per cent last year. Any acceleration in asset managers actually moving some of their business from Hong Kong could add to the economic woes.

To be sure, many of the steps are preliminary and any actual shifts of business or staff to Singapore could require more time to acquire licences. And even before the protests, there had been interest in Singapore from funds in various cities for a variety of reasons, according to market watchers.

""In the past half year, the total number of fund management companies licensed and registered by the MAS grew by almost 9 per cent from 820 as of May 31, 2019, to 892 as of Jan 8, 2020,"" a spokesman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said. This compared with 780 managers as of Dec 31, 2018, the spokesman added.

CONTINGENCY PLANS

When it comes to the Hong Kong firms that are looking to set up offices in recent months, they are generally of the size where they would look to have another office in Asia, but the protests are an added impetus, according to Duff & Phelps.

""The protests are a factor that accelerates the decision to open a Singapore office, but are not the sole driver of Hong Kong firms applying to do regulated business in Singapore,"" said Ms Koh.

Hong Kong funds are putting contingency plans in place and some of them have asked their staff to spend time in Singapore during ""crazy"" weeks to minimise disruption, according to Mr Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates in Hong Kong.

While a Singapore minister warned last year that Hong Kong",Hong Kong funds eye Singapore offices to dodge protest fallout,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/hong-kong-funds-eye-singapore-offices-to-dodge-protest-fallout-0,"HONG KONG • Hong Kong's protests are spurring more asset managers from the city to ask about opening offices in Singapore, according to consultants.

Exports, a key driver of economic growth, are now expected to shrink 3.3 per cent this year, compared with a 1 per cent fall seen earlier.
Next year's exports are expected to rise by a smaller 0.5 per cent, rather than 1.7 per cent.

In the chaos, a police media liaison officer was hit in the leg by an arrow shot by a protester and needed treatment at a hospital. Another officer had a small steel ball hit his visor, police said, but he was not wounded.

The violence at PolyU prompted police to warn that it had become a riot and that anyone who remained on campus or helped the protesters may be liable to the offence of taking part in a riot. In an urgent notice sent to its students, staff and alumni, PolyU said that while it understood students' concerns about the social conditions in Hong Kong, calm and sensibility must prevail when they fight for anything, public broadcaster RTHK reported. The university also condemned the illegal acts of the radical protesters.

Elsewhere, police fired tear gas to try to break up protesters in Nathan Road in the Kowloon district of Mong Kok. Protesters occupied a number of roads in the area and built barricades with rubbish. They also hurled bricks and petrol bombs at officers.

1807,11/2019,"Americans don't want to run the world. They haven't for a long time. And with each passing year, there are fewer Americans old enough to remember the Cold War, to say nothing of World War II. The reluctance of the US as a superpower creates a global vacuum of leadership. But no one is stepping up to take that role in the way that, more than a century ago, America emerged just as the sun began to set on the British Empire.

Europe remains profoundly preoccupied, particularly over economic issues dividing north and south, and political issues dividing east and west. And while Mr Xi has declared a new era for China in the world, China's leadership remains fundamentally cautious when it comes to accepting heavy international burdens.

That's why, when it comes to international leadership, Beijing will not soon become any more reliable a provider of public goods than Washington. And why a future crisis will be so hard to manage.

FALLOUT FOR GLOBALISATION

Then there is the impact of geopolitical recession on globalisation itself.

Globalisation has changed our understanding of how things are made and how we might live. Around the world, we celebrate our national holidays with fireworks made in China. The customer service calls we make to fix our computers are answered in India. Our cars are made from parts that come from dozens of countries. We are all globally integrated. And, until recently, politics hasn't played a big part in these processes. That's no longer true.

There is no longer a global free market. China, soon to be the world's largest economy, practises state capitalism, a system that allows government officials to ensure that economic growth ultimately serves political and national interests.

The success of this system for China and the Chinese Communist Party is undeniable. The good news for the rest of us is that Chinese growth has supported global growth. Crucially, the hybrid global economy it has created does not end globalisation. Both free market and state capitalist systems still enable goods and capital to move around the world.

1866,08/2019,"HONG KONG • Standard Chartered Bank is targeting to grow its private banking assets by 50 per cent to about US$100 billion (S$139 billion) in three to five years' time.

It aims to hire dozens of bankers in Hong Kong and Singapore towards that goal, a senior executive of the lender said.

The moves show StanChart has big growth ambitions for the private banking unit that had, until recently, weighed on the lender's earnings, with its small size stoking speculation that it would be put under review for possible divestment.

The lender will recruit 30 to 40 private bankers every year in the next two to three years to add to its roughly 300 existing relationship managers, and the bulk of the additions will be in Hong Kong and Singapore, said Mr Didier von Daeniken, StanChart's global head for private banking and wealth management.

1912,06/2019,"When the girls got to Lahore, they reportedly found that the men were operating a brothel under the guise of a marriage bureau.

The men had faked everything including their religion. Sadly, as we hear of many other cases, the story seems fairly typical though the details can vary.

The case of Rabia Kanwal that was reported in the New York Times involved a woman and her family who were lied to.

Her husband said that he was Muslim and was a wealthy farmer.

According to Ms Kanwal, she was then flown to China and ended up in Hunan province after a short stop in Urumqi in Xinjiang province.

There she was surprised to find that her husband was not the wealthy man he had pretended to be but a poor duck farmer.

Ms Kanwal said she wanted to leave, something she was eventually able to do with the help of the Pakistani embassy.

When the Times talked to her husband, he said he was rich and claimed that he had only become Muslim on paper for the purposes of marrying her.

In yet another variation on trafficking, sometimes the women report actually being taken to China where they are sold into prostitution.

Pakistani marriage brokers are also allegedly working and arranging marriages between girls of poor families and Chinese men who are coming to Pakistan to work on various projects.

The men apparently stay in various rental properties until the marriage takes place and then leave with the women.

In raids carried out by the FIA, several Chinese individuals have been arrested on charges of operating brothels or trafficking women.

In recent weeks, the media attention garnered by the issue has led Chinese officials to denounce allegations that Pakistani brides were being trafficked to China.

Along with the statements, videos of Pakistani women married to Chinese men were released.

In the videos, the women who may or may not have actually been married to the Chinese men declare in Urdu how happy they are.

The men do not say anything at all but stay in the frame the entire time.

Whether or not the videos are authentic, it is true that China's woman deficit has previously led to women being trafficked from other regional countries, such as Myanmar.

In a statement, the rights watchdog Human Rights Watch also attested that the pattern of trafficking appeared to be very similar.

There is no doubt that the Chinese government needs to do much more to crack down on this problem by monitoring Chinese men who pass through immigration with Pakistani brides.

At the same time, the Pakistani government and Pakistani society in general also need to give some serious thought to what they expect out of their exchange with China.

It is sad that closer relations between the two countries, with men from China coming to Pakistan to work on the Belt and Road Initiative, has created a situation where women find themselves vulnerable to trafficking.

But it is not very surprising, given the fact that many of the Chinese workers come from a society where not everyone can marry (especially because of the shortage of women).

The result of all this is the victimisation of unsuspecting Pakistani women.

Beyond the human trafficking dimension, Pakistanis also need to think long and hard about their terms of cultural exchange with China.

It is quite one thing to accept Chinese money and laud Chinese projects, it is quite another to embrace a culture that is qualitatively different from Pakistan's own.

Until now, this is probably the least considered aspect of Pakistan's turn towards China.

Unless it is attended to, women will continue to bear the brunt of the two governments looking away every time they are exploited.

It is about time that both governments worked together to come up with an effective strategy to stop this practice.

1914,06/2019,"Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May shipments from the world's largest exporter to have fallen 3.8 per cent from a year earlier, after a contraction of 2.7 per cent in April.

While China is not as dependent on exports as in the past, they still account for nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product.

Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply last month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.

Mr Trump on May 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of Chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining US$300 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on US goods.

Mr Trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Group of 20 leaders' summit later this month, but analysts such as Capital Economics believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding, as both sides appear to be digging in for a long battle.

Trade sanctions are spreading from goods to services, Capital Economics noted last week, with China issuing a warning to citizens about risks of travelling in the US and American lawmakers pushing to tighten visas for Chinese students.

Of the US$1 trillion that China has allocated to BRI projects, US$72 billion is envisaged for CPEC.

And third, there is a need to strengthen cooperation between China and international organisations under the Belt and Road framework in order to enhance overall multilateral cooperation.
There is also a need to open a global project website to issue tenders and invite international bids for Belt and Road projects.","initiative, chinas, development, road, ahead, partners, international, bank, bri, belt, billion, organisations, china",Man-Made Disaster

Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez on Monday said the blackout that began in the early afternoon was the result of an attack on Venezuela's main hydroelectric Guri dam, which had affected three major transmission lines.

Mr Rodriguez did not explicitly blame Monday's outage on any particular individual or group.

Electricity experts say the outages are the result of inadequate maintenance and incompetent management of the power grid since the late President Hugo Chávez nationalised the sector in 2007.

The mainland population registered its lowest growth rate on record in the past decade, increasing by 5.38 per cent and bringing the total population to 1.412 billion in 2020, results from the once-in-a-decade census showed on Tuesday (May 11).
The growth rate was the lowest registered in all of the country's seven previous official population surveys, dating to 1953.
Mr Ning said that there were 12 million births last year, and the country's fertility rate was 1.3.
This is far lower than the 18 million and 17 million births registered in 2016 and 2017 respectively after the decades-long one-child policy was abolished.","registered, hand, serious, million, rate, results, population, growth, census, births, experts, cent, closer, lowest, demographic, china, ning, crisis",Man-Made Disaster

Britain requires banks to ""ring-fence"" the retail arms of their operations to shield them from any problems in their riskier, investment banking arms.
Proprietary trading refers to banks buying and selling stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than on behalf of a client.
The review was called for by the finance ministry and the independent panel is chaired by City veteran Keith Skeoch.
Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec 31 means it no longer has to comply with the bloc's financial rules, freeing it up to tailor regulation to UK lenders.","reviews, wider, trading, changes, sector, britain, review, core, independent, banks, financial, rules, brexit, uk, light, banking",Man-Made Disaster

More banks are getting buyers in coastal areas to make bigger down payments - often as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price, up from the traditional 20 per cent - a sign that lenders have awakened to climate dangers and want to put less of their own money at risk.","buyers, washington, seas, institution, american, climate, using, unsellable, unlivable, threaten, cent, transforming, mortgage, rising, 30year, payments, walk",Man-Made Disaster

2248,06/2020,"LONDON • European Central Bank (ECB) officials are drawing up a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The project, which comes as Europe mobilises trillions of euros to bolster the region's economy, is aimed at shielding commercial banks from any second fallout from the crisis, if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to repay loans.

One of the people familiar with the plan said the ECB had set up a task force to look at the idea of a ""bad bank"" to warehouse unpaid euro debt and that work on the plan had accelerated in recent weeks.

The ECB declined to comment on whether it was working on a bad bank scheme. The amount of debt in the euro zone that is considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid already stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, according to official statistics.

That is set to rise as the outbreak squeezes borrowers and could even double to one trillion euros, weighing on already fragile banks and hindering new lending, the people familiar with the ECB plans said.

While the idea for a euro zone bad bank was discussed and shelved over two years ago, the ECB, under president Christine Lagarde, has consulted banks and European Union officials about a scheme in recent weeks, one of the people said.

One blueprint under discussion would involve the European Stability Mechanism, an EU institution which can provide financial assistance to euro zone countries or lenders, standing in as guarantor for the bad bank, the people said.

The bad bank would then issue bonds which commercial banks would buy in exchange for portfolios of unpaid loans, neutralising the virus shock for Europe's lenders. The banks could then lodge those bonds with the ECB as collateral for central bank funding, one of the people said.

Major European commercial banks could be called on to join forces to underpin the scheme, the second person said.

Retirement is not an option for Mr Quan, not while he remains passionate about growing his business. Even if the option were on the table, he believes his relatively simple lifestyle should not be a huge financial strain.

By and large, it seems Mr Quan has his financial planning in order. His family has comprehensive insurance coverage, and funding for his children's education is more or less covered by educational endowment plans bought when his kids were very young. He has also greatly benefited from investing in stocks during the depths of the past two crises and has since seen his investment funds grow substantially in the subsequent market upswing.

A combination of business and investment savvy as well as early and judicious planning has greatly improved his financial standing. Nevertheless, there is always room to reassess your financial situation in relation to key life goals and objectives.

OCBC Life Goals offer a holistic and structured goal planning approach that balances your changing needs and ambitions to ensure you are on track to reaching your goals. Let's look at some key considerations for Mr Quan's future financial planning.

UNDERSTANDING HIS GOALS

While Mr Quan may not have set his sights on retirement in the near future, it is still worthwhile to plan for this life stage.

The first step would be to understand the type of retirement he would like and calculate all the associated costs to make this a reality. Having a comprehensive retirement plan in place could go a long way towards providing peace of mind as he pursues his passions.

As Mr Quan continues to amass more wealth with the steady expansion of his business, legacy planning will likely become an important focus for financial planning. This could be an important exercise to account for his growing base of assets and address key issues of distribution.

On a more practical basis, he should consider having a will to have his wishes executed accordingly. Without a will, he will be leaving it to the Intestate Succession Act for distribution of all his assets. This means his wife is to inherit 50 per cent of his assets, and both his children are to equally inherit the remaining 50 per cent.

The somewhat financially introspective nature of life goal planning could also help uncover other financial needs and objectives that he may have missed or not addressed adequately",Plan differently with OCBC Life Goals,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/plan-differently-with-ocbc-life-goals,"MS TAN SIEW LEE, HEAD OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT SINGAPORE, OCBC BANKRetirement is not an option for Mr Quan, not while he remains passionate about growing his business.

Hong Kong police on Friday denied applications for four anti-government marches that were slated to take place this weekend in neighbourhoods such as Tai Po, Wong Tai Sin and Sham Shui Po.
Police had cited public safety reasons for rejecting the applications, but protest organisers said the reasons were inadequate and infringed on Hong Kong citizens' basic rights.","secretary, economy, reasons, press, protests, hurt, hong, financial, weekend, meeting, sars, leader, tai, kong, crisis, lam",Man-Made Disaster

In its semi-annual Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said risks to stability have generally diminished in the last six months amid stronger global economic growth and higher interest rates that have improved bank earnings.
However, it added that already highly leveraged US companies may not be in a position to translate a cash flow boost from tax reform proposals by the Trump administration into productive capital investments that can aid sustainable growth.
Mr Trump has proposed cutting the corporate income tax rate to 15 per cent and taxing offshore earnings at a reduced level when companies repatriate the money.
He has also vowed to roll back the Dodd-Frank Act, a set of laws enacted after the financial crisis to discourage excessive risk taking, although the President has yet to outline his plan in full.","global, imf, companies, financial, trump, cuts, instability, proposed, stability, president, lead, tax, crisis",Man-Made Disaster

Moreover, unprecedented foreign presence in local financial markets increased their susceptibility to global financial boom-bust cycles.

Such as how can we decouple growth in the economy from growth in C02 emissions. Or how to ensure that the fourth industrial revolution is something that benefits all mankind.

I hope our discussions will ensure that the growth that we are now seeing, which is substantial, is also more inclusive, that it avoids new asset bubbles... I also hope that it gives developing countries a chance to be part of global development.

By then, he was so plugged into the study of consumer behaviour and the role of regulators that he decided he needed to expand his research into different terrains beyond banks. ""I wanted to shape public policies to protect consumers,"" he says simply.

And that is just what he has been doing. His research findings have appeared in top academic journals and been used in policy decisions by government agencies globally, including Consumer Financial Protection in the US and the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore.

For instance, he and his team discussed their research on the spending patterns of retirees with policymakers involved in the Silver Support Scheme, which supports the income of the bottom 20 per cent of retirees.

Since joining NUS five years ago, he has won the institution's Outstanding Researcher Award twice, in 2013 and this year.

In more ways than one, he is following in the footsteps of his late father, who worked on policy problems as an economist with the World Bank.

Lithe and trim, the elder of two children spent the first six years of his life in a small town in Uttar Pradesh in India.

His father started out as an accountant handling contracts in the Indian civil service; his mother was a housewife. Both came from big families.

Contractors and businessmen hoping to land tenders always tried to grease his father's palms but he was straight as an arrow.

""A contractor bought ice cream for my sister and me when we were walking around Shimla one day,"" says the chatty professor, referring to the famous Indian hill town. ""When my father saw that, he threw the ice cream away and said, 'This is the guy who applies for the tenders I prepare. He can't just give my children ice cream.'""

When Prof Sumit was six, his father uprooted the family to Africa.

""My sister was born with a cleft palate. My father wanted the best treatment for her but because he refused to take bribes, he decided he had to get a job which paid more. He took a World Bank job in Africa, working on privatisation and stabilisation policies,"" he says.

Their first stop was Tanzania, where he attended school in a small town in Iringa. ""I had to learn Swahili and ended up repeating a year.""

After a few years and a stint in Dar es Salaam, they moved to Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

""It was a tough country. Idi Amin had just been kicked out and there were coups in the country,"" he says, referring to the late Ugandan president, notorious for his brutal regime and crimes against humanity during his reign from 1971 to 1979.

""I went to school with a bodyguard who was armed with a machine gun. He'd drop me off and take me home. Because my father worked at the World Bank, I was a potential kidnap target,"" he says, adding that armed robbers entered the family home late one night and carted everything of value away.

He has vivid memories of another evening when his father decided to go for a drive with the bodyguard and took him along. He saw more than 200 bodies dumped in a ditch.

""It made me think about instability and the role of government, and a lot of my research now grew out of the things I saw,"" he says.

That included huge wealth disparity. His family had good housing provided by the World Bank but many of his Ugandan friends in school lived in mudhouses.

""You'd see people on the streets who didn't have a place to live in and the average person lived on a measly $1 per day,"" he recalls.

Ms Christine Lagarde, speaking at a conference in Dubai on global business and social trends, said economies were also supported by plenty of financing available.

""I'm reasonably optimistic because of the landscape we have at the moment. But we cannot sit back and wait for growth to continue as normal,"" she said in her first public comments on market movements since the latest round of turmoil at the end of last week.

Global stock markets were hit by wild fluctuations, with the US benchmark S&P 500 tumbling 5.2 per cent last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. The volatility was fuelled by investor worries about rising interest rates and potential inflation.

Ms Lagarde repeated an IMF forecast, originally issued last month, that the global economy would grow 3.9 per cent this year and at the same pace next year, which she said was a good backdrop for needed reforms. She did not give details of the reforms she wanted to see beyond saying the authorities needed to move to the regulation of activities, not entities.

2704,10/2016,"Concern had been mounting all week over the DoJ demand and conflicting reports in German media on whether Berlin would come to the troubled bank's aid if necessary, which have sapped the bank's market valuation since Monday.

But by the afternoon a statement from Deutsche chief executive John Cryan lifted the mood on markets and saw the price move modestly back upwards, before a rush for the shares in the final minutes of trading in Frankfurt.

""At no time in the last two decades has Deutsche Bank been as safe as it is today,"" Cryan wrote in a memo to his staff, pointing to the bank's €215 billion (S$329 billion) in liquidity reserves, ongoing restructuring and a €1 billion operating profit in the first half.

The new total of US$5.4 billion is just shy of the total Deutsche has set aside in provisions for its thousands of outstanding legal actions, and ""may make a rights issue more palatable and makes a government bailout much less likely,"" CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler wrote in a note.

Investors had been spooked by signs that Deutsche's ""sophisticated clients are feeling the same twitchiness as investors,"" he went on, causing ""a mass crisis of confidence.""

Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that about 10 hedge funds that clear trades with Deutsche Bank withdrew some excess cash and derivatives holdings and moved the assets to other firms this week, citing an internal bank document.

AFP sources knowledgeable of the situation confirmed that 10 hedge funds had pulled funds out, including Millennium Partners, Capula Investment, and British fund Rokos Capital Management.

Bloomberg said that the ""vast majority"" of the bank's clients have made no changes to their exposure at the bank, a position echoed by Deutsche itself when it insisted that some 800 remaining customers trusted in its ""stable financial position.""

Deutsche has repeatedly said that it will not have to pay the full amount demanded by the DoJ over its role in the devastating subprime mortgage crisis, pointing to US banks that negotiated much lower settlements.

But investors feared that the fine could still be large enough to wipe out the US$5.5 billion in provisions the bank has set aside for legal entanglements.

The subprimes case is just one of 8,000 burdening Deutsche Bank, with an investigation by New York regulators over allegations of money laundering at its Moscow office looming on the horizon.

Deutsche was among the worst performers in a European Banking Authority stress test of large banks whose results were released in July, although Cryan insisted the exercise had demonstrated the institution's resilience to future crises",Deutsche Bank close to slashing US fine: Source,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/deutsche-bank-close-to-slashing-us-fine-source,"""At no time in the last two decades has Deutsche Bank been as safe as it is today,"" Cryan wrote in a memo to his staff, pointing to the bank's €215 billion (S$329 billion) in liquidity reserves, ongoing restructuring and a €1 billion operating profit in the first half.

2712,04/2017,"In one of the last lawsuits from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the High Court dismissed a US$15 million (S$21 million) claim by an investment firm suing a bank for losses in a financial product known as ""share accumulators"".

The court was not convinced that Societe Generale Bank & Trust had to get clearance from Mr Lucas (who goes by one name) as part of a contract whenever his wife Lenny Patricia Halim Liem inked deals for First Asia Capital Investments(FAC) to invest in the share accumulator scheme.

Both were authorised signatories for FAC, which entered into share accumulators with the bank through its relationship manager.

The accumulator, or discounted share purchase programme, is a product that lets investors buy shares at a market discount. If the price rises by more than a certain percentage, the contract ends and the investor takes a profit. But if the market price falls below the discount price, the investor would be required to continue buying at the same price, which would now be at a premium above the market price.

Judge of Appeal Steven Chong, in judgment grounds last week, noted that share accumulators sparked financial woes for many investors following the 2008 global financial crisis and might explain why many sued banks to disclaim them.

FAC entered into 103 share accumulators with the bank involving shares in 27 firms, trading over some 18 months till January 2008.

But about three months later, all but 18 of the 103 accumulators had been knocked out; the 18 accumulators led to US$15.86 million in losses.

FAC sued the bank claiming it breached an oral agreement under which Mr Lucas' written consent was required. The pact was in addition to the main contract, under which Ms Lenny was a signatory but served as an ""ancillary person"".

Mr Gabriel Peter, acting for FAC, also brought several other claims against the bank, including misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and undue influence. Lawyers Suresh Nair and Kenneth Koh, defending the bank and relationship manager, pointed to, among other things, transcripts of conversations which showed Ms Lenny actively made decisions and was not an ""ancillary person"" who had no authority to enter or exit share transactions.

Justice Chong found ""the objective circumstances confirm that the (oral) collateral agreement did not and could not have existed.""

He added: ""It is difficult to believe that Lucas would not have wanted the security of a written collateral agreement given that he is a commercial lawyer who would have, by his own admission, understood the importance of evidence.""

Justice Chong dismissed the claims and ordered FAC to pay $750,000 in legal costs to the bank and its relationship manager, noting the time spent to review and transcribe 338 recordings of phone conversations between Ms Lenny and the relationship manager in the run",Court dismisses $21m claim over losses in 2008 crisis,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/court-dismisses-21m-claim-over-losses-in-2008-crisis,"In one of the last lawsuits from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the High Court dismissed a US$15 million (S$21 million) claim by an investment firm suing a bank for losses in a financial product known as ""share accumulators"".

But cautious households who already put away more than half their nest-egg in cold hard yen, are increasingly bringing the cash home.
But the Bank of Japan's move to usher in negative interest rates last year and changes to the tax code have propelled demand for alternatives to keeping money in the bank.
A negative interest rate means the average saver can literally be paying to put their money in a bank, depending on how much they shell out in fees for withdrawals and transfers while getting almost no interest on their savings.
By contrast, Americans hold just 13 per cent of their savings in cash and just over a third in equities, while Europeans fall somewhere in between.","japanese, tax, cash, savings, yen, interest, safe, bank, tokyo, kick, cent, stock, rates, negative, opt, play",Man-Made Disaster

2738,12/2016,"MADRID • Spanish banks must repay customers more than €4 billion (S$6.04 billion) after Europe's top court overturned on Wednesday a Spanish ruling that capped liabilities relating to a disputed mortgage clause, posing a new challenge to some lenders.

Banks will have to compensate customers for what they lost even before May 2013, when Spain's Supreme Court declared the mortgages invalid if the terms had not been presented clearly.

The home loans had an interest rate that could not fall below a certain level, meaning customers missed out when rates dropped below this level.

New charges resulting from the ruling by the European Court of Justice could eat into bank earnings, which have already been eroded by record low interest rates and fierce competition for a shrunken loan pool, and encourage more mergers.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters the country's financial system was healthy and could deal with the consequences.

Banco Popular, the sector's weak link and seen as a potential takeover target, faces about €330 million in new charges. Its shares led losses among Spanish banks, falling 6 per cent to €0.954.

The ruling also knocked shares in Banco Sabadell, Caixabank, BBVA and Liberbank ",EU orders Spanish banks to repay $6b to mortgagors,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/eu-orders-spanish-banks-to-repay-6b-to-mortgagors,"MADRID • Spanish banks must repay customers more than €4 billion (S$6.04 billion) after Europe's top court overturned on Wednesday a Spanish ruling that capped liabilities relating to a disputed mortgage clause, posing a new challenge to some lenders.

Most Spanish banks have removed the clauses since the 2013 ruling and already set aside money to cover compensation of around €5 billion that the court ruled had been incorrectly charged.
The ruling, which was unexpected by the banks, is final and cannot be appealed against, an EU court spokesman said.

""In August, we will also discuss further the range of instruments at our disposal,"" Carney said.

Investors are facing a deeply uncertain political outlook after Prime Minister David Cameron said he would resign after losing the vote which will see the country separate from the EU, which buys almost half of Britain's exports.

The lack of political leadership has heaped responsibility on the BoE to steer the economy.

Carney angered supporters of the Leave campaign before the referendum with his warnings about the consequences of a Brexit.

In response to a question from a reporter on Thursday, who asked if his position would become untenable if Leave campaigners take control of Britain's government, Carney said: ""The exact opposite.""

""It would be irresponsible of me, or any of my other colleagues, to walk away from those obligations, because those are our obligations under statute,"" he said.

In his speech, delivered in the Bank's ornate Court Room, Carney said there were limits to how low the Bank could cut rates: ""As we have seen elsewhere, if interest rates are too low or negative, the hit to bank profitability could perversely reduce credit availability or even increase its overall price.""

Carney said a first wave of contingency measures drawn up by the Bank and Britain's finance ministry were ""working well.""

2812,07/2016,"FRANKFURT/LONDON • The run on British property funds has drawn attention to the vulnerability of the commercial real estate sector, largely funded by domestic banks and building societies but increasingly by foreign banks and insurers.

Banks and building societies in the UK had around £90 billion (S$157 billion) in credit extended to domestic commercial real estate at the end of last year, said a study by De Montfort University.

German, other international and US banks had £55 billion of exposure, having increased their investments in the sector since the 2008 financial crisis. Insurers, which prior to the crisis had barely any exposure, accounted for £25.9 billion.

This means they could all take a hit if Britain's vote to leave the European Union leads to a slowdown in business investment and depresses demand for offices and shopping centres, as expected.

""There is a lot of uncertainty at the moment,"" said Ms Sonja Knorr, a funds analyst in Germany at rating agency Scope. ""Transactions in the UK have come to a halt.""

The total value of British outstanding commercial real estate debt stood at £183.3 billion as at Dec 31 last year, the De Montfort study said.

In the past week or so, more than £18 billion of investor cash in commercial property has been frozen as funds run by M&G Investments, Standard Life Investments and Threadneedle Investments, among others, suspended trading.

One measure it could consider would be to tighten the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limit further. This would have multiple benefits.

First, the current interest rate environment can lead to a significant mispricing of assets, and tightening the TDSR would reduce the risk of Singaporeans overleveraging to purchase properties.

This, in turn, would lower the systemic risk that may be posed to the financial system by overleveraged individuals, given continued uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and the direction of interest rates.

Second, reducing the amount of capital locked up in property allows it to be deployed to more productive uses. This capital could be used instead to invest in businesses to help them grow.

""Even as of the fourth quarter of 2019, millennials were still below, in terms of wealth, where we would expect them to be based on older generations at similar ages.""

The financial crisis shaped the views of millennials in ways that are already driving politics on both sides of the Atlantic, including the greater willingness of younger people to refer to themselves as socialists.

Millennials elevated Mr Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour party in Britain and Mr Bernie Sanders to the verge of the United States Democratic presidential nomination.

The coronavirus crisis is likely to sharpen many of these views.

For many millennials, the social contract did not work for them, even before this latest crisis.

Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser says millennials in the US look at the free healthcare for seniors under Medicare and tax breaks on mortgages and see a form of ""boomer socialism"" that excludes them. ""America has not done a good job of protecting or empowering its younger citizens,"" he says.

He compared the country's reserves to the Singapore Armed Forces' arsenal, and said: ""No country's armed forces will ever tell you exactly how much ammunition and weaponry they really have.

""To do so is to betray valuable intelligence to potential adversaries. This is obviously not a wise defence strategy, and likewise should not be adopted for our financial reserves.""

Mr Heng cited how then President S R Nathan gave the nod for $150 billion from past reserves to be used to guarantee bank deposits during the 2008 financial crisis, which helped calm depositors and prevent a run on banks. ""As a small country without any natural resources and highly dependent on imports, our reserves are vital to our overall economic and financial stability, and our well",Why size of reserves cannot be revealed,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/why-size-of-reserves-cannot-be-revealed,"This is obviously not a wise defence strategy, and likewise should not be adopted for our financial reserves.""
""It is neither in the interest of Singapore or Singaporeans to repeatedly ask about the size of our reserves.

Thought leaders suggest that achieving this balance involves calibrating the competing goals of supporting the growth of fintech with the regulatory goals of financial stability and consumer protection, and the key will be to adopt innovative and smarter digital regulatory systems.
This means going beyond mere adoption of technology to digitalise regulatory, compliance and reporting processes, to developing strong information technology capabilities - including in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.
This would allow for the analysis of relevant leading indicators such as those of financial instability and regulatory non-compliance, to provide regulators with greater predictive ex ante capabilities to pre-emptively fight fraud.","tech, forum, spore, keeping, important, singapore, growth, financial, investments, reporting, pace, goals, regulatory, fintech, technology, covid19",Man-Made Disaster

The central bank's scenario did, however, foresee the economy bouncing back sharply in 2021 with growth of 15 per cent as lockdown restrictions are loosened.
The BoE kept its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low of 0.1 per cent and left its target for bond-buying, most of it British government debt, at£645 billion pounds (S$1.13 trillion), as the stimulus measures taken in March continued to play out.
But in a sign more might be on the way, two of its nine policymakers voted to increase the central bank's bond-buying firepower by £100 billion, and governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE could act again.
He said the BoE expected ""the recovery of the economy to happen over time, though much more rapidly than the pull-back from the global financial crisis.""","economy, slump, lockdown, worst, boe, coronavirus, financial, cent, uk, headed, 300, monetary, governor, economic, kept, scenario, crisis",Man-Made Disaster

China's government has been trying to rid the property sector of excess debt, based on the notion that homes are for living in rather than speculation.
Officials told some major banks last month to accelerate approval of mortgages in the fourth quarter, Bloomberg reported last week.","buyers, evergrande, plunge, developers, debt, sector, group, month, sales, deters, cent, property, china, crisis, bloomberg",Man-Made Disaster

""Of all the crisis spots around the world, I had come to believe that Central America held the best opportunity,"" Mr Biden wrote.
Drawing on his experience in Central America, Mr Biden and his team of foreign policy advisers have created plans for the region that are both a repudiation of President Donald Trump's hardball approach and an attempt to resurrect Obama-era initiatives.
Mr Trump's focus in the region has been on throttling back the flow of immigrants and drugs through harsh enforcement means and threats of imposing economic pain on neighbours.
Mr Biden and his team of experts, which includes immigrants from Latin America, say they would take a broader approach to the immigration issue - and to the region.","end, policy, violence, biden, white, region, central, dictating, plans, latin, bully, mr, trumps, children, america, vicepresident, bidens",Man-Made Disaster

The Fed's latest economic forecasts suggest a 6.5 per cent contraction in gross domestic product in 2020 that would take two years to reverse.
The projection for the unemployment rate was also downbeat, with a 9.3 per cent unemployment rate at the end of the year, or more than twice the level before the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.
While consistent with many economists' expectations of a check-mark-shaped recovery, the Fed's economic projections are in sharp contrast to recent comments from the White House after Friday's upside jobs surprise as well as some market participants' embrace of the notion of a V-shaped recovery.

The desperately needed shipments have caused a diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iran and Venezuela, which are under US sanctions.
The United States recently beefed up its naval presence in the Caribbean for what it said was an expanded antidrug operation.
Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned of retaliatory measures against the United States if Washington caused problems for tankers carrying Iranian fuel to Venezuela, the semi-official news agency Mehr reported.
In 2010-2011, state-run oil company PDVSA sent fuel to Iran, which was under sanctions aimed at stifling its nuclear weapons programme.","fuel, states, venezuela, waters, arriving, warning, starts, zone, despite, united, venezuelas, iran, venezuelan, iranian, economic, tankers",Man-Made Disaster

Still, despite the lack of a market reaction, some experts are worried whether the ""great central bank unwind"" may inadvertently sow the seeds for the next financial crisis.
This worry is reflected by Mr Claudio Borio, the chief economist at Bank of International Settlements, the bank for central banks.
The risk is that companies may face a debt trap because they had borrowed so much money when credit was cheap and may struggle to repay as interest rates go up with the Fed's tightening, he added.

The government announced a whopping RM250 billion ($82 billion) for all, not just a few and the sum describes the most generous stimulus ever made by a Malaysian prime minister.
A recent study by Khazanah Research Institute shows that the impact of Covid-19 on the urban poor comprises three major threats - money, food and living conditions.
To this, I would like to add livelihood, and the fact that these four threats would also be faced by the rural poor.

3303,04/2020,"""The psychology won't just bounce back,"" said Mr Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard, an investment research firm in London. ""People have had a real shock. The recovery will be slow, and certain behaviour patterns are going to change, if not forever at least for a long while.""

Rising stock prices in the US have in recent years propelled spending. Millions of people are now filing claims for unemployment benefits, while wealthier households are absorbing the reality of substantially diminished retirement savings.

Americans boosted their rates of savings in the years after the Great Depression. Fear and tarnished credit limited reliance on borrowing. That could happen again.

""The loss of income on the labour front is tremendous,"" Mr Dumas said. ""The loss of value in the wealth effect is also very strong.""

The sense of alarm is enhanced by the fact that every inhabited part of the globe is now in trouble.
