The images showed significant annual variation in ice melt and, combined with temperature data, showed that heatwaves were increasingly a major cause of ice loss - above and beyond global temperature rises.
In 2012, for example, when changes in atmospheric patterns caused unusually warm air to hover over the ice sheet for weeks, 527 billion tonnes of ice was lost.

Floods are natural phenomena, but climate change is altering Earth's rainfall patterns, making some regions wetter and others drier.

At least six Rohingya, including three children, died in landslides and flooding, while 15 Bangladeshis were killed and more than 200,000 stranded by flooding in Cox's Bazar, said Mr Mamunur Rashid, the district administrator.
Nearly one million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017.
It said more than 13,000 were forced to relocate in the camps, while thousands of facilities were damaged, including health clinics and toilets.
Refugees, many of them still recovering from massive fires that tore through the camps in March, said landslides and floods left homes ""totally covered with mud"".","thousands, floods, landslides, flooding, camps, bazar, water, rohingya, refugees, bangladesh, nightmare, hit, refugee, displaced, coxs"

Vice-minister at the water resources and emergency management ministries Zhou Xuewen told reporters that improving short-term weather forecasts and warning systems is key.
Henan suffered its worst floods on record last week after torrential downpours dumped nearly a year's worth of rain in the province in just three days.
The floods in Henan killed 73 people, with 14 deaths caused by the flooded subway.

Flooding and landslides are common during India's treacherous monsoon season from June to September and causes widespread devastation.
Five of the 16 people killed were swept away in the flood and the rest died when their mud houses collapsed, officials said.
This year's monsoon, which had earlier inundated the western coast, has claimed the lives of at least 250 people so far.
Last month, at least 200 people died in the western state of Maharashtra after landslides sent torrents of mud onto villages.","western, rescued, killed, dozens, state, west, swept, rescue, water, indias, states, 16, monsoon, officials, deluge"

Of the €30 billion, €28 billion will be split between the federal government and the states, a government official said.
The remaining €2 billion would be provided by Berlin for infrastructure projects.

Dr Merkel is scheduled to travel to the village of Schuld in Rhineland-Palatinate state, one of the two hardest-hit regions in western Germany, where the swollen Ahr river swept away houses and left debris piled high in the streets.
At least 144 people have died since last Wednesday in Germany's worst flooding in living memory, while 27 people have lost their lives in neighbouring Belgium.
Rescue crews in both countries were sifting through rubble to find victims, often in dangerous conditions.

The passengers crowded forward as the water rose, submerging the cars at the rear first because they were deeper in the tunnel.
As the water reached their waists, then chests, finally their necks, the passengers called emergency services or relatives.
Although flooding is common in China, researchers have attributed the extreme weather sweeping the planet to the consequences of climate change.
Aerial photographs showed scores of cars in Zhengzhou all but submerged, the fate of their drivers and passengers unknown.","cars, zhengzhou, china, reached, inundates, save, rain, flooding, grim, water, passengers, city, scenes, subway, flood"
