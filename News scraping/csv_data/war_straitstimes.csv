Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to travel to Germany on Saturday to meet Western leaders, with talks between him and US Vice President Kamala Harris expected.
Biden said it ""may not"" be wise for Ukraine's leader to leave his country as war fears reached a fever pitch.

Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, attending the Munich Security Conference, warned the size of the assembled Russian force far exceeded that needed for military drills, and that Russia had the capacity to invade without warning.","president, war, drills, ukraine, leader, ukraines, putin, fears, military, washington, zelensky, russian, invade, meet, mount, moscow, oversee",Conflict/Terrorist activities

""It wouldn't surprise me if we increasingly see G-10 (Group of Ten) central banks recognising that actually a strong currency could be your friend during this tightening cycle.""

About 700 people had fled to the Thai town of Mae Sot after fighting between the Karen National Union (KNU) and Myanmar's army, the authorities in the western Thai border province of Tak said in a statement.

The study is hardly the first to reach this conclusion: The United States and European countries have sanctioned Russia for years for arms transfers to separatist forces that they say Moscow is supporting in Ukraine.
While unlikely to change the overall picture, the study offered a fine-grained view of illicit weapons transfers in Ukraine and illustrated the scope of the arms trade that is fuelling Europe's only active war.
Earlier analyses of Russian weapons transfers in Ukraine leaned on photographs or government intelligence.

The prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, showed an increasing trend over the years, even after adjusting for the possible effect of an ageing population.

113,11/2021,"One in three Singaporeans are projected to develop diabetes in their lifetimes with the figure rising to one million people by 2050, according to the Ministry of Health.

It seems alarming but this situation can be greatly mitigated. In fact, there are several different ways to manage diabetes, and the ""most correctable risk factor"", is maintaining a normal body mass index/weight, says endocrinologist Dr Nitish Mishra, from Singapore Medical Group Diabetes, Thyroid and Endocrine Clinic.

He adds: ""The plan always used to be to treat the diabetes first then deal with weight. But if you look at recent recommendations from major societies, Both Improving diabetes and managing weight need to be targeted together.

""Once you get the weight down, diabetes control is more likely to improve. In certain cases, there's a strong chance you can send diabetes into remission.""

Singapore's War on Diabetes campaign is in its fifth year as the government continues to tackle the chronic disease that currently affects about 400,000 people here.

What's even more worrying is that an increasing number of young people are presenting with Type 2 diabetes, says Dr Mishra. Traditionally, Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s, but he now sees patients as young as 13.

""The age incidence for diabetes is going down and this is usually due to a combination of two to three risk factors. A family history of the condition, obesity or a sedentary lifestyle all increase your risk for Type 2 diabetes,"" he says.

One of the most prevailing reasons for eating and living healthily is to reduce the chances of getting diabetes. On top of that, diabetes is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular or heart disease.

Two out of three people with diabetes die from cardiovascular disease, says Dr Mishra, adding that studies show that up to 35 per cent of patients with heart failure also have diabetes.

Having diabetes does not mean that you automatically get heart disease, but Dr Mishra explains that the longer you have poorly",Managing diabetes: Why weight loss is as important as your blood sugar levels,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/managing-diabetes-why-weight-loss-is-as-important-as-your-blood-sugar-levels,"But if you look at recent recommendations from major societies, Both Improving diabetes and managing weight need to be targeted together.
What's even more worrying is that an increasing number of young people are presenting with Type 2 diabetes, says Dr Mishra.
Managing diabetes with weight lossA recent study recommends that loss of 15 per cent or more of bodyweight can have a disease-modifying effect in people with type 2 diabetes.
This is an achievable target and may lead to the reversal of diabetes in the first few years after diagnosis, says Dr Mishra.
Dr Mishra explains: ""It helps your insulin work better and lowers the levels of the glucagon hormone, which leads to increased glucose levels in diabetics.""","heart, weight, levels, loss, diabetes, dr, ras, important, type, blood, risk, patients, mishra, managing, sugar",Conflict/Terrorist activities

The President's withdrawal from Afghanistan makes clear that he saw risking more US lives there as no longer in America's national interest.
The Biden doctrine sees China as America's existential competitor, Russia as a disrupter, Iran and North Korea as nuclear proliferators, cyber threats as ever-evolving and terrorism as spreading far beyond Afghanistan.

Former US president Donald Trump approved steep tariffs on solar panel imports in January 2018 to protect US producers, triggering an outcry from China and South Korea, and even protests from the American solar industry.
Beijing requested the WTO set up a dispute panel to judge whether the tariffs violated international trade rules, and in its decision, the body said it ""rejected all of China's claims"".
""I welcome the WTO panel's findings rejecting China's challenges to the US solar safeguard as baseless,"" she said in a statement.

The specific licence, issued by the Treasury Department last Wednesday (Aug 25), authorises the US government and its contractors to support humanitarian assistance to people in Afghanistan, including the delivery of food and medicine, despite US sanctions on the Taliban.
The licence, which expires on March 1, 2022, comes amid concerns that Washington's sanctions on the Taliban could speed an unfolding humanitarian crisis in the country, which relies heavily on foreign aid.
""This is targeted humanitarian assistance designed to help the people of Afghanistan,"" the official said, adding the assistance is not going to Taliban authorities.
The group has also encouraged aid organisations to continue their work, saying aid was welcome as long as it was not used as a means of political influence over Afghanistan.","humanitarian, assistance, country, afghanistan, official, flow, aid, taliban, licence, issued, sanctions, department, treasury, ease, united",Conflict/Terrorist activities

The Federal Government plans to spend A$498 million (S$520 million) on an extension of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra that will expand its exhibition space and allow it to display larger objects such as a fighter helicopter and a reconnaissance plane.
However, some MPs in the committee are expected to write a dissenting report, as the project has proven controversial and raised questions about the proper aims of a national war memorial.
Critics of the war memorial's overhaul have expressed concern about the enormous cost, arguing that the memorial already successfully and respectfully chronicles Australia's war history for the general public.

The ceasefire brokered by Russia saw Mr Pashinyan hand over large parts of Azerbaijan that had been controlled for several decades by Armenian separatists.

Although private military companies are illegal in Russia, Wagner has in recent years played an increasingly important role in buttressing and realising the Kremlin's ambitions abroad, observers say.
The group was reportedly dispatched alongside Russian war planes and ground troops following Moscow's intervention in the Syrian war in September 2015 on the side of President Bashar al-Assad's army.
The complaint brought on Monday on behalf of the victim's family aims to force Moscow to bring criminal proceedings against the alleged members of the private contractor group, in what NGOs say is the first case of its kind.","war, case, wagner, ngos, syrian, syria, private, russia, contractor, torture, group, file, military, russian, mercenary, moscow, landmark",Conflict/Terrorist activities

Preserving the delicate peace in Northern Ireland without allowing the United Kingdom a back door into the European Union's single market through the 310-mile (500km) Irish land border was one of the trickiest issues of the Brexit divorce.
The solution formed the Northern Ireland protocol, which saw the province essentially remaining in the EU's customs union and having to adhere to many of the rules of its single market while the rest of Britain has left both.","sausage, european, solutions, trade, urges, sefcovic, london, brexit, britain, legal, uk, eu, northern, ireland, wars",Conflict/Terrorist activities

The gas-rich region of Marib has been a refuge for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence during Yemen's six-year-old war, expanding its main city rapidly.
The recent push towards Marib by Houthi forces, who control Yemen's most populous areas, comes alongside intensified drone attacks into Saudi Arabia by the Iran-aligned group.

684,03/2021,"MOSCOW • The Kremlin said that Moscow always hoped for the best but prepared for the worst when it was asked about the possibility of a new Cold War between the United States and Russia.

Diplomatic ties sank to a new low this week after US President Joe Biden said he thought President Vladimir Putin was ""a killer"", in an interview that prompted Russia to recall its ambassador to the US.

Mr Putin later offered Mr Biden live online talks in the coming days.

Yesterday, the Kremlin's spokesman, Mr Dmitry Peskov, said Mr Putin's offer of talks remained open and that Mr Putin could do any time that was convenient for Mr Biden, though the offer would not stay on the table indefinitely.

""Putin said that despite everything, there's no point in playing at megaphone diplomacy and trading barbs. There is a point in continuing relations,"" Mr Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

He was asked about a new Cold War between the two countries.

""We, of course, always hope for the best, but are always ready for the worst. As far as Russia is concerned, President Putin has clearly stated his desire to continue ties,"" he said.

""But, of course, we can't not take into account Biden's comments,"" he said, in a reference to Biden's interview with ABC News broadcast on Wednesday.

In it, Mr Biden said ""I do"" when asked if he believed Mr Putin was a killer, prompting Mr Putin to cite a Russian children's playground chant in response saying ""he who said it, did it"".

Mr Biden in the interview also described Mr Putin as having no soul, and said the Russian leader would pay a price for alleged meddling in the November 2020 US presidential election, something the Kremlin denies.

The Biden administration is weighing additional sanctions to block construction of the nearly completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, potentially including the project's parent company Nord Stream 2, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The sanctions could come in the form of an interim report that may also single out an insurance company that has been working with the vessels laying the pipeline in the Baltic Sea, as well as other companies providing support vessels and materials to the project, according to the sources.

They asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deliberations.

692,03/2021,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON • Ms Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, criticised ongoing military drills in South Korea and warned the new US administration that the smell of cordite wafting over the border would not help bring peace, state news reported.

Ms Kim's statement yesterday was the North's first public message to Washington since President Joe Biden took office in January.

United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin are due to arrive in Seoul today for their first talks with South Korean counterparts.

Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are travelling in Asia this week for foreign policy and security talks with allies in South Korea and Japan, among other stops.

""We take this opportunity to warn the new US administration trying hard to give off powder smell in our land,"" Ms Kim said. ""If it wants to sleep in peace for the coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.""

For all the imagery of Ms Kim's words, the joint springtime military drill that started last week was limited to computer simulations because of the coronavirus risk as well as the ongoing efforts to engage with the North.

But her message was clear.

""War drills and hostility can never go with dialogue and cooperation,"" Ms Kim said.

When asked about Ms Kim's statement, Mr Blinken told a briefing in Tokyo that he was aware of her comments, but that he was more interested in hearing what America's allies and partners think about North Korea.

Dr Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London, said the timing of Ms Kim's comments seems designed to ensure that North Korea will be at the top of Mr Blinken and Mr Austin's agenda when they land in Seoul.

""Until now, the discussion was focusing on the Quad, dealing with China and the North Korea policy review,"" he said. ""Now Kim's statement will be central to discussions."" The Quad is an informal security grouping involving Australia, India, Japan and the US.

North Korea has so far rebuffed entreaties from the US to engage in dialogue, the White House said on Monday, as a chill in relations that began under then President Donald Trump has extended into Mr Biden's presidency.

White House spokesman Jen Psaki told reporters that US officials have reached out to North Korea through a number of channels since Mr Biden took office nearly two months ago.

""Our goal is to reduce the risk of escalation. But to date we have not received any response,"" Ms Psaki said. She did not elaborate on what type of escalation the US was concerned about.

Ms Kim also mocked South Korea for ""resorting to shrunken war games, now that they find themselves in the quagmire of political, economic and epidemic crisis"".

China announced the ban last week, citing ""harmful creatures"" it said could come with the fruit, threatening China's own agriculture.
Politicians have rallied behind pineapple farmers, posting pictures of themselves in fields with farmers and tucking into the fruit on their social media pages, encouraging domestic consumers to pick up the slack.
President Tsai Ing-wen on Sunday visited a pineapple farm in southern Taiwan, where the bulk of the fruit is grown and where the DPP traditionally enjoys strong support.
China has ramped up pressure to get Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty, including regularly flying fighter jets and bombers near Taiwan or into its air defence identification zone.","responsibility, war, pineapple, necessary, island, fruit, dpp, words, politics, china, pineapples, escalates, mainland, ban, farmers, taiwan",Conflict/Terrorist activities

In doing so, Sheik Heikel Khalid Bafana, 48, who was detained in March last year, has acted in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security and interests, the agency said in a statement.

ISD did not provide details on which faction he backed or the foreign country he had worked for, citing operational reasons.

ISD also said it did not disclose Heikel's case earlier as investigations into his activities in Yemen were complex, and doing so would have jeopardised ongoing investigations.

ISD said it was publicising Heikel's case now ""to underline Singapore's stern stand against anyone who supports, promotes, undertakes, or makes preparations to undertake armed violence"".

Heikel, a trained lawyer, migrated to Yemen with his family around 2008 and ran a consultancy which advised foreign companies on security risks and business opportunities.

ISD said he assisted one of the warring factions and volunteered to fight alongside it. He also acted as a broker between this faction and the foreign power, and sought to secure military equipment, supplies and funds to conduct military training.

Heikel also collected intelligence on Yemen for this foreign power from around 2012 to 2018, for which he was paid ""substantial amounts"", said ISD, adding that his dealings with the foreign power were clandestine.

An ISD spokesman said in response to The Straits Times' queries that Heikel first had the intention to engage in armed violence in 2017. He attracted ISD's attention as he had made social media posts suggesting he was involved in the conflict.

Speaking ahead of the 45th anniversary of the fall of Saigon last Thursday, Mai says her new novel The Mountains Sing, written in English, aims to shine a light on the stories of women who not only endured and survived conflict, but also had to rebuild shattered lives time and again.

""I've read a lot of Vietnam war fiction in English and most of it is written in the voices of men,"" adds the poet and writer.

""I grew up with incredible women around me,"" she says, adding that while many sons and fathers lost their lives in combat, it was women who had to deal with the heartache and the consequences.

""My childhood was full of images of women who were waiting for the return of their loved ones from the war. My village was basically empty of men and the women later had to carry on, had to raise the kids and survive.""

The Mountains Sing is written from the perspective of a Vietnamese grandmother and her granddaughter. It tells the story of four generations of their family through much of the 20th century, spanning the French colonial period and the rise of communism to the war with the United States and the present day.

Novels such as The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien and Graham Greene's The Quiet American have become classics, but offer few details of the female experience.
