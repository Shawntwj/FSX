A global index released on Thursday (Feb 3) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation showed that food prices in January climbed to their highest level since 2011, when skyrocketing costs contributed to political uprisings in Egypt and Libya.
Even before the pandemic, global food prices had been trending upwards as disease wiped out much of China's pig herd and the United States-China trade war resulted in Chinese tariffs on US agricultural goods.
But as the pandemic began in early 2020, the world experienced seismic shifts in demand for food.
While food prices appear set to stabilise, events like a conflict in Ukraine, a major producer of wheat and corn, or further adverse weather could change that calculation, Mr Bogmans said.","price, weather, world, prices, 2decade, hit, threatening, increases, poorest, pandemic, supply, worlds, food, cent, high, global"

The stand-off between Russia and the West over Ukraine can add more volatility in energy and food prices, which are already in flux, and further boost inflation in Singapore and elsewhere by adding to the supply constraints caused by the pandemic.","spore, singapore, situation, volatility, turn, standoff, ukraine, russia, supply, worse, choke, food, asia, west, energy, tensions"
2,Agri-food sector growing rapidly in S'pore with drive towards sustainable food innovation,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/agri-food-sector-growing-rapidly-in-spore-with-drive-towards-sustainable-food-innovation,"SINGAPORE - As the world grapples with challenges to food supplies such as climate change, Singapore has been shoring up its food security through agri-food innovation.
The high-tech agriculture sector in Singapore is expected to create about 4,700 jobs by 2030.
Among firms driving Singapore's agri-food sector growth is plant-based food manufacturer Next Gen Foods, which launched its chicken alternative TiNDLE in Singapore last March.
While Next Gen Foods' product R&D is done in Singapore, its production facility is in the Netherlands.
Food technologist Claudia Lee works on new product development at Next Gen Foods, researching and developing new plant-based products to address global consumer demand.","spore, rapidly, singapore, foods, growing, sustainable, agrifood, plantbased, sector, food, innovation, tindle, development, product, gen, drive"
3,Researchers develop blueprint for sustainable food system using black soldier flies,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/researchers-develop-blueprint-for-sustainable-food-system-using-black-soldier-flies,"SINGAPORE - Imagine a future where food waste is converted into nutrients for food production, all in a work of magic by the ubiquitous black soldier fly.
This is exactly the vision that an interdisciplinary team of researchers hopes to realise, as they develop a blueprint to integrate food waste management and sustainable food production in urban settings like Singapore.
As larvae, black soldier flies are able to consume up to four times their body weight in food waste daily, converting the waste into a by-product known as frass - which can be used to substitute or supplement commercial fertilisers in agriculture.
The project, which Prof Nalini led with Professor Stephen Cairns from the Singapore-ETH Centre's Future Cities Lab Global programme, is done in collaboration with researchers from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and ETH Zurich.
Prof Cairns said: ""Designing fully circular food systems for high-density cities like Singapore requires experimentation at different scales.","singapore, system, researchers, production, blueprint, soldier, project, sustainable, flies, using, national, nalini, prof, food, develop, waste, black"

Mr Xi told senior Communist Party leaders in a speech published late on Monday (Jan 24) that China needs to ""overcome the notion of rapid success"" and proceed gradually.
""Reducing emissions is not about reducing productivity, and it is not about not emitting at all,"" Mr Xi was quoted by state news agency Xinhua as saying.
""We must stick to the overall planning and ensure energy security, industrial supply chain security and food security at the same time as cutting carbon emissions,"" he said.
With energy supplies still a major concern after a wave of shortages hit manufacturers last year, Mr Xi also told party leaders that ""the gradual withdrawal of traditional energy must be based on the safe and reliable replacement by new energy"".","emissions, security, push, guarantee, state, xi, lowcarbon, told, china, food, countrys, targets, party, energy, mr, president"
5,Omicron's spread means more food outages at US grocery stores,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/omicrons-spread-means-more-food-outages-at-us-grocery-stores,"WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - The highly contagious Omicron virus variant is disrupting already stressed food supply chains, sickening so many workers that more shortages at grocery stores are all but certain.
All of that will help fuel wage increases and price surges for consumers, as well as 2020-style food outages.
""Labour shortages due to Omicron are going to exacerbate the issue.""
On the receiving side, the company is having trouble getting supplies from food manufacturers, especially processed items such as cereal and soup, Mr Sarsam said.
More food inspectors are calling in sick, too, said Ms Paula Soldner, chair of the National Joint Council of Food Inspections Locals.","seeing, means, workforce, omicron, outages, supply, variant, stores, food, cent, spread, manufacturers, omicrons, shortages, labour, grocery"

There are also areas that cannot be touched - both sacred sites and sections of land near small isolated indigenous groups that avoid contact with others.
Rules governing fishing also exist - including that setting off dynamite, a method used elsewhere in the Amazon to kill fish, is banned.
Almost half of the remaining intact forests in the Amazon Basin are in indigenous territories, according to the United Nations.
A 2021 UN report found that in nearly every Latin American country, indigenous lands showed lower deforestation rates than other forest areas.","protects, rainforest, trees, souza, indigenous, small, using, forest, colombias, ms, soil, used, amazon, defending, culture"

Other countries on the list included South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Madagascar and Yemen.
The country asked to be removed from the list of ""hotspots"" and for statements made about Colombia to be ""corrected"", Foreign Minister Martha Lucia Ramirez told reporters.
It also highlighted a lack of food security for 1.1 million Venezuelan migrants who fled their country and now live in Colombia.

9,Trickle of humanitarian aid enters North Korea as border closure drags on,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/trickle-of-humanitarian-aid-enters-north-korea-as-border-closure-drags-on,"SEOUL (REUTERS) - After nearly two years of border closures to protect North Korea against the pandemic, some humanitarian aid is trickling into the country, though shipments of key supplies including food remain blocked, according to United Nations organisations.
North Korea has not reported any Covid-19 cases and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs since the pandemic began early 2020.
North Korea called that report ""slander,"" but leader Kim Jong Un has admitted to a ""tense"" food situation.
Since August 2021, ""very few relief items"" were permitted to enter North Korea, after undergoing a quarantine period of more than three months followed by disinfection procedures, the World Food Programme said in its December report on North Korea.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said in October that Covid-19 aid supplies had arrived in North Korea but were being held in quarantine at Nampo.","korea, humanitarian, world, enters, trickle, supplies, country, closure, aid, covid19, drags, food, united, border, shipments, report, north"

""We are facing a fry-tening supply crunch,"" McDonald's Malaysia said in a social media post this week.
McDonald's confirmed in a statement to AFP that its Malaysian branches are ""currently experiencing supply challenges"", with large servings of fries unavailable since Monday (Jan 24).
The chain, which has hundreds of outlets in Malaysia, said it would ""closely monitor"" supplies, and that large portions would be offered as soon as possible.

Although her village was devastated by armed conflict in Yemen, Ms Fatima returned to resume her livelihood, buying a boat with money she earned from selling fish.
The conflict - between Houthi Shi'a Muslim rebels and a Sunni Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia - dates from 2014, and has led to what Unicef has termed the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.
Some 20.1 million people (almost two-thirds of the population) required food assistance at the beginning of 2020, with approximately 80 per cent of the population relying on humanitarian aid.

Now their work has taken on extra significance as alarm grows over global warming and nature loss, with mangroves regarded as a key weapon in the fight against climate change.
As fish catches dwindled for him and other fishermen in the late 1990s, Mr Ilias mobilised his peers to join him in restoring the fast-vanishing mangrove forests through the Penang Inshore Fishermen Welfare Association (PIFWA), which he leads.
Their small initiative has won recognition - to date about 30 local companies have sponsored their tree-planting as part of corporate social responsibility projects.
PIFWA charges the companies a small fee of RM8 (S$2.60) per tree planted, while participating fishermen are compensated with allowances for their time and labour.","stumble, nature, mangrove, forests, fishermen, penang, small, malaysias, ilias, finance, mangroveplanting, mangroves, mr, hurdle, tree"

The IMF's Global Debt Database reveals that 2020 saw the largest one-year surge in world debt since World War II.
Governments borrowed the bigger part (a little over half) of the increase, as global public debt jumped 20 per cent within the year, while private debt grew by 10 per cent.
The world financial crisis in 2008-2009 and the current pandemic crisis have primarily driven this surge.

The IMF last week cut its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy, and said uncertainty about the coronavirus pandemic, inflation, supply disruptions and US monetary tightening posed further risks.
The IMF chief said inflation had lasted longer and risen higher than expected, due to supply chain disruptions, stronger-than-expected consumer demand for goods and climate shocks on food prices.
Asked if those circumstances, and the escalating crisis between Russia and the West over Ukraine, could usher in an era of sustained inflation, Dr Georgieva said, ""The short answer is, it is too early to say.

The deepening understanding that the supply chain crisis has staying power poses a daunting challenge to policymakers.
Whirlpool recently warned that customers who purchased its washing machines, refrigerators and other household appliances would continue to experience delays as the company contended with supply chain problems.
The International Monetary Fund last week cited supply chain woes among other factors as it downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year to 4.4 per cent from 4.9 per cent.

""My business partner in North Korea told me on Friday that the land border will reopen to cargo freight on Jan 17,"" a Chinese commodities trader in the border town of Dandong told Reuters.
North Korea has not officially reported any Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began in early 2020, and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.
Another Chinese trader said she can arrange for cargo to be loaded onto a train in Dandong which is scheduled to cross over to North Korea on Monday.
After nearly two years of border closures, some humanitarian aid is trickling into North Korea, though shipments of key supplies including food remain blocked, according to United Nations organisations.","trade, korea, closures, resume, resumption, border, dandong, rail, told, chinese, train, traders, koreachina, shipments, cargo, north, end"

""We don't have food service people... we don't have supply chain people to deliver our most critical supplies, we don't have people to repair our equipment,"" Mr Mechanic said.
In Chicago, members are still working and the action was part of their bargaining process, but other branches are striking.
The union plans to end the day with a candlelight vigil near the White House to honour the thousands of nurses who have died from Covid-19.
At the hospital where Mr Mechanic works on Chicago's South Side, he said Covid-19 patients are just as sick as they have been throughout the pandemic.","hospital, protest, dont, covid19, conditions, variant, mechanic, sick, chicago, mr, nurses, working"

Besides external cost pressures, Singapore's domestic wage growth is likely to continue to improve as labour demand strengthens on the back of improving economic activity, Ms Low said.
""MTI and MAS will carefully monitor price trends over the next few months of the year closely, before revising the forecasts if necessary,"" Ms Low said.
