Yet the virus continued to kill.
A variant that emerged in 1920 was lethal enough that it should have counted as a fourth wave.
In some cities, among them Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Kansas City, deaths exceeded even those in the second wave, responsible for most of the pandemic's deaths in the United States.","wave, summer, deaths, united, learn, variant, ended, second, pandemic, states, 1918, subsided, worldwide, virus"

Karachi, the country's largest city, recorded its highest ever positivity ratio of 46.58 per cent in the last 24 hours.
About 70 million people in Pakistan, or 32 per cent of the population, have had two vaccine doses.
The infection numbers are lower compared to other countries, such as neighbouring India - but Pakistan tests 50 to 60 thousand people a day with a population of 220 million compared to India where around 1.9 million tests are being done per day.","began, million, day, pakistan, tests, records, daily, positivity, highest, 24, schools, pandemic, rising, cases, covid19, cent"

It called this inequality ""economic violence"" and said inequality is contributing to the death of 21,000 people every day due to a lack of access to healthcare, gender-based violence, hunger and climate change.
The pandemic has plunged 160 million people into poverty, the charity added, with non-white ethnic minorities and women bearing the brunt of the impact as inequality soared.
The report follows a December 2021 study by the group which found that the share of global wealth of the world's richest people soared at a record pace during the pandemic.

Omicron prompted countries to close their doors to southern Africa and threatened to widen an already worrying gap in access to vaccines.
Now Dr Ihekweazu, a veteran epidemiologist who previously led the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, aims to counter global discord with data.

The forecast from the Madrid-based United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) comes as Europe is grappling with a surge in infections and as a new heavily mutated Covid-19 variant, named Omicron, spreads across the globe.
The global tourism sector already lost US$2 trillion in revenue last year because of the pandemic, according to the UNWTO, making it one of sectors hit hardest by the health crisis.
While international tourism has taken a hit from the outbreak of disease in the past, the coronavirus is unprecedented in its geographical spread.
""Despite the improvement in the third quarter, the pace of recovery remains uneven across world regions due to varying degrees of mobility restrictions, vaccination rates and traveller confidence,"" it added.","vaccination, 27, coronavirus, cost, global, nations, restrictions, pandemic, world, arrivals, tourism, 2021, unwto, trillion, sector"

Between 2012 and 2019, alcohol death rates in the United Kingdom had been stable, the ONS said.

131,Omicron variant raises new fears for pandemic-hit world economy,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/omicron-variant-raises-new-fears-for-pandemic-hit-world-economy,"WASHINGTON (AFP) - Just as it was recovering from the body blow of the Covid-19 pandemic, the global economy has taken yet another hit from the Omicron variant of the virus, which has led to a raft of new travel restrictions.
The severity of the economic impact will depend on how dangerous the variant proves to be, and how well existing vaccinations stand up to it.
That has meant that even with the most favourable scenarios in mind, economists are already revising their 2022 forecasts downwards.
Those aspects ""are going to be really key to how it affects the global economy and people's behavior"", said Mr Erik Lundh, an economist at The Conference Board.
Mr Lundh pointed out that ""a lot of air cargo is stored basically in the belly of passenger planes...","growth, lundh, global, raises, variant, impact, mr, world, fears, travel, economic, economist, omicron, pandemichit, economy"

One reason for the spread within schools is the fact that young children are among the last group in the population to get vaccinated.
While children have not directly suffered as much from Covid-19, often contracting the virus asymptomatically or mildly, they have not been completely spared.
A small number have developed multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a sometimes deadly paediatric condition associated with Covid-19.
A much larger number have long Covid-19 symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog that persist long after the infection.","young, hits, stalks, europe, parents, hard, return, children, shut, covid19, omicron, schools, week, virus, early"

Taking to the Sunday morning TV talk shows, White House economic adviser Brian Deese acknowledged inflation was ""high right now"" but insisted that was a worldwide trend triggered by the pandemic, and not a consequence of administration policy.
The 6.2 per cent surge in October surprised economists and the White House alike, and put Biden's administration on the defensive at a time when it would rather focus on promoting the infrastructure bill.

Yet last week, as world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the COP26 climate summit, Mr Xi - the leader many believe is China's strongest since Mao Zedong - was missing.
However, for many experts, Mr Xi's decision to stay at home since the start of the pandemic reflects a deeper shift: China, responding to acute domestic pressures and mounting hostility abroad, appears to be turning inward.
""The pandemic has been a facilitator for Xi's China to move inward and partly decouple with the West,"" says professor of political science Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University.
Against this backdrop, Mr Xi's step out of the international limelight has sparked questions at home and abroad.","turns, cop26, leader, jinping, beijing, chinas, china, pandemic, mr, xis, world, inward, xi, president"

197,Covid-19 studies being adjusted as local pandemic situation evolves: NCID,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-studies-are-being-adjusted-as-the-local-pandemic-situation-evolves-ncid,"SINGAPORE - As the Covid-19 pandemic evolves in Singapore, researchers have been shifting the focus of their studies to understand the clinical features of the virus and immunity response after infection.
The Protect study is helmed by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and conducted in collaboration with seven public hospitals as well as Duke-NUS Medical School and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
Since the start of the pandemic, the studies have looked at a range of infections, from those with severe disease to those who were reinfected.
To have a clearer understanding of immunity among those who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, NCID also coordinated a sub-study under Protect.
The Singapore Covid-19 Vaccine Immune Response and Protection Study (Scope) started in January this year.","evolves, covid19, study, local, understand, researchers, situation, pandemic, adjusted, singapore, infections, protect, studies, started, ncid, vaccine"

In July, only around 60,000 inoculated residents were allowed to take part in a vastly scaled down form of the annual haj.
The pandemic hugely disrupted both Muslim pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom that rake in a combined US$12 billion (S$16 billion) annually.
Between September 2019 and March last year, it issued 400,000 of them - only for the pandemic to crush that momentum as borders were closed.
But the kingdom is slowly opening up, and has started welcoming vaccinated foreign tourists since Aug 1.","began, arabia, umrah, muslims, inoculated, distancing, foreign, pandemic, usually, grand, mecca, mosque, social, covid19, kingdom, vaccinated, drops, pilgrimages"
