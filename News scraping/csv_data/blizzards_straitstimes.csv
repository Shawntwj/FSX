Microsoft president Brad Smith laid out a set of ""Open App Store Principles"" that will apply to the store it runs for Windows-powered computers and ""the next-generation marketplaces we will build for games"".
Principles outlined by Microsoft included allowing all developers access to its app store and not requiring them to use the technology firm's payment system for in-app transactions.

A blizzard on Monday shut Istanbul Airport down for the first time since it took over from the Ataturk Airport as the new hub for Turkish Airlines in 2019.
The city of 16 million people stood effectively still on Tuesday because of orders for drivers to stay off the streets.
The closure of Istanbul Airport - where a worker miraculously avoided injury when the roof of one of the cargo terminals collapsed under the snow - grounded flights from the Middle East, Africa, Europe and Asia.

The resort town of Murree, around 70km north-east of Islamabad, was inundated with tourists and daytrippers last week after unusually heavy snow turned it into a winter wonderland.
But a blizzard from last Friday (Jan 7) onwards felled trees and blocked narrow roads leading in and out of the town, which clings to steep hills and valleys at an altitude of 2,300m.
Officials said nearly 100,000 visitors in thousands of vehicles had thronged the town by last Friday, causing an enormous traffic jam even before the blizzard.

192,05/2019,"""If you really want to limit the number of climbers,"" Mr Ghimire said, ""let's just end all expeditions on our holy mountain.""

To be sure, the race to the top is driven by the weather. May is the best time of the year to summit, but even then there are only a few days when it is clear enough and the winds are mild enough to make an attempt at the top.

But one of the critical problems this year, veterans say, seems to be the sheer number of people trying to reach the summit at the same time. And since there is no government traffic cop high on the mountain, the task of deciding when groups get to attempt their final ascent is left up to mountaineering companies.

Climbers themselves, experienced or not, are often so driven to finish their quest that they may keep going even if they see the dangers escalating.

278,12/2016,"Q What has been your biggest investing mistake?

A Buying a company's stock without knowing what it does. Examples include Ford Motors and Dolby Digital, my first few stock purchases.

For Ford, everyone knows it as a car manufacturer but it has a huge financial arm that gives out car loans but I didn't know it existed.

I'm sitting on an 8 per cent loss. It's not catastrophic but it's about opportunity cost. Since I bought it in 2010 till today, the S&P Index is up nearly 120 per cent.

I didn't understand Dolby's business and bought it as its historical financials looked great, and am down 30 per cent from the first time I bought it. When I started to be more familiar with Dolby, I invested further. I am now up 10 per cent overall. I learnt I had to build up discipline in investing and not take the gains in the short term.

Q And what has been your best investment move?

A The biggest winner in my portfolio is Netflix, which is up 530 per cent, which I bought twice in 2011.

The first time it was at US$25 per share, then at US$16 per share and it later fell to about US$8.

Anyone would have been inclined to sell it, but I felt the business was strong.

If I didn't have the discipline to hold onto stocks that I thought would go on to do well, I'd have sold and missed out on that. I'm not selling Netflix yet as I don't look at past gains, but where firms will be in five to 10 years.

The two best investments I've made was buying Philip Fisher's book. It laid the foundation for how to think about investing and the stock market. It was a very tough read. I'd never recommend it as the first investing book to read but I was interested in what he was trying to say.
