0,3-Mar-22,Co-branding collaboration: CRUST reveals new model to help big food firms benefit from upcycling,Singapore upcycling products firm CRUST has revealed a new collaborative upcycling business model of working with big food and beverage brands to develop new co-branded products from their existing food waste.,www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2022/03/03/crust-reveals-new-co-branding-upcycling-model-to-help-big-food-firms,"CRUST is best-known for the creation of its upcycled beer​ made using surplus bread from bakeries and e-commerce platforms, and also recently soft-launched an upcycled non-alcoholic beverage line​ CROP after various challenges in 2021, aiming for a full-scale launch in March 2022.
According to CRUST Group Founder and CEO Travin Singh, in addition to the firm’s conventional business model of producing and selling its own upcycled products, it is also adding a new business model which has been dubbed ‘Sustainable Unique Label’ or SUL, which will see the firm coming in as an R&D partner for other food and beverage firms to work on the development of unique upcycled products.
“The target in particular will be big food firms that have a lot of food waste left over from their production operations which they would usually donate or throw away, as currently most of them are not aware or not able to upcycled this waste,”​ Travin told FoodNavigator-Asia​.
“In addition to SULs, we’re also planning to do a lot more in terms of special projects with high PR value to bring up consumer awareness of upcycled products, e.g.
“CROP also has an additional good point of marketing which is that it is a functional drink, as it contains parabiotics (compounds containing inactivated unused parts of probiotics) that are believed to improve microbiome health,”​ he said.","['model', 'upcycling', 'reveals', 'firms', 'cobranding', 'upcycled', 'big', 'crust', 'singapore', 'worked', 'need', 'beverage', 'help', 'collaboration', 'beer', 'food']"

Chinese plant-based meat firm HEROTEIN for example is partnering with cultured animal product company Mission Barns to develop a line of hybrid meat products.
“In terms of cost, it will take some time for the price of cultured meat to come down, and the food system needs an alternative protein option that is more affordable and available to the masses within a shorter period of time.
So hybrid products look like the best option to solve these challenges and gain consumer acceptance more quickly for the alternative protein market to grow faster.”​HEROTEIN aims to be the first to launch hybrid products within the country, which is a bold objective given that cultured meat has yet to see regulatory frameworks set up as of yet.","['protein', 'steady', 'stepbystep', 'chicken', 'products', 'consumers', 'meat', 'plantbased', 'industry', 'hybrid', 'experts', 'convert', 'real', 'cultured', 'product', 'strategy']"

With some stability on the horizon, such efforts are due to start up once again, and when FoodNavigator-Asia​ spoke with UNFAO Senior Food Safety and Nutrition Officer Sridhar Dharmapuri about this, he opined that the best way to proceed most efficiently is for the region to employ Codex Alimentarius (Codex) standards in developing the harmonised standards.
“Across Asia, the key food safety issue still plaguing the industry is that of a lack of hygiene, with microbes and microbial contamination as the number one problem, then only chemical and so on,”​ said Dharmapuri.
“It is important that there are no double standards for products which are exported versus those made for local consumption – these all need to be made to the same high safety standards,”​ Dharmapuri stressed.

However, according to Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (Carlsberg Malaysia) Managing Director Stefano Clini, the rise in profits is due to having come from a very low base in the previous year.
So despite the seemingly positive growth in profits, the firm is maintaining a very wary outlook for the rest of 2021, especially as the brewery is currently still considered a non-essential service in Malaysia.
“We saw this 16% increase for premium even in Malaysia amidst the very restricted operating environment and brewery closure, with all brands growing by double digits,”​ said Clini.

“Why have there been so many concentrated efforts made on palm oil?
“When converted into monetary terms, this substantial amount has become an envy to many other different types of oil producers so this could be a reason why palm oil [is under so much attack].
“For example, for the same brand of peanut butter produced by the same company, if you go to the Malaysian supermarket and look it will not have the Palm Oil Free/No Palm Oil label and carries the CSPO logo, but in Europe it carries a Palm Oil Free label – in clear conflict of its RSPO agreement.”​According to Vergano, the No Palm Oil labels are in something of a dubious position legally, as these may imply the claiming of better health properties just for not containing palm oil.
[There] are also clearly instances where the No Palm Oil labels are illegal under EU law because they imply that a product is better nutritionally or are implying a health claim,”​ he said.","['consumers', 'products', 'consumer', 'social', 'sentiment', 'sustainability', 'science', 'palm', 'free', 'overcome', 'experts', 'emotion', 'knowledge', 'oil', 'marketing', 'health', 'product', 'negative']"

WEF researchers proposed that China tackle this escalating problem by also looking at food waste in the value chain from production to consumption, which stands at around 30% globally, and reduce this by implementing a digitalised food supply chain from farm to fork.
“If well implemented, a digitalised food supply chain could reduce food loss by 50%.

The team combined miniature bird-borne GPS loggers, fish and squid nutritional analysis and nutritional modelling, and quantified colder and warmer water events by comparing the mean sea surface temperature with 10 years of data.
Fish and squid captured by gannets were found to have significantly lower ratio of healthy oils to protein during warm water events (where sea surface temperature was warmer than the 10-year mean) and better nutritional quality during cold water periods (lower than the 10-year mean).
Nutritional landscapeLead author Dr Gabriel Machovsky-Capuska, adjunct senior researcher at the University of Sydney, said the findings had implications for marine life and its predators, including humans.

“India’s greatest need is for an effective cold chain solution that will integrate the supply chains for agricultural commodities from their respective production centres to consumption centres, thereby reducing physical waste and loss of value of perishable commodities​,” said Pawanexh Kohli, advisor to the National Centre for Cold Chain Development.
Being largely unorganised, the supply chain suffers from a lack of transport facilities, meaning greater reliance on middlemen, he added.
In the process of bringing produce to market, losses occur in the quantity and quality of the produce, owing to improper facilities and poor handling practices employed by these intermediaries.
The doubling of farmers’ income is not possible without doubling the sales and doubling market rate of the agricultural produce, and cold chain is a key enabler to make this happen​,” added Kohli.","['improved', 'supply', 'doubling', 'produce', 'market', 'reducing', 'kohli', 'cold', 'raise', 'chain', 'need', 'farmers', 'income']"

José Graziano da Silva, the FAO’s director-general, said a focus on rebuilding farming infrastructure was more important than efforts to deliver aid.
""Ramping up investment in the recovery of the agriculture sector could dramatically reduce the need for humanitarian aid.
Less than 50% of the rural population in 2011 still lived in rural areas in 2016.

",www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2017/04/05/Adverse-weather-drives-Sri-Lankan-tea-prices-higher,"This spike was prompted by overall tea production on the island last year, which saw pickings fall to their lowest level in seven years, at just under 300m kg—down 11% year on year.
At the same time, exports were down to 288m kg, the lowest in 14 years.
According to Mintec, the commodities analyst, this was mainly due to erratic weather conditions for most of the year, as well as poor fertiliser use and a government ban on pesticides.
Last year’s supply situation was further complicated by trade union protests, as plantation workers railed over increased daily workloads and demanding higher wages.
Despite higher prices and reduced supplies, global demand for Sri Lankan tea has remained firm, with Russia, Iran, Iraq and Turkey the biggest importers.","['tea', 'lankan', 'lowest', 'drives', 'adverse', 'wagesdespite', 'prices', 'higher', 'yearsaccording', 'union', 'workers', 'workloads', 'sri', 'weather', 'turkey']"

It is believed that the stolen meat is often sold on through online forums and community buying/selling groups on social media.
The reselling of stolen meat is much less likely to arouse suspicion compared to electronic goods, such a stereos and televisions, due to the latter’s dramatic markdown in price.
“In our experience, that’s not merely because meat is an expensive item, but because it’s worth a fair amount on the black market.
We’re aware that it’s often stolen in large quantities, then sold online through social media, and we’ve even seen reports where items like bacon have been used as currency by criminals to barter.”​Auror recorded at least 20 cases of over $200-worth of meat stolen last month.","['month', 'stolen', 'auckland', 'meat', 'nearly', '10000', 'item', 'goods', 'social', 'theft', 'online', 'worth', 'retailers', 'sold', 'media']"

Despite rising for the third consecutive month, the FAO said April’s price index score of 151.8 points remains 10% below one year ago and more than one third lower than the Food Price Index highs seen in 2011.
Uneven growth​The gradual increase in food prices in recent months has been ‘far from even’, according to the FAO, which highlighted that the current rises were driven largely by a “grim 2016 production outlook for palm oil coupled with a growing worldwide demand”​ which saw palm oil prices hit a 17 month high – leading to a 4.1% spike in the vegetable oil price index.
The FAO also noted that international prices for soy, which is the second most important oil crop to influence the vegetable oil price index, rose due to less favourable 2015/16 production prospects in South America.
Sugar prices, which provided a driver for strong growth in March (growing by 17%), were down by 1.7%, while meat prices rose 0.8% on the back of growing U.S. demand for Australian beef, said the FAO.","['price', 'month', 'continued', 'rise', 'fao', 'spike', 'drives', 'rose', 'palm', 'prices', 'noted', 'index', 'oil', 'food']"

Some of these companies have expressed concern at the lack of detail in the new regulations, especially regarding tougher requirements to determine which goods can be imported through cross-border e-commerce warehouses in pilot free-trade zones in 12 cities that were given preferential tax and customs treatment.
E-commerce is witnessing something of a boom in China, where an expanding middle-class that is increasingly unsatisfied with the quality of local products has become steadily more willing to pay higher prices for products from countries where food is deemed safer, such as Australia.
China’s finance ministry unveiled a new 11.9% value added tax last month which analysts said will increase the tax burden on low-end products while lowering the tax rate for some premium items such as cosmetics.
The move was taken by authorities in a bid to level the playing field between offline and online sellers, with the latter heretofore enjoying lower tax rates on imported goods.","['effect', 'witnessing', 'products', 'willing', 'goods', 'warehouses', 'shopping', 'online', 'prices', 'imported', 'higher', 'tax', 'retailers', 'zones', 'chinas', 'mull']"

A weakening euro was compounded by an abundant supply of pork – exacerbated by Russia’s trade ban – and these factors made EU pig meat attractive to Chinese buyers, the report says.
This, in addition to a low level of consumer trust in domestic pig meat, may help the EU continue to grow its pork exports in China.","['pork', 'remain', 'report', 'meat', 'supply', 'pig', 'market', 'propped', 'exports', 'china', 'eu', 'domestic']"

Were palm oil to sustain such a rate of growth over the next decade—demand and land availability permitting—the market would come close to 100m tonnes by around 2022.
Growth will mainly be driven by Indonesia, which has more landbank available than Malaysia, especially after the country overtook Malaysia several years ago as the main palm oil producer.
Lavigne also said that weather is one of the key factors in the supply equation of oilseeds and palm oil.
Around half of Indonesian oil palm plantation is owned by private companies, with smallholders accounting for 42%, and the remaining 8% in the hands of state-owned companies.","['production', 'growth', 'land', 'india', 'vegetable', 'palm', 'rate', 'malaysia', 'lavigne', 'indonesia', 'oil', 'china', 'asias', 'consumption']"

Dr Trish Lavery said that whether whales compete with fisheries for marine resources has been hotly debated, especially in light of depleting fishing stocks in Asia.
The study also said that global declines in marine production occurred at the same time as whale stocks were being reduced during the Industrial whaling era, although a direct correlation could not be made.

Backtrack​In the clarification, Alcala said the government’s planned importation of 187,000 tonnes this year as buffer stock was only “for the lean months​,” and should not be interpreted as not being able to meet the government’s rice self-sufficiency target.
“The FSSP defines self-sufficiency as the country’s ability to meet its national food requirements, while maintaining a buffer stock to be used in times of need.
We are working to meet our per capita consumption of about 115kg per person per year, given our population of about 99m Filipinos​,” he added.

One of the things that makes South Korea such an interesting market for BASF is 2012 legislation recommending that Koreans consume at least 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day​ as part of a healthy diet, which is roughly eight times the minimum daily amount advised in Europe.
Omega-3 Pharma growth​The South Korean approval is part of a wider BASF effort to grow its pharmaceutical omega-3 fatty acid business globally that began with its purchase of Equateq and the Callanish facility in May last year.
Alan Poon, Head of BASF Pharma Ingredients & Services in Asia Pacific said: “We expect approvals in other Asian markets to follow, as we broaden our offering of omega-3 concentrates for the pharmaceutical sector even further.”Orthofer echoed this, explaining that: “The market for omega-3 based drugs is relatively young with only a few drugs approved in a few countries.​“Therefore, there are many opportunities globally to obtain regulatory approvals for existing omega-3 drugs and for future products​.”","['south', 'drug', 'drugs', 'basfs', 'market', 'opportunities', 'basf', 'scottish', 'plant', 'omega3', 'ok', 'korean', 'pharmaceutical', 'pharma']"

But, despite initial research, little is understood about the specific molecule or complex in the honey that confers this effect.
But another effect of the high price of New Zealand’s manuka honey is the apparent practice of blending high quality bioactive manuka honey with inferior or less active honeys according to one of the New Zealand Government’s research institutes, GNS Science.
Sources within the manuka honey industry believe it is hard to prove but stress that these practices must be occurring as the quantity of the highly bioactive manuka honey, which is being claimed and offered for sale at retail, appears to be far greater than the actual volume of manuka honey produced in New Zealand.
A major advantage from the research presented by the Auckland University group is that it provides a basis to detect the practice of adulteration of high value manuka honey.","['manuka', 'honey', 'way', 'findings', 'high', 'practice', 'fraud', 'food', 'specific', 'demand', 'research', 'university', 'fingerprint', 'combat', 'zealand']"
