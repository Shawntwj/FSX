This means that there is no need to discriminate against or avoid discharged Covid-19 patients as they no longer shed the virus, and hence do not contaminate the environment, NCID said yesterday.
As part of the study, which was published in scientific journal Nature Communications on May 29, researchers at NCID tested surface samples of 30 negative-pressure rooms housing Covid-19 patients at different stages of illness.
Researchers also took air samples from near the air exhausts of three of the 27 negative-pressure rooms in the general ward.
They found that surface contamination was significantly higher in the rooms of patients in their first week of illness, regardless of whether they showed symptoms.","contamination, surface, patients, peaks, samples, illness, rooms, study, ncid, air, week, covid19, virus",Food safety/contamination

There will also be no medal ceremony if Valieva - the pre-Games favourite for gold - comes in the top three on Thursday.
In a fresh twist, The New York Times reported that her sample also contained the substances Hypoxen and L-Carnitine, which are also used to treat heart conditions.
The New York Times report said the grandfather provided a pre-recorded video message to a hearing with Russian anti-doping officials on Feb 9 in which he said he used trimetazidine.

This year, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) outlined plans to discharge more than one million tonnes of the water, after treatment and dilution, from a point about 1km offshore from the power station.
Tepco submitted detailed plans on Tuesday to the nuclear regulation authority for approval, company official Junichi Matsumoto told reporters.
The water is to be processed to remove radioactive contamination, except for tritium, which cannot be removed.

But to those who are working on alternatives to single-use plastic, the consumer momentum is not disappearing.
The most important are a shelf life that is comparable to that of plastic, which helps prevent additional food waste; complete biodegradability and compostability; and the ability to be microwaved, unlike plastic.
Ocean plastic in particular has captured the public imagination and seems to be a jumping-off point for several companies developing plastic alternatives, both in source material and in the pollution they are trying to prevent.","products, ocean, say, tired, food, york, alternatives, ideas, waste, plastic, businesses, intel, companies",Food safety/contamination

146,Jul-21,"CHICAGO (NYTIMES) Tyson Foods is recalling nearly 3.8 million kg of frozen chicken that might have been contaminated with listeria, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said.

The voluntary recall was issued after USDA investigators were notified last month about two people who had been sickened with listeriosis, the department said in a statement on Saturday (July 3).

An investigation found evidence linking those cases to frozen chicken from Tyson Foods, the agency said. Investigators eventually identified three cases linked to the recalled products, including one death, the department said.

Symptoms of listeriosis, an infection caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, include fever, convulsions, muscle aches and gastrointestinal issues, according to the USDA.

The recalled products were frozen, fully cooked chicken produced between December and April, the department said. The products include chicken strips, chicken pizza and pulled chicken breasts that were sold under brand names including Tyson, Jet's Pizza and Casey's General Store.

Chinese farmers, mostly in the arid north and west, cover fields with vast amounts of ""plastic mulch"" to help maintain soil moisture and protect against pests.
""But because of excessive use and inadequate recycling, agricultural-use plastic film pollution in some regions has been getting worse and worse, and it has already become a major environmental problem holding back the green development of agriculture,"" the ministry said.
The new rules would force farmers to use only film that meets quality standards, and they must also collect plastic waste from fields before its expiry date and deliver it to approved recycling outlets.

This raises the possibility of having ecocide included under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), alongside four already recognised international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.
That, however, will certainly take years - and in the meantime, a lot more damage will be done to the biosphere.
Yet it remains historic and encouraging to put legal definition to ecocide, said legal and environmental analysts.
The effort to list ecocide as a crime has been around since the late Swedish prime minister Olof Palme proposed it at the 1972 UN environmental conference in Stockholm.","statute, gaining, legal, icc, definition, ecocide, buzz, international, recognition, environmental, crimes, possibility, environment, creating, crime, wellbeing",Food safety/contamination

155,Oct-19,"J&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it's investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall ""out of an abundance of caution.""

In a statement on Sunday J&J said: ""Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.""

In a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition.

The company also said the FDA notified it on September 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the ""most sophisticated testing techniques available.""

Gorsky's testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on December 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc.

Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found.

Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

Jim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA's findings and the recall.

J&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result.

Gorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled.

In his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company's signature products.

Sitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders.

""We had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave … talc on the market or not,"" Gorsky said at the deposition.

In the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel.

""We had the right testing procedures in place and so there was … no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,"" he testified.

If recyclable waste is rendered unrecyclable due to such practices, people may be discouraged from putting their waste in the bins.

According to the report, the market's ageing air conditioning system has malfunctioned and cannot keep fish and seafood fresh amid high temperatures since the heatwave blanketed Japan in mid-July.
This has raised concerns that the quality of the fish is being compromised, the Jiji report said.

It takes about five minutes to extract the doses using ""low dead space"" syringes designed to minimise the residual volume, she said.
It's not clear how many South Korean clinics are using the extra doses, but Mr Chung said following the official limit means throwing away potentially life-saving vaccines.
Experts were divided about the decision to extract extra doses as pooling leftover vaccine from multiple vials can lead to contamination.
With the specialised low dead space syringes, however, a full extra dose can typically be pulled from a single Pfizer vaccine vial, and as many as two extra doses from AstraZeneca's vaccine vials.","hospitals, korean, vials, workers, medical, south, vial, extra, extract, using, syringes, vaccine, doses, covid19",Food safety/contamination

The unprecedented number of aircraft grounded as coronavirus lockdowns blocked air travel - at one point reaching two-thirds of the global fleet - has created a spike in the number of reported problems as airlines return them to service.
The number of ""unstabilised"" or poorly handled approaches has risen sharply this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata).
Approaches and landings place significant demands on crew for which training and regular experience are seen as vital.

He extrapolated that across the nation's entire pig population to estimate that 2,460 tonnes of drugs are released annually. Those chemicals may then leach into water wells and streams, or contaminate manure used to fertilise vegetable fields. Traces have even been found in Shanghai's drinking water and school kids.

A crash intubation would be risky for staff because of the time it takes to put on protective equipment, and a chaotic rush into an isolation room could spread the infection.

A care plan puts everything in place for a controlled intubation, if a patient appears likely to decline.

The team talked it over, and the patient was transferred to the ICU for monitoring overnight.

But it was not long before his oxygen levels began to cause concern for Dr Surprenant.

He believed the patient had reached the stage where intubation was his best chance of survival.

Making that call meant calling in a group dubbed the Covid airway team. Early in the pandemic, the experts in both airway management and donning and doffing specialised protective gear waited on call in a hotel across the street.

The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the high levels of lead in children were a ""cause for action"", according to the report, which cited inadequate battery recycling and open-air smelters among the lead polluters.
It cited a wide range of factors responsible for high levels of lead in children's blood, from inadequate recycling of lead-acid batteries and homes with peeling lead paint to lead-laced electronic waste dumps and food contamination due to lead-glazed pottery.
While more than 95 per cent of the lead from batteries is recycled in the United States and Europe, developing economies lack the facilities to reuse the heavy metal, the study said.

Several districts of the Chinese capital put up security checkpoints, closed schools and ordered people to be tested for the coronavirus on Monday after an unexpected rise in cases linked to the biggest wholesale food market in Asia.
State-run newspapers reported that the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at Beijing's Xinfadi market amid worries about a second wave of the pandemic in China.
Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies programme, stopped short of saying packaging needs to be tested systematically following the new infections.","outbreak, tested, salmon, market, hypothesis, coronavirus, cause, xinfadi, packaging, testing, infections, worries, needs, whos, chinas, world",Food safety/contamination

The proposed cull at mink farms in southern Netherlands, the epicentre of the country's outbreak, due to have started on Friday, was aimed at preventing further contamination, two senior Dutch ministers said.
But late on Thursday, a judge before a specialised economics court postponed the cull until after a hearing on Monday in which two animal rights groups will lodge objections, the court said in a brief statement.
""Experts have always said that corona in mink posed no health risk to the general population,"" said Erwin Vermeulen, a spokesman for Animal Rights, one of the groups that lodged the complaint.

When Europeans first navigated the rivers of the Amazon rainforest, their smallpox decimated local tribes.
Deaths among Brazil's indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil's Indigenous Peoples (APIB) - a national umbrella association that brings together the country's 305 tribes.
The official figures provided by Brazil's government put the number of dead at 59, as they only classify indigenous deaths as those occurring among tribes living on reservations but not those who have migrated to cities.
Brazil's Health Ministry, which collates the data and provides medical assistance to indigenous tribes, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","paulo, indigenous, surui, brazils, provided, coronavirus, jump, tribes, deaths, spreads, village, populations, national, virus",Food safety/contamination

""Before the pandemic, global business districts were in a high-stakes race to attract talent, new business and capital.
This does not mean an end to corporate offices and the CBD, but downsizing may be on the cards.
