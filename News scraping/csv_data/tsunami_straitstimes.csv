The Chinese navy will ship bulky items such as portable cabins, tractors, generators and water pumps to Tonga in coming days, it added.
Beijing claimed it was the first to supply drinking water and food supplies to Tonga on Jan 19, although this could not be independently verified by Reuters.
The Australian and New Zealand naval vessels have also arrived in Tonga, and Canberra promised an A$3 million (S$2.87 million) in humanitarian funding to Tonga.
The United States and its Western allies worry that China is using debt to secure influence over these stratigically important Pacific island nations, claims China has repeatedly denied.","relief, million, rush, china, tsunamihit, west, water, tonga, united, drinking, navy, supplies, chinese, pacific, food"

""Everyone is still struggling right now,"" said Mr Drew Havea, the vice-president of Tonga Red Cross.
Because of the ash, ""families are making sure their kids are not playing outside, that they are all indoors"", he said.
The psychological impact of waves rushing through and destroying villages will affect their lives for some time, he said.
The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard some 2,300km away in New Zealand.","trauma, red, ring, waves, outside, residents, tsunami, struggles, tonga, eruption, ash, psychological, volcano"
2,Three tiny islands have borne the brunt of Tonga's tsunami,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/three-tiny-islands-have-borne-the-brunt-of-tongas-tsunami,"NUKU'ALOFA, TONGA (NYTIMES) - Tonga, the Pacific nation that was struck by a powerful tsunami last weekend, consists of about 170 islands, some tiny, stretching across 270,000 square miles (699,000sq km), an area roughly the size of Texas.
""Homes have been completely wiped out,"" Ms Katie Greenwood, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Fiji, said of the three islands, Nomuka, Mango and Fonoifua.
As of Saturday (Jan 22), just three deaths from the tsunami had been confirmed in Tonga.
But Ms Greenwood said Nomuka, Mango and Fonoifua were buffeted by waves almost 50 feet (15m) high, compared with waves of only 4 feet on Tongatapu.
It is by far the hardest hit of any of Tonga's inhabited islands, many of which suffered only superficial damage and extensive ashfall.","tongas, way, islands, borne, mango, tiny, fonoifua, island, tsunami, nomuka, tongatapu, damage, tonga, brunt"
3,"In Tonga, a volcano-triggered tsunami underscores islands' acute climate risk",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/in-tonga-a-volcano-triggered-tsunami-underscores-islands-acute-climate-risk,"By increasing temperatures and driving up sea levels, climate change will likely worsen disasters wrought by tsunamis, storm surges, and heat waves, experts say.
Their plea for global climate action is especially desperate, given that Pacific island nations account for only 0.03 per cent of global carbon emissions, according to the World Bank.
As sea levels continue to rise in coming decades, tsunamis and storm surges will likely be reaching further inland with even more risk of damage.
Sea water that washes ashore can taint agricultural soil and leave it useless for years.
With climate change warming the ocean's surface, such storm surges are more likely as the warm water fuels increasingly powerful cyclones.","global, acute, islands, storm, surges, volcanotriggered, waves, risk, climate, tsunami, water, tonga, sea, underscores, tsunamis"

""We know there is some significant damage, and know there is significant damage to resorts,” he said in an interview with an Australian radio station, adding that Tonga’s airport appeared to be in relatively good condition.
The eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano triggered a tsunami on the shores of Tonga and cut off phone and internet lines for the entire island.
Telephone networks in Tonga have been restored but ash was posing a major health concern, contaminating drinking water.

Tsunami alerts were issued in countries as far apart as Peru and Australia yesterday, after a trio of large quakes measuring 7.4, 7.3 and 8.1, and dozens of powerful aftershocks, struck near New Zealand's remote Kermadec Islands.
Eyewitnesses in the city said a small initial surge was visible, but did not appear to cause any damage.
New Zealand's National Emergency Management Agency said the remoteness of the quakes did not minimise their potential impact.

The highly mutated variant drove US cases to a record, the most - by a large margin - that any country has ever reported since the pandemic began more than two years ago.
Monday's number is almost double the previous record of about 590,000 set just four days ago in the US, which itself was a doubling from the prior week.
America's daily case count on Monday was more than twice the number seen in any other country at any time.

Nevertheless, the health impact of the new waves of infections has, thus far, not appeared to be as or more serious than previous waves.
Preliminary evidence suggests the Omicron variant causes milder forms of illness, often not requiring hospitalisation, particularly in vaccinated individuals.

How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?
He said the constriction of labour supply would lead to wage inflation and that he would invest in automation.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said that Britain's economy must kick its addiction to cheap imported labour and that it is positive that wages will have to go up.
His government has denied that Brexit is responsible for the strains on the economy, though no other European economies have faced the same scale of supply chain disruption.","supply, economy, labour, cheap, king, costs, soar, binge, chicken, 20year, inflation, britains, chain, cent, food"

""It's crucial that we restart nuclear power plants,"" Mr Kishida said as he faced opposition questions in Parliament for the first time since taking the top job last week.
All of Japan's nuclear power plants were shut down after the disaster, which highlighted failings in regulation and oversight.
But Mr Kishida was vague on specifics, saying that he would ""order to have the overall structure of our coronavirus policies drawn up soon"".

Last week, Quad leaders - United States President Joe Biden, and prime ministers Yoshihide Suga of Japan, Scott Morrison of Australia and Narendra Modi of India - met for their first-ever in-person summit in the East Room of the White House.
That the meeting took place just six months after the four leaders held a summit by videoconference underscores their seriousness of purpose and the attention, welcome or otherwise, that the region increasingly referred to as the Indo-Pacific has been getting lately.
The Quad's origins lie in the burst of cooperation between the militaries of the US and other regional powers to help civilian populations in the wake of the December 2004 South-east Asian tsunami whose ripples were felt as far away as Africa's eastern coast.
Hence, the Quad's emphasis on a ""free and open"" Indo-Pacific and commitment to freedom of navigation.","zone, asias, help, china, quads, indopacific, quad, goals, southeast, sea, hinder, leaders, east, summit"

Papua, Kalimantan, and Sumatra Islands are the most crucial regional mangrove ecosystems.
Indonesia's mangrove forests store around 3.14 billion metric tons of carbon, or five times more carbon per hectare than highland tropical forests, says Mr Daniel Murdiyarso, a long-time principal scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research and a leading wetlands expert.

True to the name of the Tokyo 2020 slogan, ""United By Emotion"", there has been plenty of emotion in the inspirational sporting triumphs, displays of grit, tender moments of friendship, and discussions of mental health.
Yet, the fervour is subdued in host city Tokyo, which is celebrating Team Japan athletes amid the country's best Olympic showing yet.

Outside the Olympic bubble, warnings abound that overburdened medical systems across the country are on the precipice of collapse.
This illustrates the shift in age profile as Covid-19 cases fall among the elderly - 77.1 per cent of whom are fully vaccinated - while the middle-aged are developing the worst symptoms.","touted, cases, olympic, away, amid, bubble, admitted, covid19, games, hospital, tokyo, safe, visiting, surge"

A slimmed-down, cheaper version was commissioned and the five-floor facility was unveiled in December 2019, along with a host of special features to beat the heat of the Tokyo summer.
But how many domestic fans - if any - will be allowed into the stadium during the events is expected to be decided by organisers this month.

Beijing said the ocean was the ""common property of mankind"" and the disposal of the nuclear waste water ""is not just Japan's domestic issue"".
Around 1.25 million tonnes of water has accumulated in tanks at the nuclear plant, which was crippled after going into meltdown following a tsunami in 2011.
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said that disposing of the water was an ""inevitable task"" in the decades-long process of decommissioning the nuclear plant.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has endorsed the release, which it says is similar to disposal of waste water at nuclear plants elsewhere in the world.","extremely, fukushima, nuclear, china, waste, release, tonnes, water, japans, treated, plant, irresponsible, foreign, tokyo, international"

Japan unveiled plans on Tuesday to release more than one million tonnes of water from the plant crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami into the sea once it had been treated.
South Korea strongly protested against the decision, summoning Mr Koichi Aiboshi, Tokyo's Ambassador in Seoul, and convening an intra-agency emergency meeting to craft its response.
Mr Moon also expressed concerns about the decision as Mr Aiboshi presented his credentials, having arrived in South Korea in February for the ambassador's post.
South Korea's foreign ministry issued a statement saying it had raised similar concerns with Washington, after the State Department said Japan's decision was ""transparent"" and in line with global safety standards.","fukushima, nuclear, decision, moon, mr, tokyos, release, south, water, fight, japans, sea, treated, plant, concerns, officials, seoul"
