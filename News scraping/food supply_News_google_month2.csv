0,food supply,Parents Erupt Over FDA Failure To Regulate Toxic Metals in Food,"The Food and Drug Administration has yet to take any action, despite having spent three years quietly exploring the issue of toxic contaminants in food during the Trump administration.

“This is not a baby food problem. This is a food problem,” said Tom Neltner, chemicals policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, which has lobbied for more regulation of heavy metals.

The congressional report, released earlier this month by a House Oversight Committee panel, found that four major baby food brands — Beech-Nut, Gerber, Earth’s Best Organic and HappyBABY — sold products that their own internal testing showed contained arsenic, lead and cadmium at levels far higher than what most health experts consider safe for infants.

In the days following the report, each of the baby food companies sought to reassure parents that their products are safe and that they follow very high standards for sourcing ingredients, but it’s done little to lessen the blowback.

Though in some cases the companies knew their ingredients contained elevated levels of heavy metals, the baby food makers at the center of the investigation weren’t violating any rules because the FDA has not set standards for most heavy metals in baby food.

The FDA, which has historically focused most of its attention on foodborne pathogens like Salmonella and Listeria, in 2017 launched a working group to look at heavy metals and other contaminants in food, cosmetics and supplements to little fanfare — a move that was partly a reaction to an EPA study from earlier that year that found food was a surprisingly significant source of lead exposure for young children.

A chart that was buried in supplementary material in the study showed that about half of blood lead exposure for most children between the ages of 1 and 6 comes from food. The next biggest contributors: soil and dust (including from lead-based paint), air and water.

Significant problem

It’s an important revelation because lead exposure remains a significant public health problem in the United States. One study estimated that preventing all lead exposure in just the babies born in the year 2018, for example, would deliver $80 billion in societal benefits, in large part due to the increased earnings potential of children with higher IQs and fewer behavioral and health problems.

About two million children, or nearly 10 percent of all young kids, are estimated to consume more lead than the FDA’s current limit each day, according to the government’s own estimates.

Lead is among the best-known and best-studied neurotoxins, but arsenic, cadmium, and mercury are also routinely found in foods at low levels. As scientists have begun to better understand the health risks from long-term, low-level exposure, and labs have grown better at detecting contaminants at very low levels, more attention has turned to the food supply.

The issue has been on the FDA’s radar, but there have been no changes to any food standards.

Now, with the fresh public outrage over baby food, the Biden administration faces pressure to act, even as it is still without a nominee for FDA commissioner.

The agency, in a statement to POLITICO, said it is reviewing the congressional subcommittee’s baby food report.

“The FDA takes exposure to toxic elements in the food supply extremely seriously, especially when it comes to protecting the health and safety of the youngest and most vulnerable in the population,” an FDA spokesperson said in an email, noting that heavy metals are found throughout the environment. “Because they cannot be completely removed, our goal is to reduce exposure to toxic elements in foods to the greatest extent feasible and we have been actively working on this issue using a risk-based approach to prioritize and target the agency’s efforts.”

The FDA did not respond to the criticism that it’s been slow to act on the issue, but did acknowledge “that there is more work to be done.”

The reality is that concerning levels of lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium can routinely be found in many foods, including rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, juices and spices. The contamination is happening throughout the food supply — not just in baby food — which means that parents cannot avoid heavy metals simply by making their own food.

Crops pull up heavy metals from soil, where some of the metals are naturally occurring but much of the contamination stems from more than a century of pollution, from car exhaust to coal emissions and agricultural chemicals.

Emissions spread heavy metal particles through the air where they eventually settle into soil and water. In the early 20th century, it was common for farmers to use pesticides made with lead and arsenic, especially to grow cotton in the south. Heavy metals don’t degrade, which means crops grown decades later can absorb old contaminants through their roots.

“Parents can’t solve this problem by shopping in the produce aisle and not the baby food aisle,” said Jane Houlihan, research director at Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a nonprofit focused on reducing babies’ exposure to toxic chemicals. “FDA has to take action.”

Small amounts

The good news is that the general population’s exposure to heavy metals has been going down over time, particularly after the government started phasing out leaded gasoline, paints and food cans in the 1970s, which led to a steep drop off in blood levels of lead in children. The bad news is that scientists have only recently come to better understand just how damaging heavy metals can be, particularly for babies and young children, even at very, very low levels.

Even exceedingly small amounts of these neurotoxins can impede a child’s IQ, hinder brain development, lead to behavioral problems, increase cancer risk, and raise the chances of many other diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, maintains there’s no known safe blood level of lead in children.

“What’s come into clearer view is that this is an urgent public health problem,” Houlihan said.

Right now, parents and other caretakers are essentially at the mercy of whatever standards baby food companies decide to set for themselves — and the extent to which they actually conduct their own tests and hold themselves to those internal standards.

Exactly how low the limit should be for heavy metals in baby food is a matter of debate, but public health advocates contend it should be as low as possible — and there is broad agreement that the few standards FDA currently has are not strict enough to protect babies and young children.

Back in 2013, FDA proposed a voluntary limit for inorganic arsenic in apple juice at 10 parts per billion and the agency has still not finalized the guidance more than seven years later.

Consumer Reports has since pushed for a limit of 3 ppb for all juices, arguing that the agency’s initial guidance — which companies tend to take seriously — was a step in the right direction, but didn’t do enough to mitigate the risk of developmental problems posed by arsenic exposure.

In 2016, the FDA, responding to outside pressure from Consumer Reports and others, set a voluntary limit for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal at 100 ppb, but the agency set this level based on cancer risks and what was feasible for the industry at the time, not neurological development risks, which have been shown at much lower levels. Public health advocates have urged the agency to lower this limit.

The agency has also been criticized for lax oversight. Independent tests have shown infant rice cereal makers sometimes sell products that exceed the standard with no repercussions.

Developmental harm

There are no federal standards for lead in baby food, but the FDA has set a 5 ppb lead standard for bottled water, 50 ppb for juice and 100 ppb for candy. By comparison, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a 1 ppb limit for school drinking fountains — a threshold that consumer advocates would like to see applied to juice, too.

Cadmium has received far less attention compared to other toxic metals like arsenic and lead, but it’s also prevalent in the food supply. FDA has no standards on cadmium in any foods. Consumer Reports has urged the agency to set a limit of 1 ppb for cadmium in fruit juice.

But heavy metals have prompted the greatest concern by far when found in baby food because infants and young children are the most vulnerable to developmental harm. In 2017, the Environmental Defense Fund analyzed FDA’s own routine testing of the food supply and found there were measurable lead levels in 20 percent of baby products tested.

The same year, a Colorado-based nonprofit called the Clean Label Project tested some 500 of the country’s best-selling baby foods — one the largest samples to date — and found that nearly 40 percent contained at least trace levels of one heavy metal and 25 percent contained all four, though overall the levels were relatively low.

The following year, Consumer Reports tested 50 popular baby food products and found two thirds contained “worrisome levels” of at least one heavy metal. They reported that 15 of the products tested would pose health risks to children if regularly consumed. Products containing rice and sweet potatoes were particularly likely to test positive. Organic products were just as likely to be contaminated as conventional products.

The House Oversight subcommittee got the idea to look into baby food after another report in 2019 by Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a nonprofit, tested nearly 170 products and found heavy metals present in 95 percent of their samples. Most foods had relatively low levels, but there were product categories that showed higher levels, including lead in carrots and sweet potatoes and particularly arsenic in rice. Four of the seven infant rice cereals tested exceeded FDA’s voluntary limits for inorganic arsenic. The group is urging FDA to set standards for baby food, arguing that repeated exposure at very low levels adds up and poses health risks.

The congressional report this month was based on data that companies voluntarily turned over to the subcommittee. The report reveals that many of the ingredients and products that were tested by companies themselves contained heavy metals at levels that exceed even generous voluntary limits and even some companies’ own internal limits.

“Our worst fears were confirmed,” a senior Democratic committee aide told POLITICO.

It’s difficult to draw broad conclusions about the baby food supply from the report, since it’s not clear how often companies are testing or how much of their own data they turned over to the committee, but the data that were released show numerous examples of significant levels of heavy metals getting through the supply chain and onto store shelves.

For instance, HappyBABY, an organic baby food brand, sold products that tested positive for lead at levels as high as 641 ppb and arsenic as high as 180 ppb, nearly twice FDA’s limit for rice cereal. Nearly 20 percent of the company’s finished products contained over 10 ppb of lead, according to the committee.

In a statement to POLITICO, the company said the data presented in the report was based on “a small portion” of its portfolio and is “not representative generally of our entire range of products at-shelf today.”

“We are disappointed at the many inaccuracies, select data usage and tone bias in this report,” the company said in an email. “We can say with the utmost confidence that all Happy Family Organics products are safe for babies and toddlers to enjoy, and we are proud to have best-in-class testing protocols in our industry.”

Beech-Nut, which markets itself as a “real food” brand, used nearly 90 different ingredients that had tested positive for lead at more than 15 parts per billion, including cinnamon that had been shown to be as high as 886 parts per billion.

Beech-Nut Nutrition said the company is currently reviewing the congressional report and will continue to support setting “science-based standards that food suppliers can implement across our industry.”

“We want to reassure parents that Beech-Nut products are safe and nutritious,” the company said.

Industry standards

Most of the companies targeted by the subcommittee’s investigation, including Gerber and Hain Celestial, which makes Earth’s Best Organic, are part of a group called the Baby Food Council, a partnership with Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund to set industry standards for baby food. Three other leading companies didn’t turn over testing data to the committee.

Nonetheless, the findings of the congressional report sparked concern bordering on panic by many parents and other caretakers, especially a year into a pandemic that’s upended schools, jobs, childcare and family support for millions of families.

Emily Oster, a popular economist and author on parenting issues, wrote that she was inundated with so many emails from parents that she moved her weekly newsletter up a few days to help answer questions. (She concluded that more rigorous government standards make sense and parents might consider cutting back on rice products, but should otherwise try not to worry about this too much.)

Moms flooded the social media pages of baby food brands with blistering anger. Some said they’d been in tears over the news, thinking they’d harmed their children. Several demanded to see testing results, threatened to sue, or said they were planning to take their children to the doctor to have their blood tested for heavy metals. Others said they were tossing out all their store bought food and boycotting the companies in the report.

“I have spent this last year home schooling and trying to figure [out] child care,” wrote one mom of three to Beech-Nut on the company’s Instagram page, who said her youngest had been born right at the start of the pandemic. “I have been worried sick that family would get sick. Now I learn I have something completely new to worry about.”

Every expert POLITICO interviewed for this story said it was unfortunate that parents might think they need to avoid all pre-made foods, particularly at such a stressful time.

The fact is that making baby food from scratch would probably not meaningfully reduce a child’s exposure to heavy metals. Digging deeper into the congressional report, it’s clear that many common ingredients can be contaminated and a caretaker has no way of knowing whether the sweet potatoes, kale and cinnamon in their own kitchen are any less contaminated than what baby food companies are sourcing.

The more fundamental issue, advocates say, is that there aren’t standards in place to pressure the supply chain to reduce exposure as much as possible.

“FDA has failed. They failed to set standards for baby food that companies have to meet. And they’ve failed to help, busy, sleep-deprived parents make better choices,” said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.

“The idea that new parents are going to navigate this is insane,” he added. “We’re not all nutritionists and toxicologists.”

The House subcommittee that sparked the firestorm earlier this month is planning to do more oversight on baby food, a senior Democratic committee aide told POLITICO. It makes sense to first focus on babies and small children because they are the most vulnerable to the developmental harm from heavy metals, the aide said.

“If you fail to address it here, there will be no broader action,” the aide said.

The subcommittee is working on a bill that would require FDA to come up with standards for heavy metals in baby foods and put in place testing requirements, among other things. Even if such a bill becomes law, it would likely take FDA several years to set such standards, if the agency’s past timelines are any indication.

“We don’t want to wait for that,” the committee aide said.

House Democrats are optimistic that the Biden administration will be open to working on this issue. One hopeful sign: Biden’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which sits atop FDA, is Xavier Becerra, the former attorney of California who in 2018 sued two toddler milk companies over allegations they sold products with elevated levels of lead. Becerra’s office also recently went after seafood companies for selling products contaminated with lead and cadmium.

Becerra’s crackdown on seafood processors reflects a recognition that toxic-metal contamination affects more than just baby food.

Practical steps

While parents await action from the FDA, there are some practical steps they can take to protect their children from elevated levels of metal contaminants, health and consumer advocates say: Avoid or limit rice products for infants and young children. Oatmeal infant cereal or other grain cereals, for example, can contain far less arsenic. Brown rice tends to contain higher levels of arsenic than white rice.

Rice puff and teether snacks appear to sometimes test at concerningly high levels of arsenic. Until more is known, it may make sense to swap in other snacks to cut back on potential exposure.

Parents can also cut back on juice, since apple and grape juice commonly contain low levels of arsenic and lead, and instead choose water or milk. Certain vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes, while healthy options overall, have been shown to contain more heavy metals than others, so serving a wide variety of vegetables is a good idea.

Pediatricians across the country, all of a sudden hounded by questions about heavy metal exposure, have tried to strike a balance for worried parents: Don’t panic. Focus on variety. The American Academy of Pediatrics released tips for parents, suggesting that they can also have their home water tested for heavy metals — in addition to making slight shifts in the diet — but ultimately: “Stronger rules and regulations for testing and limiting the amount of heavy metals in foods for babies and toddlers are most important.”

Phil Landrigan, a pediatrician and children’s health researcher at Boston College who played a crucial role in the government crackdown on lead decades ago, agrees that FDA action is urgently needed.

Ultimately, this is not a problem that should fall to caregivers to navigate, especially when low levels of these toxins have sweeping health consequences for future generations, he explained.

“Parents have done nothing wrong,” he said. “They’ve been hoodwinked by these companies and failed by their government.”","The agency, in a statement to POLITICO, said it is reviewing the congressional subcommittee’s baby food report.

1,food supply,Little India restaurants and stores commit to fighting food waste,"SINGAPORE - Restaurants and stores in Little India have committed to slashing food waste, and some have already started to take active measures to tackle the issue.

A ""Little India Goes Green"" campaign was launched on Saturday (Feb 27) with an introductory webinar which saw speakers from the National Environment Agency, and food distribution associations such as the Food Bank Singapore offer solutions on how to reduce and prevent food waste in restaurants and provision shops.

Little India's campaign to address food waste is organised by the women's wing of the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association (Lisha), and the Indian Restaurant Association of Singapore.

""No matter how carefully shopkeepers plan their inventory, at times, unexpected slowdown happens in businesses, causing some food to near their expiry dates,"" said Ms Joyce Kingsly, founder of Lisha Women's Wing.

""Lisha is aware of the struggles of merchants and restaurants. We are trying to find ways in which merchants could work towards clearing products that near expiry.""

There are about 70 restaurants and 200 grocery stores in Little India, said Ms Kingsly.

Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor, who delivered the opening speech at the introductory webinar, commended current efforts by some Little India shopkeepers to cut food waste.

For food products that are nearing their expiry date, she noted that many stores would sell them at a discounted price or give them to customers for free. She added that some shops are working with SG Food Rescue - an organisation that collects unsold food and redistributes them to the community - to salvage excess food, which are used to stock up community fridges.

Chennai Trading and Supermart is among those that sell nearly expired vegetables at a lower price to restaurants and customers.

""We've also sold dates, wheat flour and soft drinks at 'buy one, get one free' offers when their expiry dates are near. If the foods are very close to expiry, we will give them to customers for free, and ask them to consume before the expiry date,"" said Mr Rama Murthy, the supermart's director said.

Dr Khor pointed out that the potential for businesses to reduce food waste is immense in Little India as the area has more than 80 food-related establishments .

""The best way to reduce food waste is to avoid wasting food at the onset,"" she said.

She said more establishments, for instance, could collaborate with food distribution organisations. Businesses could also tap technology such as food waste digesters and treatment machines to convert food into animal feed, compost or fertiliser.

Dr Khor also pointed out the potential for new business opportunities from combating food waste, citing social enterprise UglyFood, which sells bruised but edible fresh produce by sourcing them from supermarkets and importers.

During the webinar, Mr S. Mahenthiran, honorary secretary of the Indian Restaurants Association of Singapore, noted that most Indian restaurants would display multiple trays of cooked food behind the counter for customers. Some of that food would not be sold at the end of the day.

""Not everything on the menu has to be prepared in advance. We can also have a chiller next to the display counter to keep marinated dishes. And upon order, you can cook the dishes. This way, you can still keep the uncooked food in the chiller for use the next day,"" he said.

Mr Mahenthiran also reminded merchants and restaurants not to be swayed by deals and discounts for bulk orders from suppliers, as some of the items could end up not being needed.","SINGAPORE - Restaurants and stores in Little India have committed to slashing food waste, and some have already started to take active measures to tackle the issue.

2,food supply,"FDA, CDC assert that COVID-19 does not transmit on packaging, food","WASHINGTON — A joint statement issued Feb. 18 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underscored “there is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19.

“Our confidence in the safety of the US food supply remains steadfast,” the agencies said. “Consumers should be reassured that we continue to believe, based on our understanding of currently available reliable scientific information, and supported by overwhelming international scientific consensus, that the foods they eat and food packaging they touch are highly unlikely to spread SARS-CoV-2.”

The statement attributed to then Acting Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Shea and Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, MD, was timely in view of continued assertions made by Chinese health officials and state media suggesting traces of the virus on imported frozen food or frozen food packaging may have been the source of the June outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing and even of China’s initial outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019. China has been pushing back against indications the global pandemic originated in China.

Chinese officials have stepped up inspections of imported frozen food in the past several months, which has led to some shipments being rejected on claims traces of COVID-19 were found on packaging. China’s trading partners, including the European Union, Canada, Brazil and the United States, said China has produced no evidence to justify its rejection of certain frozen food shipments or to the effect traces of the virus found on frozen food or packaging could lead to infection of humans.

The statement also came shortly after comments by Peter Ben Embarek, PhD, who led the World Health Organization team of scientists that recently was in Wuhan to investigate the origins of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China.

Ben Embarek during a Feb. 9 press conference, just before the team departed China, affirmed the most likely source of the virus was animals, perhaps farmed non-domesticated animals, as has been widely suspected, but the idea that the virus may somehow be transmitted to humans who come into contact with frozen foods or frozen food packaging that exhibit traces of the virus may be “worth exploring.”

At the same time, Ben Embarek in an interview with Science magazine on his return to Geneva indicated even if it were possible for an individual to be infected with COVID-19 from traces of the virus on frozen food or packaging, this would have played no role in the outbreak in Wuhan.

“China has reported over the past months a few instances where they have isolated the virus and positive samples on imported frozen products,” Ben Embarek said. “But that was happening in 2020, at a time when the virus was widely circulating in the world, when there were multiple outbreaks in food factories around the world.

“It is probably an extremely rare event. We can see that from only a few dozen positive findings in China, out of 1.4 million samples taken so far. It’s potentially possible, so it’s worth exploring. But we have to separate the situation in 2020 with imported goods in China, and the situation in 2019, where that was not a possible route of introduction. There were no widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 in food factories around the world.”

In their Feb. 18 statement, Shea and Woodcock said COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread from person to person through the air, unlike foodborne or gastrointestinal viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food.

“While there are relatively few reports of the virus being detected on food and packaging, most studies focus primarily on the detection of the virus’ genetic fingerprint rather than evidence of transmission of virus resulting in human infection,” they added. “Given that the number of virus particles that could be theoretically picked up by touching a surface would be very small and the amount needed for infection via oral inhalation would be very high, the chances of infection by touching the surface of food packaging or eating food is considered to be extremely low.”

Shea and Woodcock pointed to the Sept. 3 opinion issued by the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods that affirmed, “Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19.”

Shea and Woodcock continued, “In addition, considering the more than 100 million cases of COVID-19, we have not seen epidemiological evidence of food or food packaging as the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans. Furthermore, transmission has not been attributed to food products or packaging through national and international surveillance systems. Food business operations continue to produce a steady supply of safe food following current Good Manufacturing Practices and preventive controls, focusing on good hygiene practices and keeping workers safe.

“Based on the scientific information that continues to be made available over the course of the pandemic, the USDA and FDA continue to be confident in the safety of the food available to American consumers and exported to international customers,” Shea and Woodcock said.","“Our confidence in the safety of the US food supply remains steadfast,” the agencies said.

Food Industry Urged To Help All Indians Eat Healthy

Access To Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) analyses industry efforts to provide better nutrition in India before and since the pandemic

New Delhi, 25th February, 2021 – Today the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) is publishing in-depth thematic results and analysis on food companies’ contributions to better nutrition as part of the India Spotlight Index 2020. The Index assesses India’s 16 largest food and beverage manufacturers’ nutrition-related commitments, practices, and disclosure. The key findings published last year revealed that food companies in India show their commitment (on their websites) to provide healthy food, and to support the Poshan Abhiyaan mission and the Eat Right Movement. However, current industry efforts are not sufficient to match the scale of the nutrition challenge that the country faces and companies can and should do more. ATNI has today published the results and analysis of how the companies deal with nutrition beyond the nutritional quality of products, focusing on the following topics: Governance, Accessibility, Marketing, Employee and Consumer Lifestyles, Labeling and Engagement. The chapters also include an impression of how companies are dealing with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Dr. Rajan Sankar, Direction of Nutrition at TATA Trusts and ATNI board member says “The in-depth thematic results and analysis published by the Access to Nutrition Initiative today provides practical and actionable recommendations that must be taken on board by India’s largest food and beverage companies. If companies are to fulfill their role of providing accessible and affordable healthy food to all they must take action, particularly in the challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic, where good nutrition for all is essential as the changing situation advances and new challenges emerge.”

The detailed findings published on ATNI’s interactive website today are the results of research and analysis conducted in 2019-2020. The context has changed significantly after the start of the research with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic as food systems and families struggle to adapt to unprecedented circumstances. The food industry, particularly the companies assessed in the India Index, have a major role to play in the response to the pandemic. ATNI hopes that the findings and recommendations published today can guide companies, encouraging them to improve their nutrition practices and to provide accessible and affordable healthy food to all, according to the press release.

Some of the specific findings and recommendations from the analysis published today:

Governance

It is essential that India’s leading food and beverage companies focus more than ever on healthy diets and good nutrition during crisis. They should redouble their efforts to adhere to all relevant product standards, responsible marketing practices and responsible use of health and nutrition claims in line with government/Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) guidance. Full Governance report available here.

Products (previously published 2020)

The number of companies voluntarily fortifying their products with vitamins or minerals essential to combat hidden hunger has increased. Product fortification should be further intensified and efforts to ensure such products reach those who need them increased, as recommended by FSSAI. Less than a third (27%) of the companies’ total sales of packaged foods and beverages comes from healthy products. More innovative, healthy and affordable products can and should be introduced to make a real difference. Full Products report available here.

Accessibility and affordability of healthy food

In India, food and nutrition security for the poor deserves special attention, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chain disruptions can cause food price rises, increasing the overall cost of nutritious foods, making a healthy and diverse diet less affordable. Companies in India play an important role in ensuring the accessibility and affordability of healthy products; for example, by not increasing the price of healthier products despite the economic shocks of COVID-19. Currently none of the India-based companies have made commitments on their websites to keep prices low. Read more about the Indian food industry’s response to the pandemic in ATNI’s recently published Covid-19 report. Full Accessibility and Affordability report available here.

Marketing

Screen or online time for many Indian children 5 to 15 years old has doubled since the first lockdown. Changes in livelihoods and lifestyles, including lockdown measures, could significantly worsen childhood overweight and obesity problems. None of the companies currently have a reference on their websites reiterating any commitment to responsible marketing to children during the pandemic. Only 12% of products analysed, using the WHO nutrient profiling model for East Asia, were found to be fit to be marketed to children. ATNI urges companies not to relax existing marketing commitments particularly to children and recommends that they continue to prioritize marketing of healthier products. Full Marketing report available here.

Healthy eating and lifestyles of employees and consumers

Indian food companies prioritized the health and safety of their employees during the COVID-19 crisis. Protecting support to breastfeeding working mothers should be part of that strategy. Job loss prevention of own employees as well as for support to suppliers is another important strategy to safeguard food supply to Indian consumers. Full Lifestyles report available here.

Labeling and claims

As the consumption of packaged foods and beverages in India rises, which is also evident during the pandemic, accurate and interpretive labelling showing nutrition information becomes more important. ATNI encourages companies to (re)commit to better nutrition labelling. Including use of claims in line with Codex or FSSAI guidance and progressive front of pack labels that will help consumers to make healthy choices. Companies should reinforce commitments to base any claims only on scientific evidence, and in alignment with the regulations of the FFSAI. Full labelling and claims report available here.

Engagement

The India Spotlight Index 2020 highlights the critical need for food and beverage companies to assume a central role in the Indian Government’s Eat Right Movement. In the ATNI Covid-19 project companies also assessed in this Index were examined in relation to their responses to the pandemic. ATNI found that companies can and did support government actions and efforts to assist the most vulnerable sections of society during the COVID-19 pandemic and improve access to food. Companies also work with international organizations, academic experts and/or NGOs to inform their nutrition-sensitive strategies and interventions. Full Engagement report available here.

The full India Spotlight Index interactive report is available here: http://bit.ly/37ZYogN

ATNI encourages companies, NGOs, government, and investors to utilize these findings and continue their engagement with ATNI as we collectively work to contribute to an environment that empowers consumers in India to make informed, healthy choices.

ATNI will soon be organizing an online event to share these findings with stakeholders and also to discuss the findings of the recently published third ATNI Covid-19 report which features an in-depth look at the nutrition situation in India and how the government and food industry has responded to the pandemic.

4,food supply,Brexit: shortages and delays will grow say supply chain reps,"Food and drink producers are beginning to report stock shortages as a result of hauliers in the EU refusing to send drivers to the UK. This is being attributed to fears about the significant potential for delays and the additional costs they might have to bear.

Dave Howorth, executive director at supply chain consultancy Scala, said issues were only now beginning to emerge because businesses were starting to deplete the stockpiles they built in 2020 to safeguard against Brexit-related disruption.

“As for whether the situation could worsen from here, there are several main factors to consider,” ​he added. “Firstly, exporters, importers and hauliers alike should become more accustomed to the new processes and documentation, which will make for more efficient operations.​

“However, on the other hand regulations are set to become tighter still from April 3rd which, when taken alongside the current difficulties, may lead to hauliers becoming fatigued and potentially pulling out of operations between the UK and the EU.”​

Seasonal shifts​

Howorth also warned producers to be mindful of seasonal shifts altering the demand for various goods.

“For example, as summer approaches volumes of salad produce and fruit from the continent will increase, which hauliers, importers and exporters must be prepared for,”​ he continued.

Currently, it is mainly hauliers and logistics firms operating within the EU that are refusing to send drivers into the UK.

As William Walker, managing director at Walker Logistics, explained: “We have experienced delays at customs for product and some extended time frames that seem to be ‘random’ in nature, so would question the structure and protocols here, but not any refusals yet.”​

The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS) expected the situation to get worse. It reports more than half of UK businesses say delays have become longer since the beginning of January – 30% of those said new border rules were to blame.

Hopes fade fast ​

As we move into the third month under the new arrangements, CIPS said hopes were disappearing of fewer border delays as freight volumes return to normal and customs systems adjusted to new processes.

John Glen, CIPS economist and visiting fellow at the Cranfield School of Management, warned further delays should be expected, increasing pressure on supply chains and affecting the timely delivery of much-needed goods.

“The paperwork required at the border is not going to change anytime soon, so we should brace ourselves for these delays to continue for at least the next few months,” ​said Glen.

“New requirements for import certifications are also rapidly approaching and these will only add to the paperwork required, causing further delays for businesses. The knock-on impact of these delays will trickle far down the supply chain and ultimately result in stock shortages and inflated prices for consumers.”​","Food and drink producers are beginning to report stock shortages as a result of hauliers in the EU refusing to send drivers to the UK.

5,food supply,Beyond Meat secures McDonald’s supply deal as the first McPlant burgers roll out in Europe,"The US plant-based meat alternative company will be McDonald’s ‘preferred supplier’ for the patty in its McPlant.

The first McPlants hit Europe​

McDonald’s is testing its new plant-based burger in selected restaurant locations globally, starting in Europe.

The first local market tests kickstarted in Sweden on 5 January 2021 and will run through until 15 March at nine restaurant locations. McDonald’s also rolled out the McPlant into 14 restaurant locations in Denmark on 19 January. These tests will conclude on 12 April.

The fast-food restaurant expects to test other markets later this year and into the future, with sites selected according to local demand.

The burger is the first product in the McPlant range, but Beyond Meat revealed it will explore co-developing other plant-based menu items with McDonalds, such as plant-based options for chicken, pork and egg.

Recipe details were not disclosed, but the most recent iteration of the Beyond Burger includes a combination of proteins sourced from peas, mung bean, and brown rice.

French ingredients specialist Roquette is a supplier of pea protein isolate – the product’s main ingredient – to Beyond Meat. Last year, the companies embarked on an updated, three-year agreement​ to ‘significantly’ boost the amount supplied, compared to 2019 figures.

A ‘milestone’ agreement for Beyond Meat​

For McDonald’s, the McPlant platform will help increase consumer choice. “We’re excited to work with Beyond Meat to drive innovation in this space, and entering into this strategic agreement is an important step in our journey to bring delicious, high quality, plant-based menu items to our customers,” ​said McDonald’s Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer Francesca DeBiase.

Beyond Meat said the strategic global agreements represent an ‘exciting milestone’ for the Los Angeles-based food tech company. “We will combine the power of Beyond Meat’s rapid and relentless approach to innovation with the strength of McDonald’s global brand to introduce craveable, new plant-based menu items that consumers will love,” ​said Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown.

The news comes less than one year after Beyond Meat opened its first manufacturing facility in Europe,​ in partnership with Dutch meat company Zanderbergen. The co-packing site is located in Zoeterwoude in the western Netherlands.

Last year, the company also acquired its first Beyond Meat-owned facility outside of Missouri in the US: a facility in Eschede in the east of the Netherlands that allows for end-to-end manufacturing capabilities in Europe.

Yum! Brands ink supply deal​

At the same time, Beyond Meat also announced a global strategic partnership with Yum! Brands to co-create plant-based protein items for its restaurant chains KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

“We are honoured to enter into a global strategic partnership with Yum! Brands, one of the world’s largest restaurant companies. We look forward to expanding our work with the teams at Yum’s iconic KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands to together bring truly delicious plant-based product innovation to consumers,” ​said Beyond Meat’s Brown.

Yum! Brands said it is excited about the ‘long-term potential’ plant-based protein menu items have to attract more customers, especially younger consumers. “We expect this Beyond Meat partnership to strengthen our brands’ capability to offer delicious, plant-based menu items that are driven by consumer demand for more diverse protein options and our brands’ strategies in local markets.” ​

Both deals were welcomed by the Good Food Institute (GFI) – an NGO that promotes clean meat and plant-based alternatives to animal products – which said McDonald’s and Yum! Brands will bring plant-based meat onto mainstream menus.

“When these restaurant chains move, the entire food industry takes notice,” ​said GFI executive director Bruce Friedrich. “These agreements will reverberate throughout the global supply chain and send a strong signal for the future of plant-based meat in restaurants.” ​","The US plant-based meat alternative company will be McDonald’s ‘preferred supplier’ for the patty in its McPlant.

6,food supply,"Beyond Meat clinches coveted deals to supply McDonald's, Yum Brands","CHICAGO (REUTERS) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat said on Thursday (Feb 25) it has signed multi-year supply deals with McDonald's and Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands, underscoring consumers' appetite for vegetable-based alternatives and Beyond Meat's leading position.

But its shares lost early gains as the company reported sales and a loss that widely missed analyst expectations for the second quarter in a row.

The plant-based meat industry has developed a frenzied following in recent years, and companies like Beyond Meat and rival Impossible Foods are among top players competing aggressively for deals with major food chains. A deal with McDonald's, in particular, is highly coveted in the industry.

Beyond Meat said its three-year global deal with McDonald's would make it the world's biggest restaurant chain's ""preferred"" supplier for the patty in its new McPlant burger. The two companies will also develop other menu items like plant-based chicken, pork and eggs. Beyond Meat said it will also create a plant-based menu for Yum! Brands' KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell menus.

Given that both McDonald's and Yum! typically work with multiple suppliers, it is likely that Impossible Foods and other rivals still have a shot at working with the two fast-food chains.

""The use of the word 'preferred' there is intentional on the McDonald's side,"" Beyond Meat Chief Executive Ethan Brown said.

The maker of the Beyond Burger also supplies Starbucks, Denny's and Dunkin' Brands.

Coronavirus lockdowns have hurt sales of Beyond Meat's burgers, meatballs and sausages over the past two quarters. The company said it expects the recovery in its restaurant business to lag that of the broader food service sector.

""We're starting to see a little bit of stabilization in food service,"" chief executive Ethan Brown said.

Beyond Meat reported an increase in net sales of 3.5 per cent to US$101.9 million (S$135.4 million) in the period ended Dec 31, missing analysts' forecast of US$104.8 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The company booked US$3.7 million in Covid-19 expenses as it had to write off inventory associated with food service products that could not sell.

Beyond Meat's loss widened to US$25.1 million, or 40 cents per share, from US$452,000, or 1 cent per share. Excluding items, Beyond Meat's loss was 34 cents per share, handily missing analysts' estimate of 13 cents per share.

The company did not update its suspended outlook, saying the impact of Covid-19 made it difficult to forecast demand.","CHICAGO (REUTERS) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat said on Thursday (Feb 25) it has signed multi-year supply deals with McDonald's and Taco Bell owner Yum!

7,food supply,"McDonald's new chicken sandwich could boost Tyson Foods, Pilgrim's Pride and other poultry suppliers, analyst says","McDonald's new line of chicken sandwiches could lift all chicken suppliers, particularly Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride, said a Bank of America Securities report released Thursday.

The fast-food giant launched its Crispy Chicken Sandwich nationwide on Wednesday, spurred on by increased competition with Chick-fil-A and the success of Popeyes' version.

McDonald's is somewhat tight-lipped about the identity of its suppliers, but analyst Peter Galbo predicts that Tyson is one of McDonald's biggest chicken suppliers, thanks to its 2018 acquisition of Keystone Foods. Moreover, roughly a fifth of Tyson's chicken portfolio consists of smaller size birds, which tend to be used in chicken sandwiches, Galbo wrote.

Another beneficiary of the chicken sandwich wars is Pilgrim's Pride. It's one of Chick-fil-A's biggest suppliers, and about a third of its portfolio is devoted to smaller birds. Galbo also noted that Pilgrim's Pride is converting one of its facilities from large bird to small bird to meet increased demand.

McDonald's outsized market influence could raise prices across the category, even if processors aren't supplying the fast-food giant. According to Galbo, McDonald's holds a 30% market share in the fast-food sector, and it has a track record of influencing commodity prices. The increased competition could also drive more advertising around chicken sandwiches from rivals such as Restaurant Brand International's Popeyes, further fueling demand.

So far in February, chicken breast prices are up about 45% compared with January's prices, according to Galbo.

Shares of Pilgrim's Pride are roughly flat over the last year, giving it a market value of $5.5 billion. Meat giant JBS owns 82% of Pilgrim's Pride shares. Tyson's stock has fallen 4.7% in the same time, giving it a market value of $24.9 billion.","McDonald's new line of chicken sandwiches could lift all chicken suppliers, particularly Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride, said a Bank of America Securities report released Thursday.

8,food supply,TradeCafe raises $10 million from Round13 amid pandemic’s impact on food supply chain,"TradeCafe, a Toronto-headquartered company offering an online platform for the trade of protein commodities, has raised new funding as the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupts the global food supply chain.

TradeCafe claims it has helped facilitate more than $2 billion in trade transactions to date.

The $10 million CAD investment, solely-sourced from Toronto-based Round13 Capital, brings TradeCafe’s total funding to date to $43 million. As part of the deal, John Eckert, Round13 Capital co-founder and managing partner, has joined TradeCafe’s board of directors.



TradeCafe offers an online trading platform that provides price discovery, price transparency, finance, and transaction fulfillment to global producers, processors, and distributors of physical protein commodities, which includes meat, dairy, soybeans, and legumes.

Founded in 2015, TradeCafe is used by primary producers and processors, retailers, and distributors. When goods are traded on the platform, TradeCafe makes money through their fulfilment. The company claims it has more than 1,000 corporate entities using its platform around the world, and has helped facilitate more than $2 billion in trade transactions to date.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global food supply chain, including the trading of proteins. Reports estimate that due to the pandemic, the loss of production capacity of slaughter plants fell by 25 percent for beef, 43 percent for pork, and 15 percent for poultry.

According to RTI International, a nonprofit research organization, this decline in production has resulted in a reduction in supply, leading to higher food prices for consumers, and increased food insecurity.

Over the last year, Canada’s tech sector has mobilized to improve the food supply chain amid this industry-wide disruption. One Canadian project led by tech startup FoodMesh, aims to create an emergency food distribution network and improve the efficiency of the food supply chain. That project received federal funding through the Digital Technology Supercluster in August.

TradeCafe’s platform also allows users to create and upload trading documents, automatically generate invoices, and track products from farm to delivery point. Users can also plot pricing history to visualize market trends and manage cash flow cycles.

CEO Nicholas Walker said TradeCafe is helping many companies in protein industries during the pandemic by allowing them to access documentation on the platform while working from home.

“They don’t need to be in their office downloading time-sensitive documents, they can do it remotely, in real-time time on the platform,” Walker said.

Walker claimed that TradeCafe has seen a 25 percent increase in transaction volume, and a 40 percent increase in revenue, in the last year alone.

The new funding will be used by TradeCafe to continue its global expansion, extend the reach of its technology to new markets, and continue research and development for its trading platform.

TradeCafe is currently used in 38 countries, and Walker told BetaKit the company plans to double that, with a focus on expanding on European markets and Southeast Asia.

10,food supply,Grocery: Food Supply Under Federal Review,"The events of the past year have showcased many businesses’ resilience, but not all were able to make it through unscathed. Businesses have collapsed, jobs have been lost, stores have closed and salaries have been cut. When it came to food production, the supply chain was impacted at every level, highlighting just how unprepared the industry was for such a crisis.

Now, to prepare the industry for future crises and address vulnerabilities in the system, the presidential administration is ordering a review of the supply chain. On Wednesday (Feb. 24), President Biden signed an executive order that, according to the White House statement, “launches a comprehensive review of U.S. supply chains and directs federal departments and agencies to identify ways to secure U.S. supply chains against a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities.”

The six sectors named in this order include agricultural commodities and food production. The order calls upon federal agencies to “make specific policy recommendations to address risks, as well as proposals for new research and development activities.” It requires a year-long, comprehensive review that will identify points of vulnerability and will involve consultations with “outside stakeholders, such as those in industry, academia, non-governmental organizations, communities, labor unions and state, local, territorial and tribal governments.” The review could help prevent the sort of grocery store shortages experienced early on in the pandemic.

Gelson’s Markets To Be Acquired By Multibillion-Dollar Japanese Retail Group

Gelson’s Markets, a high-end grocery store in Southern California, will be acquired by Pan Pacific International Holdings (PPIH), a Tokyo-based company that operates 638 stores internationally. The deal will likely close in the second quarter of the year, reports Progressive Grocer. PPIH, which most recently reported US$15.8 billion in yearly revenue, operates, among others, Japan’s famous Don Quijote discount department stores. Several of its chains have expanded into the U.S., with locations in Hawaii and California. Gelson’s is being sold by private equity firm TPG Capital, which acquired the chain in 2014.

“As we look to the future, we are excited about opportunities for new growth and partnerships under PPIH, while remaining focused on our longtime commitment to the highest standards of quality, value and unsurpassed customer service,” Gelson’s President and CEO Rob McDougall said in a statement excerpted in Progressive Grocer. “PPIH leadership has visited every one of our locations and has been incredibly complimentary of our stores and teams, as well as our customer service philosophy.”

PPIH President and CEO Naoki Yoshida added that PPIH looks forward to “satisfying customers who value quality products, cleanliness, convenience and personal service.”

Publix Incentivizes Employee Vaccinations With Gift Cards

Several grocery stores are offering to compensate employees for the time it takes to get the COVID-19 vaccine, incentivizing them to stay safe and to help build herd immunity. Kroger is providing a flat $100 payment, Instacart is offering a $25 stipend, and Trader Joe’s and Target are incentivizing employees with an additional four hours’ pay.

Now, Publix Super Markets is getting into the incentives game with a higher value but more limited offer — eligible employees who show proof that they have been inoculated will receive a $125 Publix gift card, reports Supermarket News. Publix also offers the vaccine in several states, though employees are eligible for the gift card whether or not they receive their vaccines at a Publix pharmacy.

Perhaps a gift card that can only be used at one’s workplace is not the most exciting reward, but the value is significantly higher than even the more generous vaccination bonuses offered by competitors — and, of course, the gift cards will be convenient to redeem. Unfortunately for these employees, there is no employee discount at Publix, according to Indeed, so the $125 value will not be compounded by additional offers.

Walmart Pilots Bagless Initiative In Vermont

As consumers increasingly factor retailer values into their buying decisions, plastic waste has become a hot-button issue for eco-minded shoppers. In light of the increased attention placed on this waste, Walmart has been announcing initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint. Now, according to a company blog post on Monday (Feb. 22), the superstore is piloting a “bagless” program in Vermont.

This bagless initiative does not actually eliminate the retailer’s use of disposable bags. Rather, it requires that any bags given out by the company be paper rather than plastic. As the post states: “Key learnings from the final outcome of the pilot will be used to determine the future direction for our company’s bagless efforts.”

Meanwhile, all of Walmart Mexico y Centroamerica is going entirely bag-free. By the end of 2020, almost three-quarters of the stores in the region did not provide disposable bags. The post explains, “instead of offering yet another single-use solution, we made the decision to go fully bagless and encourage our customers to look to reusable bags.”

11,food supply,"India's groundwater crisis threatens food security for hundreds of millions, study says","(CNN) Hundreds of millions of people in India face a serious threat to their livelihoods and food security due to overexploitation of vital water supplies, according to the authors of a new study.

India is one of the world's biggest crop producers and more than half of its 1.3 billion people rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. But the groundwater that makes up 40% of the country's water supply has been steadily depleting for years.

The study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, found that overuse of groundwater could cause winter harvests in some regions of the country to fall up to two thirds by 2025.

A team of international researchers analyzed satellite imagery and census data to gauge the impact on winter harvests, which account for 44% of the country's annual cropped acreage for food grains, according to the study. Winter agriculture relies heavily on groundwater irrigation -- as opposed to other seasons that can take advantage of heavy monsoon rains.

Indian food production has skyrocketed since the 1960s, as farmers began widely using tube wells, which draw water from deep underground. This has allowed them to continue farming even during dry seasons when there isn't rain or sufficient surface water -- but over-extraction has left ""critically low groundwater availability"" in the country's northwest and south, according to the research.

""Many studies have shown that India has large groundwater depletion, but to date it has been unclear what the impacts of this depletion could have on agricultural production,"" said lead author Meha Jain, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability.

The researchers found that if farmers in over-exploited regions lose all access to groundwater, and if that irrigation water isn't replaced by water from other sources, winter harvests could decrease by 20% nationwide and by 68% in the most severely affected areas.

This is a worst-case scenario, and the damage could be mitigated if authorities take action and adopt alternative irrigation options, the study said. The government has already been widely pushing the adoption of canal irrigation, which diverts surface water from lakes and rivers, and could help offset some of the losses.

Water commuters fill containers at a groundwater source in Latur, Maharashtra, India, in 2016.

But it's far from a perfect solution -- even if all regions currently using depleted groundwater switched to canal irrigation, winter harvests could still decline by 7% nationwide and by 24% in the worst hit locations, according to the study.

And canal irrigation comes at its own cost -- it would mean farmers are more vulnerable to weather changes, since lakes and rivers depend on rainfall. Groundwater is also a more equitable way to distribute water across villages, since wells are decentralized as opposed to large-scale canal projects.

""Our results highlight the critical importance of groundwater for Indian agriculture and rural livelihoods, and we were able to show that simply providing canal irrigation as a substitute irrigation source will likely not be enough to maintain current production levels in the face of groundwater depletion,"" said Jain in a news release.

Instead, the government needs to adopt a wide range of strategies -- for instance, switching from winter rice to less water-intensive cereals, the use of sprinklers and drip irrigation to conserve water, and policies to increase the efficiency of irrigation canals, according to the study.

Farmers hard hit

India's water crisis has been building for years, gaining international attention in 2019 when Chennai, the country's sixth largest city, faced an acute water shortage.

The city's four main reservoirs ran nearly dry due to insufficient rainfall and low groundwater levels. Water had to be trucked into Chennai from other states and regions, forcing hundreds of thousands of residents to stand in line for hours in the summer heat to receive rationed water.

It's a national problem: 100 million people, including those in the large cities of Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad, face the threat of groundwater running out entirely, according to a 2018 report by Niti Aayog, an Indian government think tank

A man fills up a container with drinking water during a citywide water shortage in Chennai, India, on June 17, 2019.

The agricultural sector has been one of the hardest hit. The regions with the most severe water depletion fall along India's food bowl -- states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which support the whole country's food security, said Bharat Sharma, scientist emeritus at the International Water Management Institution, who was not involved in the study.

""The water table is depleting very fast in north India ... That is why the farmers started making use of groundwater, because surface water was not available and the explosive use of groundwater began,"" he said. ""The cropping system we are using requires more water than is available.""

The devastating effects of climate change have also added to the difficulties facing farmers. Monsoon rains, which they depend on to water their crops, have been more erratic and droughts more common.

""Indian farmers are in a very challenging situation right now,"" Jain, from the University of Michigan, told CNN. ""On top of groundwater depletion, there's also going to be negative impacts of climate change in the coming decades.""

This years-long crisis has been linked to persistently high rates of farmer suicide, with many farmers driven to desperation by growing debts, bankruptcies and crop loss. Every year, more than 10,000 farmers and agricultural workers die by suicide, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau . In 2019, that number was 10,281 -- averaging 28 suicides a day.

The government has taken action in recent years to try to address these various crisis points. In 2020, the federal Central Ground Water Board agency released a ""Master Plan"" to conserve and artificially recharge depleted groundwater, using strategies like canals, injection wells, and groundwater reservoirs.

One sustainable solution could be changing the types of crops grown in different regions -- for instance, reducing up to 20% of the land used to grow rice and wheat in Central Punjab, said Sharma. These are thirsty crops -- replacing a portion with less water-reliant crops could turn the land ""water neutral,"" meaning ""the rate of depletion of water will be equal to the rate by the recharge.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi made agriculture a key focus of his 2019 re-election campaign, pledging to double farmers' incomes by 2022. After he won, Modi created the Jal Shakti Ministry, a government branch focused on water resources, conservation and sanitation.

But efforts by Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party to reform the agricultural sector have backfired. A series of new agricultural laws passed last September have prompted the biggest nationwide protests seen in years, that are still ongoing now months later.

Though the government says the laws are necessary to modernize the industry and grant farmers more autonomy, farmers fear the laws could instead allow big companies to drive down prices, thus further devastating their livelihoods.","(CNN) Hundreds of millions of people in India face a serious threat to their livelihoods and food security due to overexploitation of vital water supplies, according to the authors of a new study.

13,food supply,New bill looks to supply schools with Nebraska-grown food,"LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) -A new initiative is trying to keep Nebraska-grown food right here in the Cornhusker State by connecting schools and local growers. This bill means Nebraska farmers could have one more place to sell produce and one local farmer said it could have a tremendous economic impact.

From the ground to the package, food production is happening at Robinette Farms. Soon their arugula, spinach and microgreens, could make their way to children’s lunch tray, all because of a bill by Senator Tom Brandt.

“It’s an effort to get high-quality Nebraska foods into our local school system,” said Sen. Brandt, Dist. 32.

The Farm-To-School Program would purchase locally-produced food for local public and non-public schools and increase farm-to-school activities statewide.

The bill is two-fold, meant to improve childhood nutrition and strengthen local farm economies.

“A lot of folks think we grow corn, beans and beef in this state and we can’t grow anything else,” said Alex McKiernan, the co-owner of Robinette Farms. “We’re always trying to encourage people to be aware of the food we can grow here.”

The new legislation would move $100,000 from the state’s general fund to support the program.

“The return on investment would be many times over to keep those food dollars in the state of Nebraska,” said Sen. Brandt. “And it will help producers and market gardeners to create a bigger book of business.”

“Although agriculture makes up 50% of the GDP in this state, we import 90% of the food we eat and we just don’t need to,” said McKiernan.

The bill is also designed to get kids interested in agriculture with hands-on opportunities.

“It’s creating a new class of leaders that can take agriculture in the new direction,” said McKiernan. “It’s just one step along the way.”

14,food supply,Wisconsin teachers will be eligible for the vaccine starting Monday,"State health officials say they are ready to move forward with the second half of Phase 1B next week — and educators will be first in line.

Now that nearly half of Wisconsinites ages 65 and up have received their first dose of vaccine, ""we are definitely moving forward with March 1,"" DHS deputy secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at a press briefing Tuesday.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is encouraging providers to vaccinate people in Phase 1B based on a specific order established last month when the department finalized which groups would be eligible for the phase. The groups, in priority order, are:

Education and child care workers

People in Medicaid long-term care programs such as IRIS and Family Care

Public-facing essential workers, such as 911 operators, public transit workers, utility workers and food supply chain workers, including agricultural workers and retail food workers

Non-frontline health care personnel

People in congregate living, such as those in mental health institutions or people who are incarcerated

Mink husbandry workers

Some advocates have questioned how groups were prioritized. Disability Rights Wisconsin attorney Mitchell Hagopian, who sits on the DHS volunteer vaccine advisory committee, said state health officials ranked the sub-groups in Phase 1B without input from the committee.

He said he was ""disappointed"" by the department's decision to roll out vaccinations in a tiered manner.

""In effect, DHS has crowded out the Family Care, IRIS and other vulnerable populations,"" Hagopian said. ""[Disability Rights Wisconsin's] position is that all eligible populations should have equal access to the vaccine from the date they become eligible. The only preferences should be related to assuring adequate supply to underserved communities.""

At the press briefing Tuesday, Willems Van Dijk said it is necessary to get educators vaccinated as quickly as possible.

""This is a group that is essential,"" Willems Van Dijk said. ""We want our kids in school ... and we know teachers work every day with a population that is not able to be vaccinated because of their age.

""The important thing for people to remember is a shot in the arm is another person protected in the state,"" she added. ""We will all get our turn.""

Willems Van Dijk also emphasized that people who are 65 or older who have not yet received their vaccine will not be crowded out, noting that the federal allotment of vaccines to Wisconsin has increased from roughly 70,000 doses per week to 115,000 doses per week.

""I understand if you’re in the half of folks 65 and older who have not yet received your vaccine that you may be anxious about whether you’re ever going to get one, and I can assure you you will,"" Willems Van Dijk said. ""There is more vaccine coming.""

Teachers at the front of the line

At least one school district has already begun scheduling teachers and staff for vaccination appointments.

Green Bay Area Public School District spokesperson Lori Blakeslee said the district worked with Prevea Health to schedule vaccination appointments for teachers starting next Monday and Tuesday. Staff were able to sign up for appointments starting Monday evening, Blakeslee said.

Meanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools staff have not received formal communication from administration about vaccination plans as of Tuesday, said Angela Harris, chair of the Black Educators Caucus MKE.

Harris, who teaches first grade at Dr. King Jr. Elementary, said she plans to call her doctor on Monday to schedule an appointment.

""You would hope they would have some sort of plan in place for teachers to get vaccines before a conversation about us coming back to school in person,"" Harris said.

Milwaukee Public Schools spokesperson Shahree Douglas did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Jeff Fleming, spokesperson for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, said local health officials have not finalized logistical plans for offering vaccines.

Fleming said there will likely be specific resources dedicated to vaccinating school staff, which could include special mobile vaccination sites or dedicated vaccination hours set aside for school staff. It’s not clear when the plans will be finalized, Fleming said.

After educators and childcare workers, frail adults with disabilities in Medicaid long-term care programs like IRIS and Family Care will be next in line. State health officials said they will work closely with the managed care organizations that provide care to the IRIS and Family Care programs to be accountable for identifying people who need vaccine.

After that comes public-facing essential workers like transit workers and grocery store employees.

People in congregate living, such as those in mental health institutions and people in prison, are last on the list next to mink farm workers.

Wisconsin Department of Corrections spokesperson John Beard directed questions about timing vaccinations for inmates to DHS, but said in an email that the department ""is prepared to vaccinate persons in our care per DHS criteria and vaccine availability.""

Department of Corrections health care and correctional staff are already eligible and are in the process of being vaccinated, Beard added.

Phase 1C still not finalized

Who will qualify for the next round of vaccinations, known as Phase 1C, has yet to be finalized.

Past discussions have focused mostly on people with underlying medical conditions who are more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19.

More:Next phase of Wisconsin's vaccine plan could begin in April, health officials estimate

Frontline health care workers, police and fire personnel and people 65 and up are already eligible for the vaccine.

The State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee, a volunteer group of 16 public health experts, has been on hiatus for several weeks because state health officials said they needed time to understand how the Biden administration might change the federal vaccination strategy.

Willems Van Dijk said the department is waiting for further recommendations on phasing from the federal government before resuming the meetings.

""We're working on getting through this beginning of Phase 1B,"" Willems Van Dijk said. ""Then we'll be working on considering who will be in 1C.""

Vaccine rollout ramping up as cases decline

About 90% of available COVID-19 vaccine doses have been used in Wisconsin, a data point health officials touted Tuesday as evidence of the state's ramped-up rollout.

The statistic comes from data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was compiled by the organization Our World in Data.

The state ranks fifth in the nation in the usage metric, trailing Montana, New Mexico, West Virginia and North Dakota.

Also Tuesday, the state announced it is opening four more community vaccination clinics after the the success of its clinic in Rock County.

That clinic receives about 1,000 doses of the vaccine per week, which can allow up to 200 people per day to receive the vaccine, at no cost.

The new clinics — slated to open in the next two months — will be in Racine, La Crosse and Marathon counties, with the fourth split between Douglas and Barron counties.

Factors such as population demographics, local health capacity and concentration of other vaccine providers were taken into consideration when planning for these clinics, officials said.

Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin have declined since their mid-November peak and have returned to levels seen over the summer.

Deaths from the virus are down from a December peak, but the seven-day death average has hovered in the teens for much of the past two weeks.

On Tuesday, the state reported 566 new cases and 33 additional deaths.

Ryan Westergaard, DHS chief medical officer, said the surge in cases over the fall helped strengthen strategies for contact tracing and testing, so when outbreaks appear, public health workers can more effectively stop the virus from spreading further.

15,food supply,Pandemic May Have Left 265 Million People With Acute Food Shortages in 2020,"Beyond the questions surrounding the availability, effectiveness and safety of a vaccine, the COVID-19 pandemic has led us to question where our food is coming from and whether we will have enough. According to a United Nations World Food Program (WFP) report, COVID-19 might have left up to 265 million people with acute food shortages in 2020. The combined effect of the pandemic as well as the emerging global recession “could, without large-scale coordinated action, disrupt the functioning of food systems,” which would “result in consequences for health and nutrition of a severity and scale unseen for more than half a century,” states another UN report.

In the United States, “food insecurity has doubled overall, and tripled among households with children” due to the pandemic, states a June 2020 report by the Institute for Policy Research (IPR) at Northwestern University, which relied on data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. In a recent interview with CBS News, IPR Director Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach warned that these statistics would likely “continue to hold,” with the numbers indicating particularly dramatic rises in food insecurity among Black and Latinx families. Indeed, families of color are being disproportionately impacted. According to an analysis of new Census data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), 22 percent of Black and 21 percent of Latinx respondents reported not having enough to eat, compared to just 9 percent of white people.

Globally, the effects of COVID-19 on food security are equally, if not more, severe. According to a CBS News report, WFP Director David Beasley told the UN Security Council in April 2020 that the world is on “the brink of a hunger pandemic.” He added, “In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in 10 of these countries we already have more than one million people per country who are on the verge of starvation.”

“The number of chronically hungry people increased by an estimated 130 million last year, to more than 800 million — about eight times the total number of COVID-19 cases to date,” wrote Mark Lowcock, the under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and Axel van Trotsenburg, managing director of operations at the World Bank. “Countries affected by conflict and climate change are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. Empty stomachs can stunt whole generations.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) warns that climate change “is likely to diminish continued progress on global food security through production disruptions that lead to local availability limitations and price increases, interrupted transport conduits, and diminished food safety.” The same might be said about the pandemic, which has made it abundantly clear: climate resilience, food security and global health are closely intertwined.

In terms of food security, another major concern is the pandemic-related school closures that have occurred across the globe, with UNICEF reporting that more than 1.6 billion children and young people have been affected. Schools provide a food lifeline for children; for so many, that is where they get their only nutritious meal of the day. In January, UNICEF and WFP released a new report that found that more than 39 billion in-school meals have been missed worldwide since the pandemic began, with 370 million children worldwide having missed 40 percent of in-school meals.

“The number of chronically hungry people increased by an estimated 130 million last year, to more than 800 million — about eight times the total number of COVID-19 cases to date.”

In early 2020, when COVID-19 was still a looming specter rather than the deadly virus we’re more familiar with today, the threat of food insecurity was a practical problem. Scenes of shoppers descending on aisles to stock up on supplies were a common sight. As CNN reported in March 2020, supermarkets around the world rationed food and other products, such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies, in an effort to curb stockpiling.

In Vermont, for instance, a steady increase in food insecurity since the start of the pandemic has correlated to employment levels, according to a survey conducted by the University of Vermont between March and April 2020. Approximately 45 percent of respondents “had either lost their jobs, been furloughed or had their hours reduced during the pandemic,” and a further two-thirds of survey participants who recorded scarcity of food in their households “had experienced job losses or work disruptions since the outbreak of the pandemic,” according to the survey. Vermont is just one example; the impact has been felt across the U.S. During the week before Thanksgiving last year, The Guardian reported that 5.6 million U.S. households “struggled to put enough food on the table,” while referring to the analysis of the Census data by CBPP.

As the pandemic continues to upend lives across the world, it has impacted the entire food supply chain. With factory and supermarket workers being highly susceptible to COVID-19, there’s been a concomitant decline in food production and a rise in prices. As Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reported, farmers in the U.S. were already facing labor shortages prior to the pandemic, and with tightened immigration as well as the heightened risk and poor compensation associated with these jobs, “food processors and farm labor contractors may struggle to find other workers willing to risk their lives to work in meat plants, packing sheds or produce fields.”

The pandemic has exposed the weakness of the industrialized global food system, which depends on long, complex transportation chains and cross-border travel. “[T]he monstrous and unsustainable food industry known as Big Ag … relies on the horrendous treatment of laborers, a wasteful allocation of resources, worldwide environmental devastation — and in a pinch, can quickly devolve into near-collapse of the entire system, as evidenced by the delays, shortages and pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the deepening hunger crisis in America,” April M. Short, a fellow at the Independent Media Institute, recently wrote in Salon. “Among the many necessary systemic changes, 2020 has illuminated the need to majorly restructure the way we cultivate and access food in our communities.”

It didn’t take the pandemic to reveal the inefficiency and injustice of our food system: globally, a third of all food is wasted, while nearly 690 million people were undernourished in 2019 — almost 60 million more people than in 2014. But the pandemic has underscored the matter: According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, “the number of acutely food insecure people could increase to 270 million due to COVID-19, representing an 82 percent increase compared to the number of acutely food insecure people pre-COVID-19.”

And the disruption of transportation has shown that the long distances it normally takes for food to get from one place to another can be a serious liability during a crisis. “[F]ood banks are under tremendous pressure to meet the skyrocketing demand,” wrote Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America CEO, and Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau, to then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in April of last year. “At the same time, however, we are seeing literally tons of agricultural goods being discarded because of the shutdown of so much of the economy.”

Consumer demand has shifted from eating out at restaurants and food services away from home, and food supply chain operations have had to be retooled. And that impact has been felt within the transportation sector. Forbes reported that Andrew Novakovic, an agricultural economist at Cornell University, “points to a number of weak spots in the food transportation system that could be aggravated by the increased demand for food.” A shortage of truck drivers is one potential weak spot, says Novakovic. Although he concedes there is debate on this matter, Novakovic maintains that “[t]rucking companies are finding it much harder to recruit [those] long haul drivers.” China, which was the first country to be hit by the virus, offers insight into the prolonged impact of the pandemic on transportation and food systems. The lockdown in the Hubei province of China, which is home to 66 million people, led to a shortage in delivery of animal feed as well as refrigerated containers full of imported vegetables, fruit and frozen meat in February 2020, according to an article in The Conversation.

In addition to shifting consumer demand, the pandemic has also made us take a closer look at where our food comes from and how it impacts not only the lives of food workers but also the lives of animals trapped in the food system. According to a new public opinion survey conducted by Lake Research Partners and commissioned by the animal rights group American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the vast majority — 89 percent — of Americans are “concerned about industrial animal agriculture, citing animal welfare, worker safety or public health risks as a concern.” The survey also found that “85 percent of farmers and their families support a complete ban on new industrial animal agriculture facilities — almost twice the level of support expressed by the general public.” This finding shows key support for the Farm System Reform Act, legislation that was introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) in 2019 that, among other reforms, seeks to put a moratorium on new or expanding factory farms.

Food insecurity has long been a pressing issue, particularly for developing countries. However, as Mir Ashrafun Nahar, a research associate at the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, explained in a Financial Express article, “the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more acute.” In response, Nahar argues for a policy-based approach that includes “subsidy based transportation systems for agriculture” to support supply chains, as well as policies aimed at cutting down on agricultural production costs in order to help farmers recover from the effects of the pandemic.

With the pandemic still affecting food supply, though, there are a number of logical measures for reducing the impact of the virus and maximizing output. “First, OSHA [the Occupational Safety and Health Administration] and the USDA must be directed to issue emergency standards that require employers to provide personal protective equipment, enough space to work without spreading the virus, and housing and transportation options that will reduce the spread of the virus,” wrote Faber.

The biggest risk for food security is not with food availability but with consumers’ access to food: safety nets are essential to avoid an increase in hunger and food insecurity.

Proposed in April 2020, Faber’s suggestions, unfortunately, remained unaddressed under the Trump administration. Faber’s relief measures further include the expansion of USDA programs to purchase surplus commodities to offset supply chain disruption; redirecting food that might be destroyed toward food banks, increasing the standard SNAP benefit (food stamps) by 15 percent; and echoing Nahar, Faber also proposes adopting policies that will help to alleviate financial burdens faced by farmers and food suppliers, as well as offering subsidy support.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic group with 37 member countries, said that the pandemic has “laid bare pre-existing gaps in social protection systems” in a report published in June 2020. “While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, experience so far shows the importance of an open and predictable international trade environment to ensure food can move to where it is needed,” the OECD report states. “The biggest risk for food security is not with food availability but with consumers’ access to food: safety nets are essential to avoid an increase in hunger and food insecurity.”

Another problem is the lack of media coverage about the food insecurity being witnessed around the world, particularly during the COVID era. As The Economist recently pointed out, journalists in 2020 “wrote more than 50,000 articles about the cancelled Eurovision song contest, but only around 2,000 about drought and hunger in Zambia.”

Fortunately, beyond the failings of a state-led response to the pandemic, some positives have emerged at a community level. With restaurants and supermarkets becoming less viable options, there has been a growth in demand and supply of local food. According to HuffPost, farmers have seen “a massive rise in demand for local produce.” The result of this trend is that consumers who are able to access local food are changing their behavior toward procurement and consumption of food permanently.

Things are changing on a federal level, too. In a recent article about how the U.S. food system could be transformed during the Biden administration, New York Times food correspondent Kim Severson noted that “[h]unger relief is a pressing issue” for Tom Vilsack, who is expected to the confirmed by the Senate to become the agriculture secretary in Biden’s cabinet, a job the former Iowa governor had in the Obama administration. However, while she notes that Vilsack (whose current job is running the U.S. Dairy Export Council, a dairy industry trade group) has his critics, especially among people in the organic farming world, President Biden has already made changes at the top, signing an executive order meant to deliver relief to families and businesses amid the COVID crisis, including “expanding and extending federal nutrition assistance programs” to “address the growing hunger crisis facing 29 million Americans.” His proposal to Congress includes a $3 billion package to “help women, infants and children get the food they need” and “access to nutritious food for millions of children missing meals due to school closures.”

For meaningful reform to the food system to occur, change is going to have to happen at every level: from federal, state and local governments, to Big Ag, small farmers and everyday consumers. With the future looking ever more uncertain due to the climate crisis — one of President Biden’s top priorities — adapting to new ways of producing and transporting food will be key to our survival.

18,food supply,"With Climate Change As First Priority, Temasek’s Initiatives Are In Line With Singapore’s Sustainability Plans","6 Mins Read

Singapore-based investment company Temasek recently announced that Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, currently the CEO of their commercial arm Temasek International, will succeed Ho Ching in her roles as Temasek CEO and executive director from October of this year, with Pillay emphasizing that climate change will be the main focus for the firm going forward. This is in line with Singapore’s several sustainability intiatives taken both, by governments as well as corporates.

Pillay, who is Indian, holds a Master of Law from the University of Cambridge and a Bachelor of Laws from the National University of Singapore. He was the former managing partner of law firm WongPartnership, bringing 20 years of legal experience to the new role along with being on the boards of the National Research Foundation and Enterprise Singapore, as well as an esteemed member of the National Jobs Council.

Joining Temasek back in 2010, Pillay was appointed CEO of Temasek International in 2019, where he presently manages its investment and portfolio activities.

Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng mentioned that in his new position, Pillay will oversee Temasek’s ‘stewardship role’, specifically in its constitutional responsibilities to safeguard its own past reserves as a Fifth Schedule entity.

During his briefing held at Temasek’s Dhoby Ghaut office, Pillay said that Temasek’s focus and biggest consideration is climate change. “In continuing our mission to generate long-term sustainable returns beyond our current generation, core to our success will be our commitment to build a better, more sustainable world. Leveraging our Temasek ecosystem and our global network of relationships, I am confident that we are in a good position to embrace the opportunities, and face the challenges, of today and the future. Our collective focus will be on doing right and doing good, even as we strive to do well, with conviction and purpose, as we continue to do things today with tomorrow clearly on our minds.”

This priority for climate change is in sync with Singapore’s focus as a whole given that in the past few years, Singapore has been making massive strides when it comes to food technology, setting up funds for food security and promoting a sustainable way of living through various pledges and initiatives.

Singapore – A Food Tech Hub

For instance, in December of last year, Eat Just, the pioneering food tech behind the plant-based JUST Egg, received approval from regulatory authorities in Singapore to use cultured chicken as an ingredient in chicken bites making this approval the world’s first-ever acceptance of cell-based meat for safe human consumption giving the alternative protein sector a huge push.

Adding to this, the San Francisco startup’s co-founder and CEO Josh Tetrick said that Singapore will ‘at minimum’ serve as its Asian headquarters and will continue to play an even bigger role in the future, revealing that the company is ‘considering’ housing its global manufacturing hub for its new cell-based meat line dubbed Good Meat in the city-state.

“Singapore for us will be at a minimum the base for Asia. And we’re considering Singapore as the hub for global manufacturing of what we call our brand’s Good Meat, [with] a facility or two in Western Europe and a facility or two in North America,” said Tetrick.

Apart from this, the Singapore government in its own capacity is launching funds and policies that will strengthen the country’s food security system.

For instance, in a recent announcement, the Singapore government will dedicate S$60 million (US$45.2 million) for a new agritech fund that will focus on supporting farmers through the use of technology that ultimately boosts domestic food production.

While explaining the country’s annual budget, Singapore’s finance minister Heng Swee Keat said: “The Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund is intended to ‘continue supporting technology adoption in the agrifood sector’, replacing the earlier Agriculture Productivity Fund that had been set up in 2014.”

In September last year, nine urban farms in the country were awarded close to S$40 million (US$29.3 million) under the government’s latest grant that is aimed at strengthening the city-state’s local food production and food security with most of these farms working on growing fresh vegetables and fruits using tech-forward solutions such as AI solutions.

Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment said: “While we continue to plan to tackle our long-term challenges, we also need to respond swiftly to the immediate global food supply challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Supporting our agri-food industry and augmenting their production capabilities remains a key strategy in strengthening Singapore’s food supply resilience.”

The grant is an addition to the city-state’s earlier S$100 billion (US$72 billion) plan to adapt to a climate-stricken future.

Singapore’s Green Plan 2030

Additionally, Singapore unveiled its Green Plan 2030 that showcases a range of 10-year sustainability goals such as planting 1 million trees across the city, a 30% reduction in per capita landfill waste, along with the creation of a ‘carbon services’ sector.

This plan is in line with the country’s commitments under the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, and other initiatives include requiring all new car models to use clean energy sources and to support this, more than double the targeted number of electric vehicle charging points will be installed by 2030.

The plan is also taking these initiatives to classrooms aiming for at least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral by 2030, with the rest of the schools to follow, in an effort to reduce two-thirds of net carbon emissions from the school sector.

Zero Waste Policy

In 2019, Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) announced that year as the ‘Year Towards Zero Waste’ with an effort to raise awareness about waste and kickstart habits like reducing, reusing, and recycling among the citizens.

With Singapore’s Semakau landfill predicted to run out of space by 2035, this plan outlined several ways that Singaporeans can reduce waste such as buying only what is necessary, recycling waste properly to avoid contamination, giving away excess food to those in need, and eliminating any single-use disposables.

And in just the first month of operation, the collection rate of bottles and cans increased more than 30 times along with supermarket chain FairPrice charging for plastic bags at 25 of its outlets.

A 2015 Accenture report predicted that the circular economy could unlock US$4.5 trillion of global economic growth, driven by uncertainty in the future supply of many natural resources and the fickleness of commodity prices.

Hence, Temasek too has developed plans for the next decade, with the company committing to halve its net carbon emissions by 2030.

“I think that if we do the right thing, things will turn out well for us, and by extension our stakeholders as well. We will build our capabilities in areas like AI, blockchain, digital, (digitalisation), cyber, and sustainability, all very important things, because they go to the health of the companies that we’re invested in, for long-term sustainable returns. That’s how we will approach it.”

Even in food tech innovation, Temasek has made massive investments for instance, it was one of the first funds globally to invest in Impossible Foods, a California-based company that makes plant-based burger patties that claim to taste like conventional meat. Just recently, it led a S$103 million (US$75 million) investment round, which is Temasek’s second investment in the food tech.

Recently, Temasek has been offering its support to encourage sustainable solutions for climate change such as the newly launched ‘Sustaintech Xcelerator‘ that includes partners like DBS and Google, and the platform aims to help those who are developing innovative tools to improve the monitoring and verification of environmental, social, and economic impacts of nature-based solutions (NbS).

It also extended its backing to Chinese food-tech venture capital Bits x Bites who recently raised US$30 million in the first close of its US$70 million fund investing in technologies that aim to transform China’s agri-food supply chain. And in July of last year, the Temasek Foundation awarded Singapore-based startup TurtleTree Labs S$1 million (US$718,800) after winning The Liveability Challenge 2020. The company will use the prize money to create a pilot product in Singapore and scale-up its biotechnology solution for slaughter-free lab-grown milk with full functionality from all mammals.
