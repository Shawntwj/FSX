“Our Shipper of Choice award recognizes a partner who strives for operational excellence,” said Matt Heroux, CEO of Fresh Freight. “The people of US Foods are some of the hardest working, and most respectful and skilled in food logistics. This is a relationships business, and we’re thankful for the partnership we have with US Foods. Their efforts have been critical to our success and together we can contribute to the betterment of our industry.”

The annual Fresh Freight Shipper of Choice award celebrates organizations that help advance higher performance standards for carriers and drivers. Some of the key elements of an award winner are communication, collaboration, and the development of opportunities for growth, respect for drivers, and a spirit of partnership.

For US Foods, Fresh Freight provides truckload service throughout the west coast for national account and broadline customers, including fresh, frozen, dry and multi-temp shipments.

Ernest Herrera, director of supply chain solutions at Fresh Freight, noted that US Foods personnel routinely put in long days and nights to achieve common goals, and their leadership team frequently reaches out to discuss projects and industry challenges. Their emphasis on reducing receiving dock time, for example, allows Fresh Freight to more effectively plan loads and optimize utilization.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, Herrera added, the two companies worked closely to manage very challenging load planning dynamics. “By March of 2020, eight weeks of our foodservice load inventory with US Foods had been changed or cancelled,” he related. “The US Foods team did a tremendous job of creating new opportunities through retail redistribution, inventory transfers, and engineering new vendor combinations to service their customers, and help keep our trucks running.”

Fresh Freight, as a premier partner to US Foods, also handles special projects. For example, when the US Foods distribution center in Houston was damaged by storms, Fresh Freight assisted with disaster relief efforts. In 2020, after US Foods acquired Food Services of America, Inc. (FSA), the carrier managed warehouse inventory transitions. In past years as well, it has supplied needed capacity by utilizing drivers to make customer direct deliveries in markets where operations were impacted by labor issues.

2,food supply,Working Like a Dog to Fill Pet Food Surge Orders,"Working Like a Dog to Fill Pet Food Surge Orders

Thanks in large part to the omnichannel logistics strategy that The Honest Kitchen and its long-time 3PL provider Saddle Creek Logistics Services implemented three years ago, the pet food company filled a record number of orders in the midst of a pandemic.

When significant growth at all-natural pet food company The Honest Kitchen compelled leadership to rethink its omnichannel logistics strategy three years ago, the company turned to long-time partner Saddle Creek Logistics Services for solutions.

More to the Story: Casebook Study: It's In The Doggy Bag

THE CUSTOMER

The Honest Kitchen, a manufacturer of minimally processed, human-grade, all-natural pet food, offers nearly 80 product options for dogs and cats. The company sources ingredients for its pet foods, toppers, treats, and supplements from the human food supply chain and manufactures in human grade-approved facilities.

THE PROVIDER

Saddle Creek Logistics Services is an asset-based, third-party logistics provider headquartered in Lakeland, Florida. It specializes in designing and delivering omnichannel logistics solutions for manufacturers, retailers, and e-commerce companies.

That was a fortuitous decision considering how COVID-19 upended the company's business in the second and third quarters of 2020. Working side by side to make daily decisions in a dynamic environment, the pet food company and its third-party logistics (3PL) provider filled a record number of orders safely by leveraging the flexibility of the system they had implemented earlier.

The Honest Kitchen has been nimble from its start in 2002, when founder and chief integrity officer Lucy Postins followed a hunch that nutrition could help her dog's health problems. Turns out she was right, so she began selling healthful, homemade people food for dogs from her San Diego, California, home under The Honest Kitchen brand.

During the next three years, staff doubled—to two—as the company added grain-free meals and treats, and received approval to use the term ""human grade"" on its products.

Today, with more than 50 employees, The Honest Kitchen offers nearly 80 options from five product lines for dogs and three product lines for cats. The company sources its ingredients for pet foods, toppers, treats, and supplements from the human food supply chain and manufactures in human grade-approved facilities. While it co-manufactures most of the products in the Midwest, the company recently opened a West Coast manufacturing operation to produce its Whole Food Clusters, a dry dog food line.

The company partnered with Saddle Creek back in 2006 when order volume grew to the point where Postins knew she couldn't keep filling orders from her kitchen. The logistics company assumed fulfillment in its San Diego facility.

The two nimble and entrepreneurial companies grew together. Today, Saddle Creek fills The Honest Kitchen's food orders from its larger Buena Park, California, and Joliet, Illinois, distribution centers.

Small But Mighty

As e-commerce has grown in recent years, so has The Honest Kitchen's business. While maintaining its commitment to small, independent pet stores, the company has grown through sales on Amazon and Chewy.com. It also offers direct-to-consumer sales on its branded website.

Jeff Jones, Saddle Creek's vice president of business development, wasn't surprised to see the pet food brand's sales take off online. ""Consumers are passionate about their pets. They'll feed their dogs before they feed their kids,"" he jokes.

In 2017, with double-digit year-over-year growth, The Honest Kitchen worked with the 3PL to devise a strategy that would allow Saddle Creek to optimize warehousing and fulfillment for omnichannel distribution. Jones' team managed the growth strategically, with an emphasis on pairing the brand's expanding profile with the most appropriate options among Saddle Creek's now 49 locations.

""Each facility has its own capabilities and personality, so we look to ensure a good mutual fit,"" Jones says.

And then came COVID

That strategy has worked. ""Through our partnership with Saddle Creek, we're able to facilitate best-in-class fulfillment that supports our growth,"" says Jake Fuller, chief financial officer at The Honest Kitchen.

The omnichannel expansion support was in place and on autopilot when COVID-19 hit in early March 2020. That's when all projections, business rules, and expectations went out the doggy door.

""In March, we saw a dramatic increase in order activity across all channels—from our online partners, but also from independent pet stores,"" says Fuller. ""We faced an unprecedented challenge: How do we fulfill and ship a great number of orders in the expected time frame to support our customers' needs and demands during a difficult period?""

""We saw record online orders as people stocked up during the early days of the pandemic,"" says Jones. ""There was also a lot of disruption with retail customers as volume migrated away from stores to e-commerce.""

The partners strategized frequently, making decisions in a constantly changing environment. For instance, the team continuously reprioritized orders to best meet customer needs across all channels.

Other changes included constantly shifting inventory levels across the 3PL's distribution centers and filling orders based on product availability and which facility had enough in stock to ship complete. The strategy wasn't optimal, but it worked.

Business decisions weren't limited to inventory levels and locations or how to prioritize orders, though. Saddle Creek had to keep staff safe, too.

""Many early conversations were about our facilities,"" Jones says. ""The safety of associates was our first priority.""

Concerned initially about staff level, the 3PL was able to maintain 95% associate attendance throughout the crisis. Without knowing what was to come initially, however, the company needed contingency plans in case there was an outbreak in any of its facilities, including the two serving The Honest Kitchen.

""We had to plan for events like trucks not being able to pick up orders,"" Jones says.

Adjusting to disruption

COVID-19-related changes at Saddle Creek facilities included reorganizing on the floor to increase distance between employees, staggering shifts and breaks, and providing staff with personal protection equipment. While there was always pressure to keep filling orders, facilities had to plan for regular deep-cleaning, too.

""We took a slight productivity hit early on, but we adjusted accordingly and quickly got back to our normal high degree of service,"" says Jones.

Joey Smits, director of inventory management and logistics at The Honest Kitchen, appreciates how Saddle Creek could bring in staff usually assigned to other clients as needed.

""Saddle Creek could be flexible and nimble because their staff is cross-trained across various clients that use systems that are similar to ours,"" Smits says. ""During unprecedented times, it was good to know that they had the option to go with the flow and support us.""

The partners acknowledged early on that the 3PL wouldn't always be able to meet service level agreements during the pandemic. When the original assumption is 1,000 orders per day and volume jumps to 5,000, something has to give. So, they put the focus on understanding the situation and discussing how to prioritize the workload when making decisions about specifics, such as whether to emphasize receiving inventory or processing outbound orders.

Because the pandemic didn't significantly disrupt the raw material supply chain or the co-manufacturing operation, the pet food company could replenish inventory and even introduce new products. What's more, in addition to meeting existing customer demand, the brand also acquired new customers from companies that struggled to fill orders.

Today, both companies are well positioned to weather any future pandemic-related shutdowns. With a stable situation now, they're returning to collaborating on various projects, including building variety packs for the pet food brand's new Pour Overs, Butcher Block Pates, and One Pot Stews.

For instance, the 5.5-ounce Pour Overs, known as ""toppers,"" are sold in cases of 12. When The Honest Kitchen began thinking about how to let customers sample the three different protein flavors before committing to a case, it discussed options with the 3PL. Saddle Creek now bundles the product into three-flavor variety packs for e-commerce.

""We started by telling Saddle Creek that we don't know how much product we need, and we don't know how well it will be received, but we need your help,"" says Fuller.

Saddle Creek assembled a small number of variety packs to start as the brand tested the idea. ""Now we kit thousands monthly,"" he adds.

The long-standing relationship and shared entrepreneurial spirit make these successes possible. While Jones notes that his company continues to look for ways to help The Honest Kitchen provide value to customers, Smits sees the 3PL as an important part of the pet food company's team.

""The Saddle Creek team is a natural extension of our business,"" says Smits.","Working Like a Dog to Fill Pet Food Surge OrdersThanks in large part to the omnichannel logistics strategy that The Honest Kitchen and its long-time 3PL provider Saddle Creek Logistics Services implemented three years ago, the pet food company filled a record number of orders in the midst of a pandemic.

3,food supply,"Fast food chain Subway warns it is facing shortage of 'carrots, eggs and cheese' because of Brexit","Branches of Subway, the sandwich chain, are facing shortages of fresh ingredients due to the 'impact of Brexit'.

Ingredients likely to be missing from sandwiches include carrots, eggs and cheese, with shops in Brentwood, Essex; St Helens, Merseyside; and Stoke-on-Trent all missing fillings, The Times reports.

A notice displayed on the doors of the shops listed above read: 'Due to the impact that Brexit is having on [the] supply of food, some of our fresh ingredients may not be available today.'

Branches of Subway, the sandwich chain, are facing shortages of fresh ingredients due to the 'impact of Brexit'

The sign was reportedly sent to all franchises by the chain's British headquarters ahead of the new year, in anticipation of delivery delays caused by Brexit bureaucracy.

One shop owner told The Times that they had been struggling to make sandwiches without carrots, eggs and cheese since Brexit at the start of the year, stating 'We can’t do anything on the breakfast menu.'

How delays at the border are hitting food deliveries There are more forms to fill in before lorries arrive at the Channel and other crossings following the UK's exit from the Customs Union and Single Market. And once they arrive at the ports, there are new checks by officials which also slow down the transport process. For UK retailers, it means there is a slowdown in receiving stock from the EU. It takes longer for European hauliers to get here, and UK-based lorries are slowed down on the way out and then slowed down on the return trip as well. This is leading to empty shelves and shortages of some goods for consumers. The most immediate problems are with perishable goods - food and drink. Alcoholic drinks and staples including broccoli, tomatoes and cheese have been in short supply because they are imported from manufacturers in Europe. The problems are similar for exporters, UK firms sending goods to be sold in Europe. The import problem is most acute for perishable foods. Fish and shellfish that are sold to European markets are decomposing in the back of lorries because of the time taken to get across. And now the problem is affecting other, more robust foods, like meat and vegetables, which are rotting on the dockside. Advertisement

Despite this Subway, which has a turnover of more than £7 billion and 43,000 outlets worldwide, said that the signs had been displayed in error and had asked staff to remove them, telling the publication they did not have any Brexit-related supply issues in the UK.

Subway uses IPC Europe, a company owned by Subway, to source ingredients from the continent.

As the Brexit transition ended on December 31 2020 McDonald's also warned of shortages on notices displayed in branches, before later claiming the signs were put up in error.

On the posters, distributed to restaurants as a contingency measure before the post-Brexit trade deal was agreed on Christmas Eve, McDonald's blamed 'supply challenges following Brexit' for lettuce and tomato that could be missing from its burgers.

The posters, spotted by Twitter users in various areas, said: 'Due to supply challenges following Brexit, some of our menu may be unavailable or have ingredients missing; eg lettuce, tomato. Please ask a member of staff for further details.'

McDonald's has since clarified with staff that the signs are not needed and sources say the chain is not anticipating any supply issues related to Brexit or otherwise.

The MailOnline has contacted Subway for comment.

Meanwhile smaller UK food companies have faced difficulties exporting to the EU, with one boss of a UK cheese producing company telling the BBC he was advised to set-up in Europe to avoid disruption to his EU exports.

The Department for International Trade told MailOnline it was 'not government policy' to advise businesses to set-up subsidiaries abroad.

However, co-founder of Macclesfield-based Cheshire Cheese Company, Simon Spurrell, was one of those who claimed he had been told to set up shop in the EU.

Mr Spurrell reportedly approached the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for advice over the need for a veterinary-approved health certificates for exports.

The firm was reportedly being asked to pay £180 for the certificates to export gift boxes costing up to £30 each.

A notice displayed on the doors of some UK Subway shops read: 'Due to the impact that Brexit is having on [the] supply of food, some of our fresh ingredients may not be available today.'

He told the BBC he had been advised to set up a packaging firm across the Channel.

Mr Spurrell said: 'They told me setting up a fulfilment centre in the EU where we could pack the boxes was my only solution.'

He added that the business was now looking to 'test the water' with a business in France, but it had scrapped plans to build a new £1million warehouse in the UK - which he said could have created up to 30 jobs.","Branches of Subway, the sandwich chain, are facing shortages of fresh ingredients due to the 'impact of Brexit'.

4,food supply,Protecting Aotearoa's food supply in wake of Covid-19,"Covid-19 created the biggest stress test of New Zealand’s food supply in generations.

The pandemic exposed weak points in our supply chain, with shortages of staple products such as flour and lettuce due to issues like panic buying and lack of packaging.

Nearly a quarter of Kiwis needed help feeding themselves and their families, many experiencing food insecurity for the first time after losing their jobs or taking pay cuts due to economic disruption.

Eketānhuna-based agriculture expert, and founder of the Agri-Women’s Development Trust, Lindy Nelson, said there were urgent lessons to be learned.

supplied Agribusiness expert Lindy Nelson says the pandemic showed the importance of securing our national food supply.

“Covid has been a wake-up call, but it’s nothing compared to the challenges we’ll face over the next 20-30 years with, for instance, extreme weather events and climate change,” she said.

The wake-up call

A cabinet document obtained by One News in August revealed the Government estimated the number of Kiwis struggling to afford food had doubled to 1 million over 2020.

At that point, the Ministry of Social Development was issuing more than 4000 emergency food grants a day.

Foodbanks around the country faced a massive increase in demand for food parcels, with the fallout of the pandemic continuing through Christmas – phone lines were jammed with tens of thousands of calls for help, and the lines outside a Christchurch foodbank caused traffic jams.

Joseph Johnson/Stuff Queues at the Christchurch City Mission got so long over the Christmas holidays they started causing traffic jams, as foodbanks across New Zealand faced a massive increase in demand for food parcels.

Nelson said building a more resilient food chain meant reconsidering our relationship with food.

“We must find solutions and new ways of being in the world, so that new structures evolve which meet the needs of our planet and its people,” she said.

One option, Nelson suggested, was further decentralising food distribution with more regional hubs and warehousing.

Nelson said community groups such as churches, local iwi or charities, could be supported in producing and distributing their own food, on a workshare or volunteer basis, to make sure everyone gets the basics.

Community gardens that sprung up in American cities such as Detroit in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis were an excellent example of that, she said.

Robyn Edie/Stuff KPMG global head of agribusiness Ian Proudfoot says the world will face Covid disruptions for years to come.

Ian Proudfoot, global head of agribusiness for consultancy firm KPMG, said the world would be dealing with Covid outbreaks and disruptions for years to come.

He said the pandemic should a catalyst for systematic change, with a first priority of making sure New Zealand can provide every Kiwi with good access to healthy, nutritious and culturally appropriate meals.

Proudfoot said part of the reason foodbanks and the Government struggled to cope during the pandemic was because there were already 500,000 Kiwis who required food assistance before 2020 began.

“[That’s] the immediate challenge we're facing, once people become food insecure, you don’t really see the numbers step back down without intervention,” he said.

Proudfoot said New Zealand was unique in that while it was a food producer, it also had some of the worst health outcomes of any developed nation.

He said many Kiwis were living with potentially fatal diseases such as obesity and diabetes not because of poor self-discipline or lack of thought, but because of a lack of good choices.

The worst-affected communities are not in remote locations, but often in the hearts of major cities.

“These New Zealanders are our neighbours, yet we as senior leaders are often blind to these deserts because we have the ability to make choices,” he said.

Proudfoot said conversations about food supply have tended to focus on producing enough food, and how to transport it.

But when flour disappeared from supermarket shelves it wasn’t because New Zealand ran out of flour – it was because suppliers ran out of packaging, and were scrambling to make enough to keep up with the spike in demand for 1 and 2kg bags of flour.

Proudfoot said piecemeal efforts were the problem.

“Work is being done by our health system, by iwi, hapū and other community groups, by our science sector, not-for-profits, NGOs and by individual growers and their suppliers... There are more than 30 government agencies that are involved in the food supply system.

“We’re having the right conversations [but] they’re siloed. We need to break down the barriers between different organisations [and issues] to look at the problem as a whole.”

Proudfoot said there’s long been a push to do that with a national food strategy, but after Covid-19 struck, the voices calling for one have increased exponentially.

He was involved in a resulting effort to develop such a strategy through The Aotearoa Circle, a partnership of government ministries and over 40 private organisations, including KPMG, Rabobank, Fonterra, the University of Auckland, Spark, Ravensdown and Contact Energy.

The road to a National Food Strategy

The Aotearoa Circle National Food Strategy project chairwoman Rangimare Hunia said a lot of key decisions were still to be made.

The project began in November, gathering evidence and looking at different organisational and economic models that could be applied to the national supply chain.

By the end of February the Circle aimed to create a fact pack, outlining the current state of New Zealand’s supply chain with key insights from other countries' food strategies.

The next phase will see the Circle draft a comprehensive national food strategy that will be delivered with a set of recommendations to government ministers and private sector partners.

The Government response so far

Ministry for Primary Industries assistant deputy director-general Ruth Fairhall said New Zealand had long enjoyed a net food surplus, thanks to a combination of natural resources and innovation.

This put the country in a relatively strong position to weather the pandemic’s disruption of national and international trade and supply chains, she said.

“The food industry was able to ensure the continued supply of food to New Zealanders, and continue exports to international markets for the large majority of our food products,” Fairhall said.

“Supply of shelf-stable and refrigerated goods was largely unaffected, with temporary exceptions such as flour in small packaging units.”

Fairhall said an intergovernmental group, led by the Ministry of Transport, was set up to keep tabs on the pandemic’s ongoing disruption around the world and to assess how the Government could help fix the supply chain issues that Covid-19 exposed.

The group included officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Primary Industries, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, and Customs.

“As part of this [the Government] is working to assist Ports of Auckland with work visas and immigration processes to fill the shortages of skilled labour at the port, which is a key pinch point,” Fairhall said.

“More broadly, the Ministry for Primary Industries works in many areas that support food security including improving sector productivity, ensuring the food we produce is safe, increasing sustainable resource use and protecting New Zealand from biological risks.”

As an immediate response to the Covid-19 disruptions, the Ministry of Social Development was also funnelling $32m of support to food banks, food rescue and other community organisations over the next two years through the Food Secure Communities scheme.

The scheme’s website said the funding would provide 21 million more meals a year to people in need, result in 6,200 tonnes less food going to landfill, and reduce carbon emissions by 2,238 tonnes.

“This will reduce pressure on New Zealand’s food supply chain and benefit the environment.

“Foodbanks and other organisations will be better placed to manage future shocks and provide greater food security for vulnerable New Zealanders.”

Looking to the future, the government’s Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change programme has funded research into how the agriculture and forestry sectors can mitigate or adapt to climate change since 2007.","Covid-19 created the biggest stress test of New Zealand’s food supply in generations.

5,food supply,Where's the beef: Meat lockers booked as pandemic derails food chain,"It’s all hands on deck behind the retail counter at Orly’s Meat Locker in Clarksville, where owner Troy Rinnels’ joins three staff members butchering a beef carcass on a recent Wednesday. Two other staff members are quickly packaging, weighing and labeling the cuts. The meat will be sold in no time.

“We’ve been fortunate to be busy. Since the pandemic we are extremely busy,” Rinnels said.

Slaughter operations like Orly’s are booming as many large meatpacking plants across the country were closed or drastically slowed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A soaring demand for beef and a crippled supply chain caused the traditional farm-to-fork cycle to derail.

Farmers and meat-lovers began to find alternatives, leaving meat lockers in Northeast Iowa and across the Midwest overwhelmed and forced to turn away farmers. Rinnels’ schedule is so full he can’t take new beef processing appointments until 2022.

Weakest link Last spring, large meatpacking facilities became hotspots for COVID-19. The virus took advantage of crowded work spaces and employees afraid of losing their jobs. It quickly ravaged workforces, shutting down plants and significantly slowing down others.

Two of the seven largest U.S. facilities — those with the capacity to process 5,000 beef cattle daily — were closed temporarily because of the pandemic, according to the Washington Post.

Iowa Premium plant in Tama, owned by National Beef Packing Co., suspended production for a week and had 177 out of more than 500 workers tested positive for coronavirus.

An order given on April 28 by former President Donald Trump classified meat processors as critical infrastructure and forced workers back to the production line.

By April, temporary plant closures and a hollowed out workforce reduced beef production by more than a third, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Production slowed, creating a bottleneck. Farmers still had a steady supply of animals ready for processing, but nowhere to go with them. Grocers were left with sparse — even bare — meat cases, forcing consumers on the hunt for beef to turn elsewhere.

Where’s the beef? Grocery stores like Hy-Vee and Fareway began to ration beef sales. On May 5, Wendy’s fast food chain had stopped serving beef hamburgers at about 20% of its 5,500 U.S. restaurants. Some Subway restaurants temporarily eliminated beef from their menu.

Management at SingleSpeed Brewing Co. in Waterloo reported their cost for beef also spiked.

Ground beef prices increased by 184% from May 2019 to May 2020, and beef eye round prices shot up 264%.

Upcharges for food with beef products are reported at other area restaurants.

“We didn’t have trouble getting it, but we also were making probably less than 40% of the amount of food we were making the year before,” said General Manager Ana Hanisch.

Customers’ demand for beef sent many straight to the source — farmers. Local farmers began to see double and triple sales of whole, half and quarter cows.

Crystal Blin, co-owner of JJB Cattle Co. in Independence, never thought she’d see a shortage of beef at the grocery store. This is, after all, Iowa.

“It was a supply chain issue, “she said. “There wasn’t a shortage of animals. ... The supply chain that had been built up over the last few decades was disrupted.”

The spike in direct-to-consumer beef sales prompted the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation in August to launch a farm-to-table webinar series to assist farmers.

Dan and Lynn Bolin, owners of New Day Dairy in Clarskville, signed up for the webinar after they began selling retired dairy cows to be processed as ground beef.

“We realized there was a need in our community,” Lynn Bolin said.

At first, the Bolins had no problem getting appointments at Orly’s meat locker to process the cows. In April, Lynn booked an appointment for three weeks away. By May, they discovered Orly’s was booked three months out. Today, the locker’s 2021 calendar is full and booking is a year out.

“I have the cow and I have the customer,” Lynn Bolin said, “but there’s an in-between piece that’s missing. There’s not a place that animal can be turned into something they can eat.”

The story is the same at the Elma Meat Locker. Owner Roger Meirick said the locker has been in the family since 1937, and he has never seen such high demand for local beef. Retail business doubled for several months last summer as customers were frantically buying beef and other meat in bulk. Sales spiked and have since leveled off, but are still about 50% higher than usual, he said.

Meirick added a handful of part-time staff to keep up with demand, noting, too, that processing has become more difficult as animals grew overweight while farmers waited for processing appointments.

“We were essential and people needed us,” Meirick said.

Back on the farm The Blins at JJB Cattle in Independence stopped waiting for meat lockers to catch up.

“That part of our business is just not going to happen this year,” Crystal Blin said of farm-to-consumer beef sales. “The demand is there, but we can’t get any spots.”

Because of the bottleneck, the Blins found themselves with extra calves that will likely be sold to a feed lot program. Those programs sell beef to grocery stores and restaurants.

“Whether you buy beef from us directly or you buy beef from the grocery store, you are still supporting farmers,” she said.

Supply chain leaders eye up the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to better predict demand, increase efficiency, cut costs, and power growth.

Robert Bosch LLC, more commonly known as Bosch, operates more than 270 manufacturing plants and thousands of manufacturing lines to produce millions of products. These include mobility solutions, consumer goods, and energy and building technology. Bosch management has set a goal of ensuring that, by 2025, all its products will either contain artificial intelligence (AI) or have been developed with the aid of AI.

Among other applications, Bosch is currently using AI to improve quality, plant logistics and efficiency, and to reduce costs. ""Our use of AI is widespread,"" says Rahul Kapoor, vice president and global head of AI, Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence.

For instance, Bosch is using AI to improve intraplant logistics, or ""milk runs,"" in which materials move from warehouses to production lines to support just-in-time manufacturing. Previously, the materials were shuttled at fixed times on fixed routes.

While that worked well, the schedules created with AI help manage demand changes and introduce flexibility. ""The solution is helpful to optimize and dynamically adjust routes, so we only deliver and pick up material where it's truly needed,"" says Andy Hassold, connected industry consultant with Bosch Rexroth, a subsidiary of Bosch.

Bosch also combines a manually developed sales and demand forecast with one produced using machine learning (ML). ""We've seen improvement by combining the methods,"" Kapoor says.

Supply chain professionals across numerous verticals are implementing technology solutions that incorporate AI and its subset ML, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). While the pandemic may have slowed investments, it hasn't stopped them. About two-thirds of organizations responding to a recent Gartner survey either didn't change or increased their planned AI investments since the onset of the pandemic (see sidebar, page 170).

In another survey, IDC found that growth in spending on IoT slowed in 2020, but was still up 8.2%. IDC predicts a return to double-digit growth in 2021.

Driving Growth

What's behind the sustained investments? ""It's a combination of AI, IoT, and ML, now turbocharged by 5G, that is revolutionizing supply chains,"" says Warren Chaisatien, global director of IoT customer success marketing with Ericsson, a Swedish networking and telecommunications company. Among other capabilities, the technologies can analyze data, including real-time sales and customer preferences, to better predict demand. In warehousing, AI-powered visual inspection can identify and correct damage before products are shipped out.

Among the verticals implementing these technologies are retail, manufacturing, and food production. One common thread across these supply chains: ""They're no longer linear,"" says Drew Ehlers, global futurist and general manager of SmartPack, aload planning solution from Zebra Technologies.

These networks replace supply chains, and distribution centers, warehouses, manufacturing plants, and retail stores all become fulfillment nodes. ""Fulfillment happens dynamically across the network,"" Ehlers adds.

Ensuring Food Safety

In food production and distribution, these technologies can ensure safety and quality. Schwan's Home Delivery, a leading direct-to-home food delivery company, operates 300-plus depots and more than 3,000 trucks, all of which need to be kept at specific temperatures—well into negative numbers—to ensure food safety and quality. Until recently, employees manually checked and recorded the temperatures, including after hours and on weekends.

No more. Schwan's is implementing wireless sensors within the trucks and freezers that continually monitor temperatures and transmit the findings to both drivers and management. ""I can see the freezer temperatures on all trucks at a glance,"" says Larry Gaskin, national director of warehouse operations. ""It provides a level of confidence.""

As of mid-October 2020, about one-third of Schwan's trucks and depots had been outfitted with the SmartSense solution from Digi International, a provider of IoT technology.

Installing the sensors is easy enough that each depot can do it themselves. And when the company retires a truck, it can simply take out the existing equipment and move it to another truck. ""It's easy to install and follow up on,"" Gaskin adds.

AI can also help food producers and retailers quickly establish the provenance of an item, says Rob Bailey, chief executive officer and founder of BackboneAI, a data automation company. Using AI, data on the farm where a piece of produce was grown can be mapped to the destination data at the retailer, and then probabilistically identify the source of items that might be contaminated—all within minutes. Historically, this process has taken weeks.

These technologies may even improve the global food supply chain. In 2019, IBM and Yara, a crop nutrition company, partnered with the goal of increasing food production on existing farmland by applying AI, ML, and big data within a global digital farming platform. This platform will integrate with IBM Food Trust, a blockchain-enabled network of food chain players. Ultimately, the new platform will enable ""greater traceability and supply chain efficiency,"" the companies say.

Retail and CPG BENEFITS

While the pandemic has hammered many brick-and-mortar stores, it also accelerated the shift to online shopping. That's prompting many retailers to invest in AI for several reasons, including to improve inventory and supply chain management and better predict demand, according to Meticulous Research.

For instance, AI can assemble and analyze data from point-of-sale and inventory systems and identify patterns. Then, it would let a retailer know that instead of the dozen cases of Coke it typically sells in one shift, it only sold six, for example.

With this information, users can determine what's behind the change and take action, including adjusting their supply chains.

Similarly, consumer product companies can deploy AI to read demand and then adjust their supply chains to optimize what they sell to each retailer, says Dinand Tinholt, vice president of insights and data for consulting firm Capgemini North America. AI can also help them repurpose machines to reflect changes in demand.

Retailers and CPG firms can also use AI to personalize products. Nike Fit, for instance, uses a mix of technologies, including data science, ML, and AI, to collect more than one dozen data points from customers' feet. It can then recommend the shoe size likely to best fit them.

Not only does this improve customer service, but it can also reduce returns. The top reason for online returns in 2019 was incorrect size, fit, or color, found ""The State of Online Returns,"" a Narvar report.

Manufacturing Revolution?

Like Bosch, many manufacturers are using, or are interested in using, AI and IoT to improve production and distribution. ""We've seen an acceleration of digitization,"" says Rohit Gupta, chief executive officer and co-founder of Auditoria.AI.

Some manufacturers are connecting machines and equipment with IoT and then applying AI to more precisely schedule maintenance. ""In the old days, you'd just run a machine until it broke down,"" says Alan Salton, director of innovation with Panorama Consulting Group.

Or, a plant manager might set rather arbitrary maintenance schedules—say, performing maintenance after 300 runs—whether or not it was needed. By alerting management to upcoming maintenance needs based on a machine's operation, AI can reduce machine downtime and minimize scheduling disruptions.

As Bosch is doing, manufacturers can deploy AI for demand and supply planning. With AI, they can more accurately determine what and when to order from vendors, and whether they should, for instance, move products from Illinois to Arizona to capitalize on a demand uptick there.

The potential from combining IoT, 5G, AI, and ML within manufacturing will likely lead to ""a renaissance of innovation in the entire manufacturing space in the coming year,"" Tinholt says.

American AgCredit (AAC) has pledged $2 million to support GoFarm Hawai‘i, one of the largest and most successful beginning farmer development programs in the nation. The University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) program provides business technical assistance, educational opportunities and access to a suite of resources designed to remove barriers to farming and agribusinesses. It also operates five beginning farmer training sites across four islands and an agricultural technician training program at the Waiawa Correctional Facility.

“Food sustainability and economic diversification are key post-pandemic priorities for our state,” UH President David Lassner said. “Many of the GoFarm Hawai‘i program’s alumni have started independent businesses or secured jobs in the agricultural industry. This strategic philanthropic investment from AAC provides a major boost to our state’s next generation of farmers and our agricultural community statewide.”

The Hawai‘i 2050 Sustainability Plan has a goal of doubling local food production by 2030.

“Hawai‘i imports about 85–90% of its food, making it particularly vulnerable to disruptions in food supply,” said CTAHR Dean Nicholas Comerford. “Our GoFarm Hawai‘i program addresses this by providing farmers with the tools they need to be successful, and expanding our local food supply—a necessity for our entire community.”

National donors

The donation represents the combined contributions of AAC and CoBank, both members of the nationwide Farm Credit System.

“Everyone in American agriculture understands the need to grow and develop the next generation of farmers and ranchers,” added Bill Davis, executive vice president of CoBank’s Farm Credit Banking Group. “It is absolutely critical for the industry and for the country as a whole. But for those who don’t come from a farming background, it can be difficult to get started. GoFarm Hawai’i has a proven and successful model for engaging beginning farmers and, together with our partners at AAC, we are delighted to be a part of their continued success.”

Diverse local support

GoFarm Hawai‘i Director Janel Yamamoto added, “We are extremely grateful for American AgCredit and CoBank’s support of our practical training program built around the real-world needs of tomorrow’s farmers. With their support, and the support of other key partners, we can help experienced farmers looking to expand and needing assistance to develop a business plan or proposal, as well as people new to agriculture, wanting to learn the basics of farming.”

The GoFarm Hawai‘i program is financially supported by competitive grants and private donations. Kamehameha Schools, the Ulupono Initiative, USDA NIFA and the Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture have been strong supporters of the program since its inception.

Many additional organizations provide access to financial support, land, facilities, contribute labor/time, resources and expertise to support program participants. Program supporters and collaborators include: Kaua‘i Community College; UH Maui College; Corteva Agriscience; CTAHR Cooperative Extension, Hi!Ag Consortium; UH Sea Grant; The Kohala Center; Hawai‘i Department of Labor and Industrial Relations; Hawai‘i Department of Public Safety; City and County of Honolulu; County of Hawai‘i; Kaua‘i County Office of Economic Development; Farm Service Agency; Natural Resource Conservation Service; Hawai‘i Tourism Authority; O‘ahu Resource Conservation & Development Council; North Shore Economic Vitality Partnership; Farm Link Hawai‘i; Agricultural Leadership Foundation of Hawai‘i; Ho‘ola Veteran Services; Sustainable Moloka‘i; and the Hawai‘i Agritourism Association.

Michelle Galimba added, “As a shareholder in AAC and past board member of Farm Credit Service of Hawai‘i, I could not be more thrilled with this significant investment in GoFarm Hawai‘i. Growing new farmers and ranchers and helping existing farmers and ranchers increase their business skills will increase the resilience and sustainability of the state of Hawai‘i for decades to come.”

2021: The Year of Analytics-Driven Logistics

The effect of COVID-19 on supply chain efficiency has been profound. As the demand for critical products, components, and raw materials surged, the ripple effects transformed the industry. Supply chain stakeholders must now identify, package, and deliver shipments faster, while also finding new ways to reduce cost and improve performance.

At the same time, the volume and variety of relevant data sources have grown by leaps and bounds. IoT, telematics, autonomous vehicles, and machine-to-machine communications, along with traditional systems, are creating data at an unprecedented rate. This has fostered the emergence of new analytics and artificial intelligence tools that have helped logistics professionals understand and respond to the avalanche of data.

Amid all this information, the challenge for logistics professionals is to find the needle of data in the haystack. Without faster analytics, as well as a way to separate critical data from background noise, it's impossible to find the anomalies and critical connections at the speed that modern business demands.

Fortunately, new forms of accelerated data analytics are available to solve the problem. These analytics platforms not only allow interrogation of billions of rows of data at the speed of human curiosity, but can be accessed via the cloud to reduce adoption cost.

Of particular relevance to logistics problems is the ability to get location intelligence from data. Advanced geospatial analytics make it possible to continually track trucks, ships, trains, and other modes of transport, as well as connect data from one mode to another. They also make it possible to cross-reference external datasets to integrate traffic, weather, safety, and emergency information in real time.

—Todd Mostak, CEO & Co-Founder, OmniSci

""Although we expect a choppy economic recovery, the logistics sector should persevere with strong demand as we see the recovery accelerate following vaccine deployment cycles. With businesses expecting to rebound and labor markets improving, the logistics sector will be the nucleus of the global economic rebuilding endeavor.""

Food Sector Serves Up Success Story

The most successful pivot and biggest resilience story in the U.S. supply chain during COVID-19 is in the food sector.

In the spring of 2020 there was an unprecedented pivot in manufacturing, distribution, and retail from the restaurant to the grocery retail endpoints. (The air transport industry is another major success story.) Depending on whether a company primarily serviced the restaurant or grocery sectors, it either had to absorb 90%+ declines or 100%+ increases in volume in the span of a month, then pivot to realign customers with suppliers, including renegotiating freight and contracts.

In the fresh produce picking and meat processing operations, adversity was even greater due to the compounding effects of outbreaks among workers and health-related shutdowns. Despite this, we have seen relatively few food sector bankruptcies (yet) and people have been fed, with relatively little increase in cost or availability to the consumer.

The lesson learned here is that the tremendous diversity of suppliers, distributors, and retailers, along with the freedom of the private sector to rapidly shift its operations without much red tape, and the largely self-sufficient nature of the U.S. food supply, are major resilience assets.

These systemic strengths contributed to an amazingly resilient food system in the spring of 2020. This is a huge success story, and the people who made it happen deserve so much credit. We should also be on guard against private or public actions in coming years that could compromise the resilience the system has already demonstrated.

At the same time, we have been reminded of the pitfalls of just-in-time approaches. Buffers, inventories, and reserves are a valuable hedge against risk and shock to supply chains, and we should carefully consider where in the supply chain we need to accept the cost of carrying increased inventories and stockpiles—and who should pay for that.

Failure to adequately protect worker health and safety—especially in this case farm and food worker health—has shown itself to be a major threat to our national food security, and this also needs focused attention and improvement from both private and public players. While there are some lessons to learn from this hard year, we should not lose sight of the main lesson: Our food system and the people who run it have proven extremely effective and resilient under the stress.

Three Must-Haves for a Post-COVID Comeback

COVID-accelerated e-commerce presents considerable challenges for supply chain operations. With door-step delivery, buy-online-pickup-in-store, curbside pickup, and traditional retail store fulfillment, logistics managers must consider how to stock for multiple delivery points. While increasing safety stock levels is one solution to avoid out-of-stocks, it can erode profits. Retailers should focus on the following:

1. Boost inventory transparency. To keep up with e-commerce growth, retailers need to know where an item is throughout the supply chain at any time. With RFID technology, they can run stock queries based on real-time item visibility and accurate item counts.

Using radio transmission, as opposed to barcode line of sight, RFID sensors gather individual data from multiple items that may be packed inside boxes. The ability to read individual item signatures in milliseconds reduces errors in the count and enables the system to produce real-time stock queries by location.

2. Get help from artificial intelligence. AI plays a crucial role in supply chain management, taking over the heavy lifting and repetitive tasks that are often done manually. AI can offer recommendations on how and what can be improved to boost supply chain speed and efficiency, while also considering cost-effectiveness.

AI can be linked to RFID data and automatically create orders for stock replenishment. RFID compares the on-shelf items to the store merchandising plan. AI can display alerts for missing items and identify what needs to be replaced, down to color, size, and count. By integrating AI into the supply chain, businesses can better plan for demand peaks and improve performance.

3. Improve 5G reliability. Getting a reliable WiFi connection in a warehouse can be challenging. 5G provides high bandwidth and low latency features, offering a unified platform for multiple device connectivity. Not only is it 1,000 times faster than 4G, it can also handle 10,000 times more traffic. This enables employees to track the global movement of goods in real time, while significantly increasing speed and productivity.

—Philip Calderbank RFID Consultant, BSN

Re-Imagining Warehouse Logistics Amid Global Disruption

With online sales surging, the demand for warehouse space is exponentially increasing as organizations look for larger fulfillment centers to store their products. This shift has significantly impacted the real estate market, as e-commerce retailers demand three times more physical space than brick-and-mortar stores.

These pandemic-spurred changes have forced organizations to rethink how they approach using warehouse space.

A CONVOLUTED ECONOMIC CLIMATE

The current economic climate forces organizations to reconsider their investment in all the spaces of their business, and warehouse space must be a key consideration.

With increased uncertainty around supply chains, forecasting appropriate inventory levels and corresponding warehouse needs has quickly become both more complex and business-critical. Using the right advanced technology can lend a hand to organizations seeking assistance in re-imagining warehouse logistics.

TECHNOLOGY IN THE WAREHOUSE SPACE

To navigate the unpredictability we currently face, organizations need tools that not only take a more in-depth look across historical data in the entire supply and demand ecosystem, but also help with evaluating the complex ""what-if"" scenarios. Leveraging technology, supply chain decision-makers can gain greater insights on how to optimize warehouse space.

Automation. Deploying automation capabilities allows organizations to rapidly scale up or down, dependent on buyer demand, providing warehouses with greater flexibility to accommodate an influx of products.

Internet of Things (IoT). Inventory management in warehouses has dramatically improved with the use of IoT devices to track and analyze the movement of goods in real time—allowing for greater visibility into how much warehouse space is needed to store products.

Machine learning and AI. Artificial intelligence has improved forecasting and planning for manufacturers as they navigate unique buyer behavior related to the pandemic. With accurate forecasting abilities, supply chain speed and accuracy improve, and organizations can be more cost-efficient when looking at other manufacturing logistics.

SCALING TO DEMAND

By deploying these technologies, organizations can make more informed warehousing decisions by gaining a holistic view of cyclical sale patterns—along with how these have changed over the past six months. This allows them to better understand where to build up inventory or scale down, as well as provides greater visibility into inventory levels and upcoming product expiration dates.

With this information, senior leaders can make assessments that more accurately project a company's future warehousing needs within today's changing world, and help avoid any knee-jerk reactions that may hold back future ambitions.

—Mike Edgett, Product Marketing Director, Sage

Microfulfillment is Here to Stay

Companies like Walmart and Target have deployed microfulfillment centers by bringing the warehouse to the consumer and optimizing contactless pickup.

More businesses are adopting this system, implementing fully automated contactless customer pickup logistics systems that work with shippers to provide pickup optimization for big and bulky goods such as building supplies and appliances, to integrate a safe and seamless customer pickup experience at warehouse and store locations.

The pandemic has reinforced the importance of customer experience and rewarded creative ways to ensure needs are met, even when they change rapidly. We'll see this new strategy implemented for years to come.

Build Stronger Relationships and Acquire Better Data

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked economic unpredictability and volatility. U.S. freight capacity suddenly increased alongside shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. Then, capacity tightened again as industries such as automotive rebounded and consumer demand for certain products rose.

The misalignment between freight and carrier capacity pushed shippers into the spot market more than we normally see, and brokerage became a more central method for moving goods.

Reliance on brokers and the spot market remains high, but maintaining this trend over time will continue to cost shippers millions. With variable rates running 30 cents per mile higher than contracted rates, costs add up quickly across billions of annual freight movements.

Brokerage is helpful on volatile shipments and under tight deadlines, but using their services conceals underlying data that could benefit shippers and carriers.

Without direct access to who is moving freight, and when, it's impossible to recognize when patterns emerge. This is especially true when brokerage matches freight with small- and mid-sized carriers that are an ideal network fit, but typically fly under the radar for shippers in their RFP.

Two key recovery strategies for shippers are to rebuild carrier networks with flexibility and to broaden their access to a wider transportation dataset.

1. Diversify your carrier network for improved agility. Rather than using brokerage or the spot market as a long-term solution, shippers should identify smaller carriers that fill gaps in their routing guide. Shippers can refocus network strategies around contracted freight and pursue direct relationships with carriers, then actively monitor and amend those agreements.

This avoids unnecessarily paying brokers for connecting carriers with freight, so they stand to make more money. It's also ideal for shippers because they avoid brokerage premiums while gaining transparency into how freight is being moved. This creates much stronger partnerships.

There will always be times when turning to the spot market and relying on trustworthy brokers is necessary, but a balanced carrier portfolio gives shippers flexibility.

2. Get insight from data outside your network. Another limiting factor is shippers' limited access to data from only their own transportation networks. This provides an incomplete picture of what's happening across the wider industry.

When you make procurement decisions based only on your own network, it's easy to lose sight of the variability that is created by your peers, third parties, and thousands of carriers. What you see in your own data may or may not be reflective of reality.

In uncertain times, looking at the freight movements happening around you informs better decision making by clarifying what is happening now and what could happen next in the freight market.

COVID-19 Redefines Supply Chain Partnerships

While we have experienced observable changes like e-commerce acceleration, we've also seen some less obvious shifts following COVID-19. Mainly, there is now an increased emphasis on companies looking to their transportation and distribution providers to create value that transcends traditional cost-based decision making.

VALUE CREATION

Performance will surpass cost as the number one factor in maintaining successful relationships with logistics providers. Labor shortages and a shift toward quality and stability will result in a reevaluation of lean supply chains.

The extreme disruptions experienced in 2020 will shift C-level perception of their supply chain functions from cost centers to value creators. With organizations willing to pay for quality service and reliable capacity, shippers will increasingly demand flexible solutions from providers.

Data and solutions design capabilities will play an increasingly important role in differentiating the financially healthy and growing carriers/3PLs from the rest of the pack. Providers will accelerate sustainability initiatives as shippers look to partner with organizations that value and focus on people and the environment.

Shippers will increasingly contract with providers that offer a partnership approach vs. the more traditional procurement sourcing model of price-driven RFPs.

Logistics organizations that foster trusting relationships by offering innovative solutions, non-biased feedback, and excellent operational performance will thrive.

To someone outside our industry, these ideas make common sense, but for years shippers and non-asset 3PLs have focused their efforts primarily on reducing costs in traditionally siloed transportation and operations functions, often at the expense of stability and resilience.

COVID-19 caused triggering cracks to form in what executives assumed were strong transportation and distribution networks.

Going forward, we will experience greater collaboration between shippers and carriers, with providers that offer solution design expertise uncovering cost savings opportunities, while also helping organizations build more resilient networks to protect supply chains from future disruptions.

These partnerships will become more prevalent between shippers and asset-based providers, as asset-based carriers back up their design solutions with contractual commitments and capital investment, and as a result have more skin in the game.

CULTURE SHIFT

2020 was a challenging year for the supply chain. However, through all the challenges, a culture of true partnership is emerging. Shippers are moving beyond simply looking at the cheapest option when choosing a transportation and logistics partner, and instead, are focused on finding true partners they can rely on for increased stability and resiliency. By forming these deeper partnerships, carriers and shippers are able to collaborate and critically examine operations to find places to reduce costs across the board.

—Frank Granieri, COO, Supply Chain Solutions, A. Duie Pyle

""COVID exposed an imbalance in the relationship between buyers and suppliers. As buyers focus on building resilience to future shocks, we need to consider how best to equip suppliers to come with them on that journey. Technology can help to address this challenge, unlocking faster, more predictable cash flow, better access for diverse suppliers, and increased optionality in the event of disruption. What's good for suppliers is good for buyers.""

—Christian Lanng, CEO, Tradeshift

Strengthening Supply Chains for Temperature-Controlled Vaccine Distribution

During the height of pandemic disruptions, most supply chains bent, but they did not break. Planning, collaboration, and flexibility proved paramount. Supply chain and logistics experts are using the additional knowledge gained over the past year to help ensure safe, efficient delivery of vaccines.

One big hurdle is the vaccine's temperature-control requirements, which can be especially challenging for four reasons:

1. Transport, packaging, and facilities need to be temperature-controlled and monitored, and stability data regarding effective temperature ranges need to be followed.

2. There are limits to the amount of dry ice allowed on aircraft and potential re-icing during transport requires specific accoutrements/apparel and safety protocols.

3. Last-mile efforts are vital to ensure vaccine delivery and replenishment for a network of vaccination sites, including remote locations.

4. These facilities are highly regulated. They cannot be built just anywhere at any time. They have to be licensed, inspected, and adhere to specific standards and regulations. This can take time.

Fortunately, these are not insurmountable challenges. For instance, one vaccine manufacturer developed specialized packaging to hold dry ice. It also opted for a more direct distribution model—mainly using express carriers—to minimize any risk that temperatures are compromised in transit.

As for other models, such as delivering vaccines to warehouses where they are broken down and delivered to the point of care, manufacturers will rely on partners like 3PLs that have specialized capabilities and capacity—or the ability to add it at short notice. In developed markets, there is generally sufficient capacity in place. Certain 3PLs can supplement capacity with additional certified cold chain capacity quickly as vaccines come online.

With regard to last-mile delivery, the networks of the integrators will play a crucial role, particularly in emerging markets. There is also an important role to be played by 3PLs, as they support allocation and capacity planning, scheduling, routing, monitoring, and exceptions management.

Thanks to new visibility tools and increased data exchange with pharmaceutical companies that emerged during the pandemic, 3PLs are able to track shipments and take action to ensure on-time, secure delivery like never before. It is a great example of how management of data flows in logistics can be just as important as physically enabling the flow of the product.

The amount of activity, cooperation, and coordination occurring is historic. Many supply chain and logistics leaders are focused on helping get vaccines into the hands of healthcare professionals as soon and effectively as possible. It is a great opportunity for our entire industry to step up and demonstrate the value we deliver—usually behind the scenes—for our customers and society at large.

Three Trends in the New Normal

1. The concept of ""peak"" may no longer be tied solely to the holiday season. COVID-19 brought record-breaking, peak-level demands to retailers at various points throughout 2020, forcing their warehouses to be prepared for any and everything and questioning the idea of a single peak season.

While holidays will always remain one of the busiest times for retailers, it's likely we'll begin seeing more demand-generation events throughout the year to bring in profit that has previously only been attainable during the final months of the year.

2. ""Concierge"" fulfillment will begin to emerge over the next several years. The pandemic increased consumer interest in e-commerce, BOPIS, and BOPAC, changing the way retailers think about their commerce strategies. Retailers can no longer just focus on improving one of those forms of fulfillment, but must look at all of them (in addition to in-person fulfillment) to create a cohesive strategy in which customers experience the same level of service, regardless of the way they shop.

Once this strategy is executed successfully through proper supply chain and warehouse tracking, retailers can begin looking toward more ""concierge"" fulfillment efforts like deliver-to-trunk or deliver-to-garage strategies.

3. We will see a greater democratization of fulfillment. Consumer demand during the pandemic gave independent 3PLs and fulfillment centers the ability to step up and prove themselves as viable options. Retailers are turning to other fulfillment networks to deliver on fast fulfillment because industry leaders failed them.

We will continue to see more vendors working together to create access to flexible, affordable fulfillment automation solutions that empower brands of all sizes to more easily scale operations and meet customer expectations, without an outsized price tag.

Collaborating with Competitors: Grocery sector has it in the bag

Grocery stores worked swiftly to address the challenges brought on by COVID restrictions, adjusting their approach to managing inventory, stocking shelves, and servicing customers.

Working to balance the uncertainty of the supply with the increase in demand, grocery stores re-examined their lean supply chain strategy. Across the board, they promptly worked with their logistics partners to implement a collaborative effort, aligning supply strategies with demand requirements.

As the direct point of contact for the consumer, grocery stores took a leadership position in collaborating with supply chain stakeholders to ensure high-demand items were at the right place at the right time. This cooperative effort was a carefully orchestrated symphony of moving parts from manufacturing, to delivery, to placing the goods on the shelves.

In addition to working in tandem with the supply chain community, grocery stores worked with their local communities to create a safe shopping experience. Many stores implemented one-way shopping aisles, sanitizing protocols, and plexi-glass barriers, and allowed a reduced number of people in the store. They also introduced or enhanced the option of online ordering and curbside, contactless pickup.

One key takeaway for the industry is that we need to build supply chains as well as business models that are designed to be agile and flexible, bending as the challenges and opportunities present themselves.

The grocery store sector's ability and openness to working cooperatively with its supply chain partners should be considered one of the greatest examples of collaboration between manufacturers, motor carriers, and retailers, which will have both short-term and long-term impact on all parties. We, as an industry, need to work toward building a stronger supply chain, comprised of collaborative partnerships.

The value of the concept of collaborating with competitors in the name of supply chain fluidity was brought to life by the grocery store sector and its logistics partners.

Prioritize Supply Chain Strategy to Control Costs

Post-pandemic planning requires you to assess potential risks that exist and plan alternative ways to respond to evolving demands. Proper contingency planning today positions you for growth tomorrow. Consider these tips to maintain customer service levels while controlling costs.

Be prepared to adjust. Even in typical years, budget planning requires some guesswork. As consumer behaviors and disruptions rapidly evolve, the forecasting game has become significantly more challenging. Since costs can be a moving target, scarce resources and funds must consistently flow to the most valuable business outcomes.

Use supply chain resources. Determining the corporate impact of plans produced by other organizational departments reveals the levers that affect cost and service. Third-party logistics providers possess analytical capabilities to construct a global picture of the organization's total business from a data perspective.

Always be a partner. When a supply chain succeeds, all those involved will succeed. A supply chain partner with a continuous improvement mindset will uncover ongoing opportunities across your network. This added visibility allows you to be a better partner to your domestic and foreign vendors. With the right knowledge, you can accurately and openly communicate sales information, time-in-transit data, and other key performance indicators. Enhanced transparency fosters better relationships.

Evaluate and modify. Aggressively evaluate your entire supply chain and take an open-minded approach to the long-term structure. Does your supply chain strategy align with your corporate strategy? Are you leveraging analytical tools and supply chain expertise to monitor your strategy? Maybe you are getting your products out the door, but are you making money? Constant evaluation and adjustment are key.

Look internally. Examine internal processes and systems. Balancing resiliency and efficiency, supply chain leaders will secure their networks. The past year reminded us of the importance of agility. You must be ready to shift rapidly, yet balance service and cost to protect profitability.

How to Overcome Hurdles and Build Resiliency

Future-looking supply chains need to combine digitization, optimization, and diversification to incorporate the level of resilience necessary now and into the future. Here are key strategies to build greater resilience into the supply chain:

Diversify your supply. Now is the time to re-evaluate supply chain geographies and look to diversify supply. This means a combination of international and domestic sourcing options. According to McKinsey, this trend started pre-COVID, but not as a means to mitigate risk. Instead, it improved speed to end consumers, which is a critical value proposition. At the same time, supply diversification has been shown to build resiliency and minimize the impact of disruption.

For example, by diversifying its supply chains in North America, Europe, and Asia, Toyota was in a very different position in 2016 when an earthquake hit Japan than it was during the 2011 Fukushima disaster when the company produced all parts in Japan. It averted worldwide downtime in 2016.

Prioritize digital tools for greater visibility. The ability to improve supply chain operations hinges on end-to-end visibility. ERP systems, transportation management systems, warehouse management systems, and manufacturing execution systems have allowed organizations over the past decade to create a plethora of unstructured data. This data is at their disposal to drive better insights, visibility, and predictions across the supply chain.

This data can inform necessary facets that will aid in recovery and create transparency, allowing them to estimate available inventory, determine realistic final-customer demand, secure logistics and distribution capacity, and maximize the management of cash flow and working capital.

The ability to aggregate disparate data from different supply chain segments then synergize it into a clear view isn't new to supply chain management. But the pandemic has accelerated this trend.

Nike, for instance, pulled off a pivot during COVID-19 and is an example of how digitization pays off in the long term. A McKinsey podcast shared how Nike was able to mitigate the impact of China-based operations when COVID hit because of its investment in a digital platform linked to its contracted manufacturer. The platform provided an understanding of where goods were in its supply chain. As a result, Nike was able to see the products on hand and re-route the goods toward e-commerce fulfillment centers rather than brick-and-mortar stores. In conjunction, the company shifted its marketing strategy to focus on available inventory rather than planned goods.

Continue to optimize and innovate. Supply chain leaders need to keep their eye on the big picture, future landscapes, and immediate optimizations. The pandemic response was reactive in many ways because strong disaster recovery plans were not in place. It opened our eyes to over-dependencies, workflows that need immediate changes, and opportunities to speed up innovation.

The trend toward direct-to-consumer technologies was amplified in 2020 as online shopping accelerated at lightning speed, and consumer preferences and shopping behaviors shifted. Consumer goods manufacturers and retailers need to rethink operations, build closer ties, and become better equipped to transform capabilities.

Continued optimization and advancement of new opportunities can help decrease human dependency and move supply chains from reactive to responsive as innovative capabilities better equip them today and against future market disruption.

Enable your workforce with AI and low-code solutions

The consumerization of artificial intelligence technologies has empowered everyday knowledge workers to be able to use intelligent software to complete content-centric tasks. There are now no-code and low-code solutions that can be plugged into automation platforms to train and enable digital workers with cognitive skills to read, understand, and make decisions specific to various roles from customs forms, invoices, delivery receipts, waybills, and more. AI- and machine learning-based applications can help eliminate labor-intensive, error-prone processes associated with many supply chain processes and documentation.

—Bruce Orcutt, SVP, Product Marketing, ABBYY

Gaining Visibility into Inventory

Successful retailers have pivoted to prioritizing internal visibility. True visibility into inventory location and fleet availability is what lets shippers activate the appropriate shipping options during the checkout experience.

For example, many retailers don't have the ability to show a specific store's inventory, and they may only be able to offer same-day delivery if orders are shipped from stores. So they can't offer that service reliably for their e-commerce site.

Retailers who can unlock store-specific inventory will be able to offer shorter timeframes for shipping.

One of the pivots that's becoming more common with larger shippers is moving from an internal, first-party fleet to orchestrating delivery through multiple logistics service providers. This is a more demand-driven approach that lets shippers be elastic in responding to surges and falls in demand over time or across different locations or regions. This allows shippers to better control the consignee experience and ensure specific SLAs are met, and deliveries are on time.

—Nick Schurman, Director of Sales, Bringg

On-Demand

The impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and the world underscores the importance of collaboration among colleagues, partners, and customers. The on-demand needs of current supply chains will lead to an increase in digital supply chain platforms. These platforms will enable companies to scale up or down based on demand. This will be made possible by large networks of carrier partners across all modes of transportation providing intelligence in real time.

A digitally empowered adaptive/flexible responsive logistics platform that leverages a global carrier network will enable companies to quickly move to alternate suppliers in other regions when needed and provide better data across multiple resources.

—Glenn Jones, GVP Products, Blume Global

Intelligent Sortation Re-Envisions the Last Mile

As B2B operations shift to direct-to-consumer processes, warehouses are doing less bulk shipping to stores and more individual shipping to residences. This huge increase in parcel volume puts more focus on the role of the last mile. End-to-end supply chain transparency will enable the last mile to meet the future.

AN RFID SOLUTION

More supply chain leaders are adopting a total RFID solution as a means to optimize supply chains and provide end-to-end transparency for each parcel: its location, its contents, its destination, and when it is expected. Automated data-driven approaches in the supply chain are essential to keeping goods moving quickly and accurately.

From manufacturing to end destination, RFID will enable supply chains to meet the rising demands of post-COVID e-commerce. A total RFID solution has the capability to maintain intelligence as well as interpret it throughout the supply chain. Moreover, RFID can enable additional functionalities—specifically intelligent automated sorting in the last mile.

The fundamental element for intelligent sortation is having meaningful data enabled by RFID at the parcel level, partnered with AI. In what may well be its most significant benefit, applying RFID technology to intelligent sortation is the next iteration of a total RFID solution. Ultimately, the flexible capability offered by RFID and intelligent sortation in last-mile fulfillment will allow a more strategic allocation of human resources as well as a significant increase in the speed, accuracy, and volume of parcels to flow through the facility, loaded for final delivery.

We got through 2020 with creative pivots and operational adjustments. In 2021, Many supply chain challenges will persist—from capacity constraints to increasing complexity. the prognosis? A year ahead with ample opportunities for addressing inefficiencies with renewed creativity and digital directives. Experts weigh in on 11 prognostications.

1. Transportation Capacity Remains Tight

With unemployment numbers trending downward and COVID-19 vaccines shipping, truck freight will experience significant growth on the supply side in 2021. With an overall driver shortage expected to continue, recruiting drivers will be a major challenge for trucking companies throughout the United States.

These trucking companies will need to place emphasis on technology solutions, operational improvements, and branding campaigns to recruit drivers in what will continue to be an industry-wide battle for capacity.

This shortage in capacity raises a bigger question: How can companies in the space work together—or autonomously—to make the truck driving profession a more attractive career choice? More importantly, how can companies make truck driving a more enjoyable, rewarding, and financially reliable profession while removing the pains frequently associated with the career?

There is a huge opportunity for companies to make the profession more attractive for younger generations.

—Roy Rosell

Head, Product Marketing

NEXT Trucking

As COVID-19 continues to impact people throughout the world and the United States, its effect on consumer behaviors is forcing companies to rethink their inventories, create supply chain flexibility, and consider more elastic pricing constructs for their transportation in 2021.

In 2020, we went through an 18-month freight cycle in just a few months, which no one could have predicted. This year, we will continue to see tightness in the market due to COVID-19.

Transportation makes up approximately 10% of GDP. With many consumers not traveling, going out, or spending money on things they typically do, they are buying more products. This bodes well for the transportation industry as well as manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.

Another factor that could impact capacity is the possibility of extreme weather throughout the year, which can further change market conditions. In addition, we saw some carriers close, go out of business, or downsize in 2020, which has put some pressure on the market.

—Doug Waggoner

Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO

Echo Global Logistics

The global shipping meltdown of congestion, backed-up ports, and cargo trapped in factories without containers or vessels to ship the goods to buyers in overseas markets was a full-fledged conflagration in late 2020. This is expected to remain until Lunar New Year in February 2021.

Regardless of origin and destination points, the container imbalance will persist well into 2021. Chinese container factories cannot manufacture their way out of this imbalance for the country's exports and the number of containers terminated at ports of arrival translates into zero available equipment for inland exporters for agricultural and manufactured goods, regardless of destination.

Carriers who have profited handsomely from soaring rates in 2020 will need to ask whether or not such sky-high levels can remain in 2021 and from what part of their profits the cost to reposition containers globally will come—and shippers and forwarders alike will strongly voice their opposition to being the financial vehicle to foot the endeavor.

—Tom Bianculli

Chief Technology Officer

Zebra Technologies

Keeping workers safe will top priority lists. While companies have already adapted to the social distancing and sanitizing protocols necessary to keep workers safe, they will also place a greater emphasis on traditional workplace safety concerns, like those involving ergonomic and repetitive stress issues, and other potential injuries that may be caused by working with equipment and pallets.

Amazon hired hundreds of thousands of workers in 2020, an average of more than 2,800 per day between July and December, and both UPS and FedEx staffed up as shipments soared over the holidays. Many of these new workers had been impacted by unemployment spikes in other sectors, such as retail and hospitality.

Although these companies have strong training and safety programs, many workers with less experience in physically demanding supply chain environments will inevitably face challenges.

Empowering the Warehouse Workforce

Businesses will invest more in solutions to support automation and next-generation technologies in the warehouse.

An Assist from AI

In 2021, we'll see manufacturers, logistics companies, and other human-workforce-heavy industries turn to artificial intelligence to speed the adoption of technologies aimed at assisting humans in their tasks.

I predict quality inspection, already in the top 5 applications for AI in manufacturing, will see even greater adoption and widespread deployment.

We'll see AI deployed in the form of inexpensive and lightweight hardware. The economic outlook is such that capital-intensive, complex solutions will be sidestepped for lighter-weight, perhaps software-only, less expensive solutions. This will allow manufacturers to realize ROIs in the short term without massive up-front investments.

It will also give them the flexibility to respond to supply and demand fluctuations—something that we've seen play out on a larger scale throughout the pandemic.

Humans will turn their attention to ""why"" AI makes the decisions it makes. When we think about explaining AI, it has often been talked about in the context of bias and other ethical challenges. But as AI comes of age, gets more precise and reliable, and finds more applications in real-world scenarios, we'll see people start to question the ""why?""

The reason? Trust. Humans are reluctant to give power to automatic systems they do not fully understand. For instance, in manufacturing settings, AI will need to not only be accurate, but also ""explain"" why a product was classified as ""normal"" or ""defective,"" so that human operators can develop confidence and trust in the system and let it do its job.

3. Disruption Will Be a Constant

Disruptive natural disasters continue to significantly impact business operations, worker safety, and transportation. In the western United States, close to 3 million more acres of forest were burned over 2020 due to wildfires in California alone, causing significant business operations and environmental impacts.

Similarly, the Australian continent experienced severe wildfire outbreaks. Additionally, flooding presented a persistent threat in Southeast Asia throughout the year.

With persistent dry conditions in the western United States and Australia and prolonged monsoon seasons in Southeast Asia, as well as a record number of named storms in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, there will likely be continued disruptive natural disasters complicating business operations in 2021.

Additionally, regulatory changes focused on eradicating threats to sustainability, human rights, smuggling, and other issues from business operations will play a large role in 2021. Due to trending issues in human rights violations across the globe, with forced and child labor contributing to a large part of the workforce, regulatory bodies are focusing efforts on imposing sanctions and other standards.

—Jim Yarbrough

Global Intelligence Program Manager

BSI

Supply chain disruptions are common and the rate of disruption seems to be increasing. Weather events, tariffs, labor strikes, manufacturing issues, and more happen all the time—the pandemic being the largest in modern history.

Businesses must be flexible enough to respond quickly when disruptions occur. A fixed logistics model is not designed to be flexible or fast.

The rise of e-commerce and omnichannel retail presents another type of variability: fast change and ongoing uncertainty. Consumer expectations around shipping speeds and costs changed significantly and are still in flux. Making multi-year investments in the face of this uncertainty is highly problematic.

Flexible logistics models, which complement fixed logistics infrastructure with flexibility, will enable resilience. They support variability and uncertainty from supply chain disruptions of all shapes and sizes from high-growth environments to fast-changing consumer preferences.

The combination of fixed and flexible logistics will enable retailers and CPG brands to be efficient, responsive, and resilient.

4. Cold Chain Heats Up

With vaccines front-and-center, the cold chain will take on new importance in 2021.

Supply chain is hard enough, but keeping the entire chain continuously temperature controlled and refrigerated is much more challenging. Yet, that's required for many temperature-sensitive products, including vaccines, medicines, foods, and even chemical products.

Companies need full monitoring, track-and-trace, chain-of-custody, and point-of-origin information across all sites and multiple parties—a challenging task, yet essential for these critical products.

In 2021, business network platforms with these capabilities will increasingly become ""must haves"" for firms that handle such product movements and are charged with monitoring from order to delivery, across all tiers of supply and distribution, to ensure product requirements are met and remain in compliance.

The good news is that by adopting this technology they will help suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers too, as all parties can lower costs and boost service levels by managing resources across storage and multi-modal movements throughout the cold chain.

—Joe Bellini

A Push for Refrigerated Temperatures

The number of viable, approved COVID-19 vaccines will continue to grow in 2021. All else equal, it is likely the market will favor vaccines that require refrigerated temperatures of 2-8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit).

Existing infrastructure exists to more easily transport and store these vaccines around the world. Additionally, refrigerated temperatures eliminate concerns around shortages of dry ice and how it reduces the amount of available cargo space on aircraft.

This preference for refrigerated vaccines could push pharmaceutical companies with deep frozen vaccines to determine how to maintain efficacy of the vaccine at a refrigerated temperature.

5. Supply Chain Complexity Increases

Businesses that relied on single-source suppliers for key components will look to spread the risk over multiple suppliers in different locations. That adds cost to the product since you're transforming business models away from simple bulk purchasing.

There's also a knock-on effect in terms of how products are designed and built. For example, companies may need to be able to accommodate variations in terms of the sub-components they use from a variety of suppliers, which adds an element of complexity.

Pandemic-Driven Shifts Add Complications

Early in the pandemic, companies sought suppliers and manufacturing capacity elsewhere—moving from China to Vietnam, for example. The challenge with this is every other company was doing the same thing.

However, Vietnamese ports are not designed to handle the volume of their Chinese counterparts. This actually increases complexity and, therefore, risk. Companies will need to tackle these massive shifts and resulting complexities in 2021.

Additionally, supply chain's white whale—the last mile—grows even more complex. The last mile has always been the most expensive, long-bemoaned challenge of the supply chain.

The ""homebody economy"" created by the pandemic means more of everything—from hot food to furniture—is being ordered online for delivery, including things that are harder to deliver.

6. E-Commerce Redefined

One thing is clear: The future of e-commerce has arrived. The acceleration of e-commerce will be defined by three factors in 2021 and beyond:

1. Shoppers. The constantly lowering tolerance threshold of shoppers is same-day, and it is headed toward one- to two-hour delivery windows. Research shows that what will keep people shopping online in the long term is not safety, but convenience.

2. Stores. Will the rise of digital commerce mean the end for physical retailers? The data says no. Adobe reports more than half of online shoppers prefer retailers that have both physical and online stores. What will define the future of stores is the experience.

Brands need to take the lessons they've implemented in their e-commerce environments and bring them into the retail space.

The future of malls, for example, could be ""dark stores"" (fulfillment engines for retailers' e-commerce sales) and branded experiences like pop-up shops, which draw inquisitive traffic out of their homes and into the shopping environment.

Post-COVID, retailers will have to consider how to make the in-store shopping experience feel innovative and fresh, but also comfortable and safe.

3. Supply chains. Creating a true omnichannel fulfillment infrastructure will prove critical to ensuring efficiencies in the supply chain that supports brick-and-mortar, click-and-collect, and home delivery.

Margin pressures have made automation a requirement, not a choice. Unable to pass costs on to their customers in this hypercompetitive environment, retailers will need automation to support and bolster margins.

The future of supply chain automation will include more solutions that span the supply chain ecosystem, connecting supply, demand, inventory optimization, fulfillment optimization, and so on. Warehouse automation solutions will depend on software to provide the flexibility to handle fluctuations in demand.

—Hasan Dandashly

Sectors on the Rise

Prepare for a new e-commerce. We can expect expansion in realms such as food and home materials to continue in e-commerce.

Tracking Gets Traction

The acceleration of e-commerce buying behaviors spurred by the pandemic will necessitate soft asset tracking and a new digital standard to enable more agile supply chain operations.

The e-commerce boom has completely changed last-mile distribution and how products are distributed to customers. The sudden increase in online shoppers will fuel the need for supply chain entities to adopt new digital touchpoints to help deliver products both safely and efficiently.

In 2021, last-mile distribution will see larger retail sellers move from operating through large distribution centers to utilizing stores as drop-off points and leveraging them as micro warehouses to complete microfulfillment operations.

However, unlike distribution centers, stores are not equipped with the necessary software to track assets, which is vital for products that require cold chain storage, such as grocery items.

In 2021, supply chain organizations will require continuous, real-time visibility to gain access to valuable insights—such as the location, environmental conditions, and temperature of products—in order to optimize inventory, planning, and logistics, as well as keep up with ever-increasing e-commerce demands and mitigate risk.

FedEx in a Prime Position

In 2019, FedEx made the seemingly bold decision not to renew its contract with Amazon and seek volume elsewhere instead of continuing to take the virtually guaranteed growth of the behemoth.

Turns out, FedEx made a wise decision because Amazon had been filling more and more FedEx equipment with lower margin packages. When the pandemic created a serious acceleration in e-commerce, FedEx showed it could find other shippers that would pay more per cubic foot.

In 2021, FedEx will refine its current products and services and build new ones that meet the needs of a broader swath of e-commerce shippers that may not have the financial, supply chain, or technology resources of Amazon.

7. Collaboration Is Key

Transparency and trust will need to be present in global supply chain management. The future of the industry will begin with partners and their APIs that will help improve the sourcing ecosystem.

All About Networking

Supply chains are out. Supply networks are in. In 2021, companies will focus on strengthening their business networks after seeing firsthand the importance of supplier, co-manufacturer, customer, carrier, and distributor collaboration.

In 2020, companies discovered their legacy enterprise-centric systems no longer were good enough so in 2021 they'll look to modern technology approaches to support tight collaboration around plans, forecasts, orders, shipments, ETAs, and inventories in real time.

Multi-enterprise business networks support collaboration and provide real-time information flows, thus reducing errors and inefficiencies. This allows all sides to work together to satisfy consumer demand at the lowest landed cost and improve their competitiveness. It also provides the ability to on-board suppliers more quickly, as needed to avoid any disruption in supply.

Whether 5 or 105, almost every company runs separate ERP systems to support the business. The massive inefficiencies of these self-imposed business barriers have come to light, and firms recognize they need to be eliminated.

These silos have artificially propped up costly inventory buffers, as companies carry the burden of excess inventory, information delays, and the enormous IT costs of interfaces, maintenance, and upgrades.

Most supply chain professionals inherited this problem, rather than caused it—and now they are desperately trying to fix it.

Moving supply chain processes onto a collaborative business network platform cuts across all these silos and enables a focus on generating value at each step along the way. It's the only option for large enterprises saddled with stitched-together legacy systems. In 2021 more global enterprises will see network solutions as the only viable way to pave a profitable path going forward.

8. Increased Focus On Building Resilience

If 2020 taught us anything, it demonstrated that to maximize resilience and ensure business continuity, companies need to utilize every available channel—e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, retail, distributors, and Amazon. That way, if one channel is disrupted, whether by natural or man-made causes, the show will go on.

In 2021, companies will need to rely even more on supply chain networks to consolidate demand across every channel, and have a view into every point of supply (even containers on ships) to be able to satisfy customer demand, grow revenues, and minimize costs.

Well before 2020, manufacturers, consumer goods companies, and even food producers were already trying to sell directly to the end consumer. Those who have yet to figure out how to maximize this channel find themselves falling behind their peers.

What early adopters learned was the need to determine ""lot size 1"" production and delivery, the needed last-mile logistics, a returns process, and e-commerce technology capable of handling the proliferation of choice and SKUs customers demand.

Resiliency Supports Risk Prevention

The pandemic demonstrated to the world how important resiliency is in the supply chain. Supply chains are complex, global, and increasingly interconnected. When one part of the network is exposed to risk, the rest is vulnerable to disruption.

Consultancy firm McKinsey & Company published a report in 2020 detailing the exact steps that supply chains need to take in order to rebound from the uncertainty of the pandemic and come back stronger, including estimating available inventory to account for a major supply disruption and assessing realistic final-customer demand during the production phases.

In 2021, companies in the supply chain will need to focus on resiliency, in conjunction with risk prevention, to mitigate adverse events faster than the competition, take market share, and outperform.

9. High-Value Goods Will Be Targeted

The pandemic added new and complicated threats to pre-existing supply chain risks. With lockdowns, diminished supplies, and transportation restrictions, drug introduction and smuggling trends shifted. As a result, cargo theft trends changed to focus on newly high-valued targets and locations.

Shifting drug smuggling trends in the Americas will create challenges for operators in port security and other drug introduction points to cargo across the globe.

Additionally, as business operations slowed during COVID-19, cargo criminals shifted operations to target high-value supplies, including medical equipment and warehouse and facility locations for theft. Criminals will likely continue to target high-value commodities, and warehouses and facilities, especially if lockdowns continue to occur globally.

10. Supply Chain Digitaization Accelerates

The pandemic highlights the increased need for digital transformation within the industry, as vaccine distribution wouldn't have been possible without technology such as IIoT sensors to monitor temperature or provide real-time insight into location.

As distribution of the COVID vaccine continues in 2021 and is top of mind for people across the country, we'll see companies make substantive updates to their technology capabilities to improve agility across the supply chain. The vaccine marks a potentially defining moment with such high, mainstream visibility into our industry.

Getting the vaccine quickly shipped and distributed to high-risk populations, and doing it well, will be a proof point of what can be done with an agile supply chain.

In 2021, we'll also see a push behind guaranteeing the chain of custody to ensure genuine products versus counterfeit products in the marketplace. We'll see IoT and technology like blockchain combined for end-to-end counterfeit assurance, to ensure everything from vaccines to retail products are authentic and safe.

Developing a Complete View of the Product Journey

Technology advances like digital twins, AI/ML, and IoT enable more granular tracking and impact the end-consumer experience.

Today, IoT is a ubiquitous technology for supply chain tracking. Applications for AI/ML and digital twin technology have also risen in relevance for the industry.

In 2021, companies will start to employ a concerted strategy around these technologies to construct a complete and real-time picture of products as they move through the supply chain, as well as to obtain prescriptive and predictive analytics to make informed business decisions.

In this strategy shift, we will see the gaps of visibility close where the supply chain has remained most weakened even with the use of IoT alone, such as in low coverage areas when product is in flight, adding critical value to pharmaceutical and food supply chains, which lose billions annually in spoiled products.

Additionally, we can expect to see this visibility get even stronger as 5G takes complete shape most likely in 2022, offering more connection and even more to-the-minute information.

Companies often experience a mess of silos and fragmentation due to being acquired by large companies that have different systems. In 2021, supply chain stakeholders will look to deploy digital twins across all modules as an extra layer of visibility and to ensure synchronization between a existing systems and new technology, such as sensors and nanosensors, which are coming to market in increasingly larger volumes.

11. Sustainability Factors In

""A circular economy is an economic model that encourages continuous reuse of materials to minimize waste, as well as drives demand for natural resource consumption. This concept requires a complete shift in how we view supply chains, from a linear to a circular model, as companies will need to be able to access and reprocess end-of-life products. Companies such as Maersk and Caterpillar are already developing circular economy initiatives and in 2021 we predict many more will begin exploring this concept.""

Adaptive Sourcing

Rate changes, re-negotiations, and reactive spot bidding are occurring with greater frequency and urgency for many companies. It reveals the need for sourcing teams to rapidly adapt.

Carrier and supplier decisions increasingly involve factoring in sustainability and environmental impact, such as CO2 emissions. Prioritizing climate impact requires analyzing that data in relation to other business operation needs and costs to find the optimal sourcing outcome.

Logistics procurement professionals need more assistance from their software solutions to support these heightened demands.

Sustainability in the Resilience Equation

Issues of sustainability in supply chains will play an increased role in how companies operate as governments and regulatory bodies crack down on companies, creating an environment where vetting suppliers and understanding each level of the supply chain is crucial for a resilient organization.

As industry leaders contend with these challenges in 2021, leveraging supplier management and risk intelligence platforms will allow them to understand and proactively manage risk.

Supply Chain Traceability Becomes a Necessity

Tracing chain of custody of materials throughout the supply chain identifies the digital thread for every product and creates a compliance certificate that summarizes each exchange of products and materials from origin to final destination.

This is one option that importers can submit as proof of admissibility and will become critical in the coming months.

Traceability and transparency will continue to gain momentum in 2021. One technology that can help solve this challenge is blockchain.

A blockchain network can track materials and products from source to end customer and, ultimately, the consumer. As more business partners join the blockchain platform, they provide a new level of visibility and connectivity across the supply chain.

The next phase of traceability is assessing the environmental impact of companies' supply chains, from component origin to final delivery to the consumer.

Every facility and supplier in the supply network will be evaluated on criteria such as greenhouse gas emissions, use of renewable energy, waste disposal methods, and water consumption. Retailers will prioritize investing in sustainability tools as consumers demand this from their favorite brands.

10,food supply,MONLAR: Govt. does not care to ensure food security,"The Foreign Ministry on Friday noted with concern the numerous misleading statements contained in the testimony of the Chairperson of the Neelan Tiruchelvam Trust Ambika Satkunanathan, during an exchange of views on the situation of human and labour rights in Sri Lanka at the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights on 27 January, 2022.

The Ministry in a release said: Ms. Satkunanathan’s testimony completely ignores the progress made by the government of Sri Lanka on many fronts and creates doubts about the government’s intents and sincerity, particularly at a time when it is engaged in a long-standing cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms and the UN Human Rights Council and is delivering on its commitment to address accountability and reconciliation through domestic processes and institutions.

The Ministry is disappointed that among the recommendations made by Ms. Satkunanathan is that the EU uses its leverage on GSP plus facility to exert pressure on the government on human rights. If Sri Lanka loses the EU GSP plus facility, particularly at a time when livelihoods of millions of Sri Lankans belonging to all communities are already affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting losses would exacerbate poverty and income inequality. Some of the worst affected sectors will be fisheries and agriculture which are among the key industries in the North and the Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka.

The Ministry also notes that the unfounded allegations about discrimination of ethnic communities in her testimony are reminiscent of LTTE propaganda that once stoked hatred among communities. In a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country such as Sri Lanka, such allegations need to be refuted in the interest of social harmony and to prevent the spread of dangerous fallacies about Sri Lanka in the international community.

The Ministry refutes Ms. Satkunanathan’s claims on ‘a culture of impunity’. The Ministry wishes to point out that the government is engaged in a long-standing cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms as well as with the UN Human Rights Council. Sri Lanka is delivering on its commitment to address accountability and reconciliation through domestic processes and institutions. The government has been actively engaging the international community including the UNHRC’s Universal Periodic Review and Special Procedures to address the various concerns that have been raised. This includes the allegations of systematic torture. The Government has made it clear that additional reforms will be undertaken to further strengthen rule of law, access to justice, and accountability. It remains open to a constructive discussion on suggestions and further steps to address shortcomings.

The Ministry notes that Ms. Satkunanathan makes references to ‘Sinhala Buddhist nationalism’ and ‘militarisation’ as driving the actions of the Government. She makes vague claims of racial profiling in the absence of any concrete evidence of discrimination against minorities. In reply, the Ministry wishes to point out that Sri Lanka is a secular country and all citizens, irrespective of their religion or ethnicity share the same fundamental rights under the Constitution. Furthermore, Sri Lanka ensures access to public services such as free education and free health facilities without any discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or religion. In fact, even during the military conflict when large areas of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces were under the control of the LTTE, the government continued with the provision of such public services to the areas so that the civilians, who were mainly ethnic Tamils and Muslims, would not be affected.

Ms. Satkunanathan points to the Presidential Task Force on Archaeology which she accuses of being a tool for land grabbing and changing the demographics of minority-heavy areas and the Presidential Task Force on “One-Country One Law” which she accuses of stoking ethnic hatred and violence. After the war, as displaced persons returned to the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, there has been an increase in unauthorized encroachment into forest areas inevitably leading to destruction of archaeological sites. So, there is an urgent need to take concrete measures in order to protect these sites. There is no truth in the claims that the Presidential Task Force on Archaeology is a pretext for land grabbing and introducing the Sinhalese to these areas. It may be noted that there is representation of all ethnic communities in this Task Force. With respect to the Presidential Task Force on “One Country One Law,” it should be noted that it is expected to play an advisory role only. The Task Force’s recommendations will be first studied by the Justice Ministry, then the Cabinet of Ministers and finally the Parliament following the democratic traditions.

With regard to her allegations that the Northern and Eastern Provinces are ‘occupied’ by the military, it should be pointed out that the the majority (more than 92%) of the private lands occupied by the military at the end of the conflict in year 2009 have already been released to legitimate land owned civilians. A mechanism is already in place to expedite the process of releasing remaining private lands.

It is particularly disappointing to see Ms. Satkunanathan’s allegations that ‘civic space’ is shrinking and that informal and extra-legal processes are used to curtail the activities of civil society organizations. The Ministry asserts that government views NGOs as partners and not as adversaries. The government acknowledges the constructive contributions made by civil Society organisations in the work of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and Sustainable Development Council of Sri Lanka. It has also introduced certain policy changes to facilitate the work of NGOs such as bringing the NGO Secretariat under the Foreign Ministry. It must be reiterated that apart from operating routine security networks in the interest of national security, particularly after the devastating Easter Sunday terrorist attacks, the Security Forces and intelligence agencies are not engaged in monitoring or targeting any specific group of people in the country.

The Ministry refutes Ms. Satkunanathan’s claims of extra-judicial killings and arrests under the pretext of a “war and drugs.” With regard to the PTA, it should be noted that the government is in the process of amending the Act, which is now at the final stage and the international community is being briefed on that process.

Ms. Satkunanathan also alleges that the government is exploiting its friendship with China to “undermine the efforts of states that call for accountability for human rights violations” in Sri Lanka. On the contrary, mindful of strategic competition that is increasing in the Indo-Pacific region, our main foreign policy directive is to maintain neutrality, in line with the non-aligned foreign policy we have adopted since Independence. The Ministry wishes to point out that apart from China, Sri Lanka has entered into partnerships with several countries such as India and Japan to fill gaps in national infrastructure development. Such partnerships have no bearing on Sri Lanka’s commitment to address accountability and reconciliation through domestic processes and institutions.","Some of the worst affected sectors will be fisheries and agriculture which are among the key industries in the North and the Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka.

11,food supply,Community donates dog food to Emily’s Legacy Rescue,"WICHITA FALLS, Texas (TNN) - A volunteer foster based animal rescue is able to feed displaced cats and dogs thanks to help from the Texoma community.

Emily’s Legacy Rescue was down to one bag of dog food when they made a post to social media.

Saturday they collected bags of puppy and dog food.

Kimber Hopkins, the founder of ELR, says people left bags of food and treats soon after the post.

“We’ve had such a great response. We’ve got some wonderful people in our community. Former adopters that have already dropped off food this morning and said, ' We want to help the animals.’ And we have a great community and when there’s a need everyone steps up,” said Hopkins.

The food will help the five dogs they have at the kennels.

Hopkins says normally the rescue is able to stock up on food for a while because Petco is able to supply them with food when it’s near the expiration date or is an opened bag.

If you were unable to drop off dog food during the food drive, you can leave the items anytime including after hours.

Emily’s Legacy Rescue is located at 1400 W Rathgeber Rd.

12,food supply,Supermarkets strengthen their hold over food supply chain,"Supermarket dominance of the food supply chain has increased as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and farmers should expect downward pressure on prices to continue.

Addressing a Worshipful Company of Farmers question time session on Thursday (28 January), Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright pointed to major changes in consumption patterns over the course of the pandemic.

See also: Adjudicator calls for farmer views on supermarket practices

“One of the unexpected consequences of the Covid crisis is that supermarket power in the market has elevated,” he said.

“When we started the crisis, food consumption was 70% through retail and 30% through ‘out of home’. Now it is 95% and 5%.”

Mr Wright explained that much of that 95% has been delivered through convenience stores, and they had done very well.

“But do not be mistaken, the supermarkets have also done extremely well – and it is in their DNA that price is a critical determinant.”

Mr Wright believed that, in time, consumers could be “educated” to value things like provenance, climate change mitigation and the ethical nature of the production.

But the fact remained that households now spent just 8% of their income on food, compared with 30% in the 1970s and 50% in the 1950s.

“It would be ‘Canute-like’ to pretend that price was not a critical factor – and that’s encouraged by the extraordinary nature of cut-throat competition between our supermarkets,” he said.

High standards

NFU president Minette Batters said it seemed to be that British shoppers “want it all”. But the British farmer has pretty much “done it all”, offering high animal welfare and environmental standards, and the safest food in the world.

“The continual investment in our short, safe supply chains has really paid off,” she said.

But there were real questions about long-term sustainability. Greater efficiencies at the farming and growing end had allowed retail prices for things like milk and strawberries to remain more or less static over the past 20 years.

Farmers needed to know that, as they went further, for example with trying to deliver “net zero” carbon emissions, they would get a return at the farmgate.

“Farmers have got to be able to get more out of the marketplace, and climate change (mitigation) really needs to show that,” said Mrs Batters.

Pain

Mr Wright agreed climate change mitigation was one area where there would have to be some pain for shoppers.

“But the positive is that you have a generation of managers in food and drink businesses for whom this is something they assume must be done. There is a presumptive view that this is a ‘must have’ business objective.”","Supermarket dominance of the food supply chain has increased as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and farmers should expect downward pressure on prices to continue.

13,food supply,Pandemic taught grocery supply chain valuable lessons,"Major inventory disruptions and the simultaneous boom in online shopping brought by the COVID-19 pandemic will reshape the grocery supply chain going forward, consumer packaged goods (CPG), retail and distribution executives said in a panel discussion at the FMI Midwinter Executive Conference.

Session moderator Thom Blischok, chairman and CEO of CPG and retail advisory firm The Dialogic Group, said “the unparalleled impact of COVID-19” on food and beverage retailers and manufacturers — now nearing 12 months — caused an “interruption in the way we do business” and has “necessitated a fundamental restructuring of the retail and manufacturing environment as we see it today.”

FMI-The Food Industry Association

The industry experienced a double-shot: an “explosion in omnichannel” and an overtaxed supply chain, Blischok said in the virtual event, titled “The Post-Pandemic Rubik’s Cube of Supply Chain — Where Do We Go from Here?”.

Related: Online CPG food and beverage sales could top $100 billion in 2021

“Online is now offline, and offline is now online. We will see that journey continue through 2021 and beyond,” Blischok said of the omnichannel growth surge in grocery. “The supply chain absolutely stretched to the limits — broken, in many cases. We saw disruptions in supply itself. We saw disruptions in what was going into the store. We saw disruptions in logistics and distribution.”

Other panelists included Stuart Aitken, chief merchant and marketing officer at The Kroger Co.; David Smith, president and CEO of Associated Wholesale Grocers; Eric Reynolds, executive vice president and chief operating officer at The Clorox Co.; and Steve Oakland, president and CEO of TreeHouse Foods.

""The monomaniacal focus of not just Kroger, but our industry, on the health and safety of our associates and our customers was second to none,” Kroger’s Aitken said. “In fact, one of the things Kroger did was create this Blueprint for Businesses. There was something we wanted to publish to ensure that, whatever we learned, we could share it with everybody. This was a crisis in the U.S., and we had to all look to one another for help, whether it was manufacturers, our supply chain folks, our sourcing folks. Overall, I was so impressed with how we as an industry came together, how we as an industry helped our customers and truly looked after our associates.”

Echoing Aitken, Clorox’s Reynolds said the industry moved with “a speed and a flexibility that I don’t think I’d ever seen in my career, all because we’ve got very clear in what mattered” by focusing on the safety of employees, customers and trading partners and maintaining service in a time of need.

""[Shoppers] didn’t necessarily want to go into stores early on. Because of the fear factor, we had to reimagine every aspect of our supply chain and how we got product to our customers.” — Stuart Aitken, Kroger

""We were not built for this level of volatility, and we’ve seen the fractures in our systems and our technologies. And that’s disappointing, not just to consumers but our retailers who are counting on us and our brand brands in their stores, virtual and otherwise,” Reynolds said. “So I think it’s been both a ton of incredible pride, but also a big dose of reality and humility that we have so much more work to do to never disappoint shoppers.”

The supply-and-demand crisis thrust upon the industry by the coronavirus outbreak provides a big learning opportunity for CPG manufacturers, suppliers and retailers as they take a closer look at what worked and what didn’t in their response, according to AWG’s Smith.

“Everyone understands that whenever the supply is less than what the demand is, everyone’s going to have some level of disappointment. I think that as an industry we have a tremendous opportunity to learn from this because we will have other things we’ll deal with in the future, but we had never really dealt with coming up with a good way to deal with product shortages. We need to be smarter and more nimble with moving the supply around,” Smith explained.

“What we found was that the number of items being sold declined by 18.5%. Consumers were much more precise on what they were buying."" — David Smith, Associated Wholesale Grocers

“Collaboration and partnerships really rose to the top,” he noted. “We reacted very quickly. So I think there are tremendous opportunities for us to apply these things that we’ve learned to build a much more transparent, collaborative relationship all the way from the manufacturers, suppliers and producers to that retail shelf.”

In the private-label arena, where manufacturers produce the same products under multiple labels for retailers, adjusting to the abrupt shifts in demand and supply during the pandemic has proved especially difficult, TreeHouse’s Oakland pointed out.

""We have built a business to harness complexity, but we've done it with no volatility. It really exposed how weak the supply chain is. We were built to master complexity, not to master volatility. And so we’ve got a lot of work to do,” he said. “I’m sure we’ll talk a lot about supply chain as we go forward. But one area, as we work together, is that there are some tools on forecasting. We’re using artificial intelligence, we’re using a number of things to help us with forecasting, that I think can harness some of that. Machines can think through that complexity much better than humans. So I think there’s a real opportunity, but we’ve got a ways to go.”

Reynolds also cited volatility, noting that 1% to 2% growth in many of Clorox’s categories normally would mark “an outstanding year” but the company scrambled to keep products on store shelves amid consumer panic-buying.

“So to go to not just that level of volatility, but now we’ve got this split between online and offline, and the supply chain demands of the speed and responsiveness of forecasting that, it just overwhelmed our systems,” he said. “To do it early on, we’ve had to throw lots of human bridges, which is an imperfect solution. And in the middle of the firestorm is a terrible time to totally reimagine your supply chain. So what we’re trying to do is sort of get as simple as we possibly can and get very clear on what assortments we should have, and then work nonstop to try to handle that level of complexity and then plan for a world of elevated demand.”

“We’ve learned under COVID that the frictions for the average consumer are huge."" — Eric Reynolds, Clorox

Same-store sales at AWG’s member stores jumped 22% from March 11 to Dec. 31, which Smith said was “a blessing” but also revealed a concerning trend.

""What we found was that the number of items being sold declined by 18.5%. Consumers were much more precise on what they were buying, and it causes us to think about the retail selling space that we have in our stores and being merchants, and also our real estate digitally, what we’re promoting and what we’re putting in front of the consumer,” he said. “We’re looking to improve the overall for the benefit of the industry and the benefit of the consumer. Each location will have that secret recipe that it needs to match the needs of the consumer.”

Images of bare shelves in stores, emptied by stockpiling shoppers, presented a picture of where Kroger had to sharpen — and lessen — its focus in meeting skyrocketing consumer demand, according to Aitken. That also traversed the worlds of in-store and online.

“Wherever customers could get their products, whether it was in a Walgreens or Kroger or their corner store, they sorted out,” he said. “But what we also learned was we didn’t have the modalities those customers were looking for. Specifically, they didn’t necessarily want to go into stores early on. Because of the fear factor, we had to reimagine every aspect of our supply chain and how we got product to our customers.”

“There will be some kind of systemic tailwind for the at-home food business. How we continue to serve that consumer well is going to be key."" — Steve Oakland, TreeHouse Foods

Within weeks, Kroger in some cases was down to days of supply — rather than weeks or months — in stores, Aitken added. “I’ll bet every one of you have photos of empty shelves from stores,” he told the panel. “What I ended up doing myself was going around and taking photos of what was still on the shelf. We have to reimagine what the supply chain looks like with a different level of assortment.”

In terms of lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis and looking ahead, TreeHouse’s Oakland expects a shift to a “remote component of the economy that will last well beyond the pandemic.”

“We think at TreeHouse there will be some kind of systemic tailwind for the at-home food business. How we continue to serve that consumer well is going to be key,” he said. “Private label, quite frankly, through this [pandemic] has lost share. It has been a long time since we can feel good about shopper volumes and unit volumes in traditional grocery. That’s going to be what we face in the future, and we can’t let them go away. We’ve got to hold onto them. So we’ve got to delight them in this experience.”

Collaboration will enable industry stakeholders to work smarter and more cost-efficiently as well as “look at the entire relationship with the consumer” across channels, AWG’s Smith explained. “From the relationship between us and our member stores, if we can find places that we can come together and make it easier to do business with us, easier for the manufacturers to be able to communicate and work with our business segment, there are tremendous opportunities,” he said.

Reynolds of Clorox posited that industry “conversations” have gotten “a little further away from that common shopper.”

“I think we’ve learned under COVID that the frictions for the average consumer are huge. They’ve got online shopping, in-store shopping. How do you do that? How do they know what's best for them?,” he said. “If we collaborate on those frictions, that’s really the only way we’re going to delight those families at home when they want to shop or learn about products or brands. And that learning is to go back to the beginning, go back to the consumer, go back to the shopper and try to keep the majority of our conversations centered on that.”

Added Kroger’s Aitken, “We have an opportunity to collaborate fundamentally differently. It’s easy to say, ‘We’re going to put the consumer, the shopper, at the center of everything.’ It’s another thing to actually believe it and execute against it. We’ve got a unique opportunity to seize the moment, seize the day and ensure we genuinely keep the customer.”

14,food supply,How to Fix America's Food System After the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Throughout the pandemic we’ve heard the same rallying cry – let’s not return to what we did before but use this as a moment for thoughtful, strategic change. The food system must be approached in the same way. With the public health crisis making Americans increasingly aware of where their food comes from, business as usual is simply not an option. President Biden’s nominee for Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack served in this role under President Obama and is credited with expanding access to resources for underserved farmers, but systematically changing the system to benefit those farmers will take strong political will. COVID-19 has shown that shorter supply chains and local production are key to a more resilient food system, and he now has an opportunity to proactively shift power to local, small-scale farmers who will best serve their communities.

The idea of a food system designed to prevent hunger and promote healthy food should not be novel. However, since the 1970s the U.S. food system has been hyper-focused on scaling up agricultural production over sustainably producing diverse, nutritious, local food. Today, the overwhelming majority of farms in this country produce just two crops – corn and soybeans – the four largest beef packers control 80% of the market and only 13 slaughterhouses process the majority of all beef consumed in the U.S. Rather than amend or add to what currently exists, the new Administration and the USDA need to design programs and policies based on what is best for local farmers and food systems.

Currently, there is a two-tracked food distribution system in this country for the majority of food products: one being restaurants and the other supermarkets. At the start of the pandemic, restaurants nationwide were forced to shut down, some permanently. At the same time, the virus ran wild in industrial meat-processing plants. Both caused the food supply chains farmers relied on to break. Meanwhile thousands of newly unemployed Americans, including those from the upended food and farming sectors, were forced to join record food bank lines. In stark contrast to our idealized image of the small family farmer and Americana, the pandemic has revealed hunger and poverty among farmers, farm and food industry workers.

Although disruptions in supermarkets were temporary, a system celebrated for its strength has been shown to be alarmingly fragile, failing the very people who fuel it. Farmers saw clearly how inherently dependent they are on other people. Consumer demand had not disappeared–grocery store shelves emptied—but drivers were not picking up food, line workers had been let go from infected plants and restaurateurs lost their restaurants. Without these middlemen, demand was insufficient, and for many farmers with animals and crops that grow regardless of the pandemic, cutting them out was the only solution. Stories emerged of farmers forced to euthanize their animals, dump milk and leave vegetables to rot.

Some farmers and small food producers have been able to switch to e-commerce, engaging in cooperatives in which they can have an equity stake and bypass traditional supply chains. Others managed to find local butchers or smaller plants, and some sold directly to food banks. Those who could shorten their supply chains and turn to local resources survived, and local food systems thrived.

Individuals have also stepped in where the government has failed to do so. Donations to nonprofits are increasing, while farmer delivery services are seeing record sales. The accomplishments of anti-hunger organizations and community-led fresh food initiatives like farmers cooperatives and farm-to-table restaurants are important and impressive. But there is reason to speculate about whether we are working against ourselves. When the government believes charities or others have solved a problem, it sees an opportunity to save money rather than fund the solution. If people step up, our government needs to step up too – not in addition to, but first.

Currently farmers have very few choices for distributing and selling their products, forced to go through channels that are heavily regulated and restricted by the USDA. Small-scale sustainable livestock producers are left with few alternatives. “The biggest problem is that there is no representation from small-scale processors,” said Andy Shaw, owner of Cypress Valley Meat Company, a sustainable small-scale processor in Arkansas. “The people in the room are from industrial agriculture so of course the policies they are influencing reflect their interests.”

One of us has decades of experience in the food industry and now runs an international anti-hunger organization working directly with small-scale farmers in the U.S. and around the world.

We understand the complexities of supply chains and markets as well as how the food system directly impacts individuals. We both agree that what we have done in this country is quite remarkable. We have a food system that delivers, produces and feeds hundreds of millions of people two to three meals every day. The sheer scale is amazing.

But it’s also a failure. The irony of America’s trillion-dollar industrial food system is that millions of people still go hungry every day. According to a Brookings Institute analysis from last year, “13.9 million children lived in a household characterized by child food insecurity in the third week in June, 5.6 times as many as in all of 2018 (2.5 million) and 2.7 times as many than did at the peak of the Great Recession in 2008 (5.1 million).” Yet, it would only cost $25 billion to end hunger in this country.

In responding to COVID-19, we have an opportunity to finally address the root cause of the problem. The incoming Administration has a responsibility to drive systemic change on hunger and nutrition, and that starts with the food system. As conversations continue in the halls of Congress as to how best to kickstart our economy, we have to make sure local farmers are here for the long-term, as part of a healthy and diverse food and farming system.

People want to be able to feed their families with safe, healthy, nutritious food, and they need to be able to afford to do so. We can end hunger in America. We just haven’t had the political will to do it.

15,food supply,Covid crisis is fuelling food price rises for world's poorest | David Malpass,"Over the last year, Covid-19 has undone the economic, health and food security of millions, pushing as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty. While the health and economic impacts of the pandemic have been devastating, the rise in hunger has been one of its most tangible symptoms.

Income losses have translated into less money in people’s pockets to buy food while market and supply disruptions due to movement restrictions have created local shortages and higher prices, especially for perishable food. This reduced access to nutritious food will have negative impacts on the health and cognitive development of Covid-era children for years to come.

Global food prices, as measured by a World Bank food price index, rose 14% last year. Phone surveys conducted periodically by the World Bank in 45 countries show significant percentages of people running out of food or reducing their consumption. With the situation increasingly dire, the international community can take three key actions in 2021 to increase food security and help prevent a larger toll on human capital.

The first priority is enabling the free flow of food. To avoid artificial shortages and price spikes, food and other essential goods must flow as freely as possible across borders. Early in the pandemic, when perceived shortages and panic generated threats of export bans, the international community helped keep food trade flows open. Credible and transparent information about the state of global food inventories – which were at comfortable levels pre-Covid – along with unequivocal free-trade statements from the G20, World Trade Organization, and regional cooperation bodies helped reassure traders, and led to helpful policy responses. Special rules for agriculture, food workers and transport corridors restored supply chains that had been briefly disrupted within countries.

We need to remain vigilant and avoid backsliding into export restrictions and hardened borders that make food – and other essentials – scarce or more costly.

The second priority is bolstering social safety nets. Short-term social safety nets offer a vital cushion for families hit by the health and economic crises. In Ethiopia, for example, households that experienced problems in satisfying their food needs initially increased by 11.7 percentage points during the pandemic, but participants in our long-running Productive Safety Net programme were shielded from most of the negative effects.

The world has mounted an unprecedented social protection response to Covid-19. Cash transfers are now reaching 1.1 billion people, and innovative delivery mechanisms are rapidly identifying and reaching new groups, such as informal urban workers. But “large scale” is not synonymous with “adequate”. In a review of Covid-19 social response programmes, cash transfer programmes were found to be:

Short-term in their duration – lasting just over three months on average

Small in value – an average of $6 (£4.30) per capita in low-income countries

Limited in scope – with many in need remaining uncovered

The pandemic has reinforced the vital imperative of increasing the world’s investments in social protection systems. Additional measures to expedite cash transfers, particularly via digital means, would also play an important role in reducing malnutrition.

The third priority is enhancing prevention and preparedness. The world’s food systems endured numerous shocks in 2020, from economic impacts on producers and consumers to desert locust swarms and erratic weather. All indicators suggest that this may be the new normal. The ecosystems we rely on for water, air and food supply are under threat. Zoonotic diseases are on the rise owing to growing demographic and economic pressures on land, animals and wildlife.

A warming planet is contributing to costlier and more frequent extreme weather events. And as people pack into low-quality housing in urban slums or vulnerable coastal areas, more are living in the path of disease and climate disaster.

Development gains can be wiped out in the blink of an eye. Our experience with hurricanes or seismic events shows that it is more effective to invest in prevention, before a catastrophe strikes. That’s why countries need adaptive social protection programmes – programmes that are connected to food security early warning systems and can be scaled up in anticipation of shocks.

The time is long overdue to shift to practices that safeguard and increase food and nutrition security in ways that will endure. The to-do list is long and urgent. We need sustained financing for approaches that prioritise human, animal and planetary health; restore landscapes and diversify crops to improve nutrition; reduce food loss and waste; strengthen agricultural value chains to create jobs and recover lost incomes; and deploy effective climate-smart agriculture techniques on a much greater scale.

The World Bank Group and partners are ready to help countries reform their agriculture and food policies and redeploy public finance to foster a green, inclusive, and resilient recovery.

Focusing on food security would address a basic injustice: almost one in 10 people live in chronic hunger in an age of food waste and plenty. This focus would also strengthen our collective ability to weather the next storm, flood, drought, or pandemic – with safe and nutritious food for all.","Over the last year, Covid-19 has undone the economic, health and food security of millions, pushing as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty.

16,food supply,Smart packaging: Connecting the physical with the digital,"In today’s food industry, a product’s package is every bit as important as its contents. Today’s packaging can be smart, embedded with technology that offers a range of functionality. According to research from Smithers Pira in “The Future of Active & Intelligent Packaging,” the smart packaging market is forecasted to grow at an annual average rate of 5.9%, reaching $7.56 billion by 2023.

Jan Schnitker, CEO and co-founder of Is It Fresh, a deep-tech startup that develops and produces supply chain digitalization technology, says that smart packaging is an umbrella term referring to packaging systems that have extended functionalities beyond only containing and protecting the package’s contents, using technology such as embedded sensors.

Jan Schnitker, CEO & co-founder, Is It Fresh Thomas Dunn, independent consultant, EAS Consulting Group Aric Prost, Sr. Director OEM, Stratus Technologies

“At Is It Fresh, we think of smart packaging as the enabler connecting physical assets with the digital platform,” he says.

There are two forms of smart packaging: active packaging and intelligent packaging. Active packaging involves adding or removing components into the packaged food or immediate surroundings to improve the product’s shelf life or quality, such as absorbers to remove oxygen from the package. Intelligent packaging refers to packaging that can do “intelligent” functions such as track the product, sense an attribute of the packaged food or its immediate environment (e.g., pH, temperature), and communicate it to the user (such as manufacturer or consumer).

As well, connected packaging is a subset of intelligent packaging, referring to applications that communicate with other packages, smart appliances or the internet to provide consumers unique content or value-added digital experiences.

Aric Prost, Sr., director of OEM, Stratus Technologies, sums up smart packaging as that which improves scheduling, tracking and achieving better utilization of equipment along with faster repair times.

For food processors, smart packaging can offer many benefits. According to Thomas Dunn, independent consultant at EAS Consulting Group, a firm that works in FDA- and USDA-regulated industries, smart packaging—particularly connected packaging—provides processors with powerful tools for complying with their product tracing and recall responsibilities in their food safety management programs.

“At present, printed symbols on packages decoded by optical (line of sight) sensors (e.g., bar and QR codes) are widely used,” he says. “Systems with omnidirectional decoding ability (e.g., RFID tags) are economical for transport packaging units, such as shipping cartons, but present cost and information management hurdles at the individual shelf item scale.” Current development efforts show promise in reaching the goal of producing RFID-type symbols on packages at the same minimal cost as today’s code-dating technology, Dunn adds.

Schnitker adds that smart packaging and automated supply chain management will significantly reduce costs and increase profits. “There are plenty of use-cases that are enabled through smart packaging, specifically if this smart packaging is introducing digitalization at the same time,” Schnitker says.

He says that typical benefits include:

Traceability—the serialized package and its production meta-information that can be shared with value-chain participants and easily be read out via near-field communication (NFC)

Ability to distinguish and provide transparent evidence of quality standards through a technology-layer

In-situ production parameter control, reducing risks for out-of-specification production

The reduction of lab costs for quality control

Connecting the food processor with the end customer

Handling of product recalls efficiently with a much lower potential for brand damage

He points out that food processors can enhance their reputation on societal/environmental responsibility by reducing food wastage through this technology.

“The food processor is probably one of the most important, if not the key enabler of its value chain to reduce the excessive waste in developed countries,” Schnitker says. “Food needs to be smart right from its manufacturing/packaging process to capture the immense potential and profits.

“According to a Boston Consulting Group report, $1.2 trillion worth of food is wasted or lost per year, hitting about $1.5 trillion by 2030. What is maybe even more interesting food processing and packaging has an average loss/waste of about $0.82 per kg that can partially be recuperated with smart packaging. Food processors that realize this win-win from scenario an economical and sustainability standpoint earlier than their competitors will have a huge competitive advantage,” he says.



Integration

Food processors can integrate this technology a number of ways. Schnitker says the first step is the physical integration, which happens in different ways depending on the packaging type, label technology and sensor technology used. A typical integration would be a pressure-sensitive adhesive that is applied to the inside or outside of the packaging, which does not differ in its complexity to industry-standard labels. So it can be as easy as exchanging the label type or adding a label.

Smart packaging that uses chemical sensors and evaluates freshness via a liquid or gas-sensing principle requires a “molecular pathway"" to the sensor element. “This can happen through direct contact or through membrane materials in such a way that the analyte is able to reach the sensing element,” Schnitker says. “The entire sensor and label can also be embedded in the packaging stack in more advanced scenarios. Food processors would simply purchase a different packaging type from their packaging supplier.

The second step is digital integration during production. The smart food package would pass by, for example, on a conveyor belt through an NFC and optical readout tunnel that registers the smart label in real-time, associates all the product information, and generates the first measurement of the quality. “This process happens with a complete IT/OT-integration, full cloud-support, and automatic data analysis. Essentially any manufacturing line can be retrofitted with such a solution very cost effectively,” he says.

Dunn says some food processors are taking advantage of QR codes on packages and smart devices in consumers’ hands to leverage printed but space-limited label or package data with dynamic product information available on the Internet.

“Proposed FDA proposals regarding food traceability records for certain foods require that electronic sortable spreadsheets, containing relevant traceability information, be available to the agency within 24 hours its request. Package QR codes will support real time consumers access to lot identifiers of these foods during FDA recall investigations,” says Dunn.

Prost notes that embedding track/trace capabilities can take a number of forms. “[Stratus] enable[s] control or software to be operated on machine (addressing latency issues), on prem [on-premises infrastructure] and/or in the cloud. Our high availability and redundant options mean that concerns about losing this critical data are minimized,” he says.



Evolution

According to Dunn, the most practiced form of smart packaging involves time temperature indicators (TTIs), originally proposed in the early 1950s. These devices—usually for products with refrigerated or frozen storage and distribution—document thermal exposure and may estimate the remaining shelf life of perishable products, he says. Indicators take several forms: irreversible chemical color changes resulting from the accumulated effects of time and temperature on a distinctive image; enzyme-caused color changes proportional to cumulative time above an activation temperature; thermal expansion thermometers with ongoing data logging.

“TTI-functionality for packages provides more value for the supply chain upstream of consumer display where environmental monitoring data is available to verify on-package information and support save vs. discard decisions. Temperature dependence of the efficacy of some pharmaceuticals (not only their safety) gives more value to TTI technology for those products than does its use for packaged food point-of-use,” Dunn says.

Dunn notes that in spite of recent allegations about using code dating of packaged foods to prompt consumers to waste otherwise good food, smart packaging functionality is not a favored solution. “The commercial implications of letting consumers use package color changes to distinguish between products that are good and safe and those that are spoiled or unsafe are substantial: product liability for unsafe products labeled as ‘safe’ and the lost value of prematurely identified ‘out-of-date,’ unsalable products. These concerns dictate that the precision and accuracy of information be faultless. False negatives put spoiled or unsafe smart packaging product in consumer households while false positives risk substantial waste of good food,” says Dunn.

Schnitker adds, “Many of the available solutions in the market are also expressing ‘smartness,’ such as a freshness indicator on packages that changes color to indicate the chemical spoilage of food, which are very helpful in many ways but don't help a large amount of supply chain participants,” he says.

According to Dunn, TTI technology has evolved to more advanced biological (e.g., enzymatic) and physical (e.g., differential thermal expansion) techniques. “For valuable, temperature-sensitive food products, careful monitoring and data logging of ambient storage and transport temperatures provide cost and accuracy advantages over on-package TTI technology,” he says.

Additionally, he says that there is an array of smart packaging definitions among specific segments in the industry. “We believe that one distinctive element will be two criteria. First, there is the digitalization criteria. If we abstract the goals of packaging looking into the future, it would be reasonable to argue that it has evolved from being a mere ‘container’ of food product that is simply a barrier between the food product and the outside to a ‘communicator.’ Or, a connector that links the physical world and the digital world, as well as connecting the product to the consumer with different means like a sensor or display technology.

“We believe that there is another criterion that is going hand in hand with customer needs—it is becoming visible to the customer. Previous advances of smart packaging with better diffusion barriers, modified atmosphere packaging and many other very useful technologies are barely noticed by the end consumer. This relationship will change, in our opinion,” Schnitker says.

“Our particular angle at Is It Fresh is the ultra-cost-efficient transformation of the physical asset into a digital asset that fulfills both criteria mentioned above in the sense of a ‘connected product’ that utilizes advanced packaging materials and sensor technology to provide real-time info and analytics on dozens of parameters for full end-to-end tracking for every supply chain participant—so a B2B2C-compatible solution,” he says.



Challenges

Smart food packaging inherently involves the delivery of information about that food to a responsible party—a consumer, warehouse manager, delivery driver, etc. Dunn says that information is not an end in itself, but rather support for a decision by the receiving party. “Should the consumer buy that package or not? Should the warehouse manager discard product that experienced excessive heat? Should the driver check the thermostat in his truck? Unless and until smart packaging can deliver timely, accurate and dependable information to support decision-makers at specific points in the food supply chain, it remains no more than an interesting tool for which no useful function exists—a solution in search of a workable problem to resolve.”

Definitive code dating of packaged products presents an unsolved problem, Dunn says.

“[This is a] difficult challenge that remains unworkable for now, but no less important because of the difficulty. The science of product ‘shelf life’ estimation distinguishes many critical input variables for which accurate sensors and data are simply lacking… product condition prior to packaging, protection by its packaging, physical forces to be encountered during transport; temperature and humidity during storage and display; cellular chemistry; genetic varieties; to name but a few.” Consumer partiality toward freshness and locally sourced products indicate their preferences for packaged foods with “first-day” quality. Dunn says that until food science defines for each food (actually for each recipe and process) that quality’s biologic, chemical and physical dimensions and their tendencies to change over time, no package is “smart enough” to signal that a food’s shelf life has expired.

Schnitker says that Is It Fresh is tackling these challenges. “First, we determine the label type and the integration, for example, by providing a roll of tags that is compatible with existing label dispensing systems or planning the necessary changes. This step depends heavily on the packaging type and can vary from very simple to complicated.” He says that advanced packaging integration questions are best answered with the supplier of the packaging material. “The biggest challenge for the easiest smart labels is less of a technical nature and more from a management and innovation perspective.”

He says the second challenge is the readout technology on the manufacturing floor, which must be integrated without any significant downtime into an existing line. “This is usually a very long and tedious process with a variety of partners from the electrical IT/OT side to the data management, ERP integration, etc. Often enough, this would not be feasible as a retrofit solution without shutting down lines for a long time,” Schnitker says.

“We are taking this entire issue out of the equation with our turnkey approach that is compatible with any existing system. We provide a drop-in solution that can always be used as an aftermarket installation. Typically, a tunnel is about 1 m in length that we put over a free segment into the line without modifying or touching existing installation, only requiring power and any form of internet connectivity via Ethernet, WiFi or 4G/5G.” He says the tunnel is completely self-sustained but has electrical connectivity to other systems if required.



In the Pipeline

Dunn says that in a high-tech, information-driven economy, the most valuable smart functionality from a package will be an ability to connect that package to the Internet of Things (IOT) that electronically stores and retrieves all food chain transactions involving the package together with the identity of parties responsible for those transactions. “Package code dating currently provides package-specific analog information that links to the food chain. Machine-readable (digital) code dating will likely provide the entry point for truly smart packages.”

When looking to the future, Schnitker says, “We believe that advanced sensor systems like ours will become in one way a standard. There will be large arrays of the sensor system and a very high degree of connectivity for efficient supply chains on the B2B side and equally a better end-consumer user experience (UX) with the ‘connected products.’ We also see a huge spike in direct-to-consumer food products like HMR/meal-kits. The pandemic has boosted this huge trend, and the integration of smart packaging is key for the logistics and delivery process.”

There will be large arrays of the sensor system and a very high degree of connectivity for efficient supply chains on the B2B side and equally a better end-consumer user experience (UX) with the ‘connected products.’

“Nearly every risk metric rises with the trend to avoid well-established packaging technology, which ultimately leads to even more waste. The idea of saving a few grams of plastic, which can be recycled, stands in contrast to ecological CO 2 footprint of nearly food product, which is orders of magnitude more valuable than plastic. Additionally, recycling of biodegradable materials is a challenge on its own,” Schnitker adds.

17,food supply,Tiny home used for takeout offers quality food for anyone in downtown Kitchener,"It may be small, but the new Tiny Home Takeout in front of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in downtown Kitchener can produce 12 personal pan pizzas in three minutes and at least 150 soups in the two hours it's open.

So says Father Toby Collins, who was behind the initiative to serve fresh quality meals for free regardless of a person's economic standing.

It's an idea he came up with while sitting down to eat with other members of the religious community.

""I was like, why can't they eat what we're eating tonight,"" Collins said. ""This troubles me that people eat this emergency food supply and sometimes it comes out of a can. And I'm like, we can do better than this.""

He reached out to people and organizations in the region who had expressed an interest in community outreach.

That led to a kitchen renovation in the church basement and the design of the tiny takeout hut in front of the church.

A lot of the food is donated locally by restaurant suppliers in the region and prepared by chef Amy Cyr.

Some people who can afford to pay are dropping off donations when picking up food.

""We're also getting a lot of people who have means coming by and saying, 'I want to contribute' and we're like, 'Take food with you first.' They're a little shy. They're like, 'No, it's for somebody else.' We're like, 'It's for everybody.' And they make a donation,"" said Collins.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Professors Tim Lang of City, University of London, Erik Millstone of Sussex University and Terry Marsden of Cardiff University said a lack of government focus on healthy eating amounted to “a dereliction of duties”.

“The public needs clear nutritional advice on how to eat to enhance their immune responses in the pandemic and people need to have the financial resources to obtain those foods,” said Millstone.

“Poor diet and poor health has undoubtedly contributed to the UK’s appalling COVID death rate, particularly among families on low incomes.”

Millstone said food poverty was now in the “neo-Victorian mode” of relying on food banks, which could not keep up with demand.

The UK has the world’s fifth-highest official death toll from COVID-19. It reported a further 1,239 deaths on Thursday, taking the total to 103,126.

Asked why the toll was so high, work and pensions minister Therese Coffey told GMTV on Monday it was partly due to Britain’s ageing population and its high obesity levels.

The academics called for the creation of a Food Advisory Group for Emergencies and urged authorities to detail foods Britons should eat to protect their health.

They also criticised the absence of a national strategy for food when COVID-19, Britain’s departure from the European Union and climate change increased the risks to security of supply.

In response, the British government said the country has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain which has coped well in responding to unprecedented challenges.

“We continue to work closely with the food industry, who are well prepared to ensure people across the country have the food and supplies they need,” said a government spokesman.
