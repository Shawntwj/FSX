In that regard, flood is amorphous, as it can distort and temporarily erase forms and features from the visible landscape—nothing that could be described as a “scape” in the sense of articulated and meaningful scenery.
In my forthcoming book, Floodscapes, I explore humanity’s past relationship to flood processes, from ancient and mythical floods to the rise of environmental policies, as well as a selection of contemporary projects.
This new model sees a logic of negotiated cohabitation with natural processes replace the old narratives of heroic fight, hypothetical conquest, and absolute safety.
They allow us to build combinatory and consensual adaptation strategies, and they encourage stakeholders and architects of regional planning to play an active role in this historical enterprise.","landscapes, adaptation, natural, processes, floodscapes, terms, flood, designed, rivers, strategies, regard, environmentally, sound"

A Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) flood impact assessment team, comprising soil and horticultural specialists, hit the ground in Carnarvon earlier this week.
Other affected growers, who would like to arrange an assessment, can contact DPIRD's Carnarvon office.
A 10 kilometre section of the highway north of Carnarvon, from the Blowholes through Minilya to Burkett Road, was completely washed away with the severity of the floods.

These images show flooding on January 30, 2021, seven days after Eloise made landfall near the coastal city of Beira.
After crossing northern Madagascar and before making landfall on mainland Africa, Eloise slightly strengthened due to warm waters in the Mozambique Channel.
Most of the areas hit by Eloise are still recovering from cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019, which claimed hundreds of lives.
After making landfall in Mozambique, Eloise continued across southern Africa, though in a weakened state.","mozambique, floods, storm, landfall, making, africa, eloise, beira, water, images, flooding"

“With such higher rainfall rates in Kerala, it is necessary to protect the land from excess soil erosion as the rainfall quantitatively represents the impact on the soil surface,” he added.
The vegetative land was converted to near barren condition due to the floods, making it further susceptible to soil erosion.
On similar lines, the rate and total amount of sediment deposited increased dramatically during the 2018 floods, with Idukki being the worst affected.

The connections between warming trends and extreme weather aren’t completely understood, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that there’s a connection between climate change and rising damage from hurricanes, typhoons, rainstorms, wildfires and heat and cold.
In the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, this has led to a decrease in the contrast between the heat of the equator and the cold of North Pole.
The strength of the summer jet stream, a river of wind that propels weather systems around the globe, depends on extreme temperature differences between these two regions.
As the planet warms and this contrast diminishes, the jet stream weakens and can no longer push large weather patterns out of the way.","planet, weather, floods, summer, pole, warming, climate, change, north, jet, ice, heat, stream, extreme"
