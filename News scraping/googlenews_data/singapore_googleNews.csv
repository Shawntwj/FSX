0,singapore,Singapore says police will be given access to Covid-19 contact tracing data,"Singapore has announced its police will be able to use data obtained by its coronavirus contact-tracing technology for criminal investigations, a decision likely to increase privacy concerns around the system.

The technology, deployed as both a phone app and a physical device, is being used by nearly 80% of the 5.7 million population, authorities said, after announcing its use would become compulsory in places such as shopping malls.

The TraceTogether scheme, one of the most widely used in any country, has raised privacy fears but authorities have said the data is encrypted, stored locally and tapped by authorities only if individuals test positive for Covid-19.

“The Singapore police force is empowered ... to obtain any data, including TraceTogether data, for criminal investigations,” the minister of state for home affairs, Desmond Tan, said on Monday in response to a question in parliament.

The privacy statement on the TraceTogether website says: “Data will only be used for Covid-19 contact tracing.”

Privacy concerns have been raised about such apps in various places, including Israel and South Korea.

“Concerns have focused on data security issues associated with the collection, use and storage of the data,” law firm Norton Rose Fullbright said of Singapore’s scheme in a review of global contact-tracing technology last month.

Asked about the TraceTogether privacy statement by an opposition MP, Tan said: “We do not preclude the use of TraceTogether data in circumstances where citizens’ safety and security is or has been affected, and this applies to all other data as well.”

Dissent is rare in Singapore, which has been ruled by the same party since its independence in 1965, has strict laws, widespread surveillance and restrictions on public assembly. Serious crime is also rare.

The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has previously said privacy concerns about the technology had to be weighed against the need to curb the spread of the virus and keep the economy open.

Singapore has reported only a handful of local Covid-19 cases in the past few months, and its extensive disease surveillance and contact tracing efforts have won international praise including from the World Health Organization.

Australia based its own contact tracing app, Covidsafe, on the TraceTogether app source code.

The New South Wales Department of Health said last year that one major issue with the app – which would also have privacy implications if used by law enforcement – was falsely identifying close contacts.

“There were neighbours in the same apartment buildings or nearby houses, there were office workers who worked on different floors in the case, there were people who were in different restaurants with the case, [or] that was still on the same street or perhaps a few doors down or even over the road from the case,” researcher Jana Sisnowski said.

1,singapore,Singapore’s police now have access to contact tracing data,"Why it matters: Our Covid Tracing Tracker notes the privacy policies for dozens of apps around the world that notify users of potential exposure to covid-19. Although Singapore’s general attitudes about data privacy may not mirror what’s happening elsewhere, contact tracing apps around the world have raised questions of user privacy since the first were launched last year. The news from Singapore hits on activists’ and ethicists' concerns about data misuse, and groups like Human Rights Watch have outlined how surveillance could further hurt already marginalized communities.

In a recent essay in the journal Science, bioethicists Alessandro Blasimme and Effy Vayena from ETH Zurich in Switzerland said that the “piecemeal creation of public trust” was an important missing ingredient if we want more people to use these apps.

Data is still important: This isn’t the first time the use of contact tracing data has intersected with law enforcement. Last July, German restaurants, bars, and patrons raised objections when it was reported that police used information collected in contact tracing to track down witnesses in investigations. And in late December 2020, New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed a law that prohibits law enforcement and immigration authorities from accessing contact tracing data. Groups like the New York Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the New York Immigration Coalition applauded the move.

2,singapore,Police's ability to use TraceTogether data raises questions on trust: Experts,"SINGAPORE - The revelation that TraceTogether data can be used for police investigations has raised questions over trust in government, especially in relation to data privacy, said observers on Tuesday (Jan 5).

Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University said the news came across as the Government backtracking on its earlier assurance that TraceTogether would be used only for contact tracing.

""It clearly undermines their trust and credibility,"" said the former Nominated MP.

""This damage could undermine its future efforts, given its reiteration that Singapore has managed to keep Covid-19 under control due only to the people's trust in the Government's measures.""

Former Nominated MP Calvin Cheng said in a Facebook post that the Government ""should have been upfront that some privacy will be sacrificed for safety and security"".

After Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan on Monday said police are empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to obtain TraceTogether data for criminal investigations, netizens were quick to cite remarks by Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan during a June 8 press conference.

He had said then that TraceTogether data would be used ""purely for contact tracing, period"".

Addressing the House on Tuesday in an unscheduled statement on the issue, Dr Balakrishnan said: ""Frankly, I had not thought of the CPC when I spoke earlier.""

National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser noted that Singaporeans generally have a high degree of trust in the Government.

But he suggested that an additional layer of safeguards should be created to allay concerns about data privacy, and make sure such data is not misused.

This could come in the form of a committee comprising prominent public figures to which the police would be accountable to, should they plan to use the TraceTogether data, he said.

""I don't think there's an easy, straightforward response to this issue,"" he added. ""The best safeguard, in my view, is the degree to which citizens trust the Government and Police that any data collected would only be used to protect citizens, rather than against them.""","SINGAPORE - The revelation that TraceTogether data can be used for police investigations has raised questions over trust in government, especially in relation to data privacy, said observers on Tuesday (Jan 5).

3,singapore,PM Lee Hsien Loong receives first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,"Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for their staff on Friday. SGH estimated about 90 of its employees will get vaccinated on the first day.



The official roll out comes after a small-scale test run at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where 40 employees received their jabs on Dec 30.



Speaking to reporters at SGH, Mr Lee said he was happy to see the start of inoculations for healthcare and frontline workers.



""I took the opportunity to have my own jab this morning and now I'm done – 30 minutes waited, nothing happened,"" he said.

""I've got my card, and the appointment to come back in three weeks' time. It's painless, it's effective and it's important.""","Public healthcare institutions, including hospitals and polyclinics, will start vaccinations for their staff on Friday.

4,singapore,PM Lee receives Covid-19 vaccine as Singapore starts nationwide vaccination drive,"SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong took the Covid-19 vaccine on Friday (Jan 8) morning, at the start of a nationwide drive to vaccinate staff across various public healthcare institutions.

Also vaccinated were the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak, along with 88 healthcare workers from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

""It's painless, it's effective and it's important,"" Mr Lee said, speaking to reporters after the 30-minute observation period following the jab was up. ""I hope that Singaporeans will take it up as we roll it out.""

He added: ""We've got ample vaccines coming in. We ordered them early, we have enough for everybody in Singapore - all the residents, all the citizens and even the non-citizens who are staying here.""

The Prime Minister was at SGH to observe the start of inoculations for healthcare workers, and said he took the opportunity to get his own vaccine.

He was jabbed in his right arm, as he is left-handed, and will return in three weeks for the second dose.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two injections, given 21 days apart, and all who are vaccinated will be issued a vaccination card to remind them of follow-up appointments.

""The needle was very fine,"" Mr Lee added in Mandarin. ""You can hardly feel it when it goes in.""

He urged all Singapore residents to get the vaccine when it is available to them. ""It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer too, so please take it when you get it.""

Administering the vaccine was senior staff nurse Fatimah Mohd Shah, 41, who gave the Prime Minister advice on what to look out for after his jab and took a photo with him afterwards.

""I felt happy and honoured to administer the vaccine for PM (Lee),"" said Ms Fatimah. ""Of course, I was a bit nervous, yes.""

PM Lee said last month that he and his Cabinet colleagues would be getting vaccinated early, to show Singaporeans they believe the vaccine is safe.

6,singapore,Overseas travel to remain difficult even after all in Singapore get Covid-19 vaccine: Gan Kim Yong,"SINGAPORE - International travel will not revert to normal even after everyone in Singapore has been vaccinated as travel depends on the global Covid-19 situation, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

When it does resume, it is likely to take place progressively, through bilateral arrangements, which could then expand into regional arrangements, he added.

""This is a bit like a circuit breaker,"" said Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force handling the crisis. ""It's not going to be, flip a switch and (it's) free for everybody to travel.""

He was responding to a question on whether Singaporeans can expect to travel in the next 12 months during a press conference to mark one year of Singapore's battle with Covid-19.

Education Minister Lawrence Wong, the task force's other co-chair, acknowledged that many people hope that vaccination will allow them to travel without quarantine restrictions.

But at present, Singapore is still studying the evidence and is not yet ready to change the rules, he said.

In any case, Singapore is likely to be in ""pandemic mode"" for the next 12 to 18 months even if certain safe distancing measures are eased in that time, Mr Wong added.

""Even if the majority of people in Singapore get vaccinated, it's impossible for the world to be vaccinated by this year,"" he said. ""Which means that all around us, there will be countries where the virus may very well still be raging.""

He also pointed out that the International Air Transport Association has predicted that passenger volumes are not expected to return to pre-coronavirus levels until at least 2024.

""The whole recovery is not a one-year issue... it's more like a four-year affair before you see some of these industries recovering back to where they were before,"" Mr Wong said.

""So that's the picture for aviation and travel, and we have to be realistic that this is what it is, and it will have some impact on our own industries, particularly those that are reliant on aviation and tourism.""","SINGAPORE - International travel will not revert to normal even after everyone in Singapore has been vaccinated as travel depends on the global Covid-19 situation, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

7,singapore,"More than 113,000 people in Singapore receive first dose of COVID-19 vaccine: MOH","SINGAPORE: More than 113,000 people have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in an update on Thursday (Jan 28).

More than 50 have also received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.

The numbers are expected to go up in the coming weeks as vaccination operations continue, MOH said.

Polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) will also serve as vaccination sites. Seniors can currently be vaccinated at nine polyclinics and 21 PHPCs.

From next Monday, all 20 polyclinics across Singapore will also begin offering COVID-19 vaccinations, MOH said.

Vaccinations for senior citizens aged 70 and above began on Wednesday at Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar.

More than 250 were vaccinated on the first day, MOH said.

Sign-ups for COVID-19 vaccination by seniors have been encouraging, the ministry said, adding that it expects more seniors to sign up in the coming days.

""As of Jan 27, we have sent personalised letters to more than 10,000 seniors in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, and more than one-third of them have booked their appointments within two days of receiving the invitation,"" MOH said.

""The remaining seniors in these areas will receive their invitation letters in the coming week.""

These letters will be progressively sent out to seniors across Singapore from mid-February.

To ensure seniors can conveniently receive their required jabs, more vaccination centres will be set up over the next few weeks. These will be located in ""high population catchment areas and/or along major public transport routes for greater accessibility"".

""In total, there will be around 40 vaccination centres, with each vaccination centre planned for an estimated capacity of 2,000 vaccinations per day,"" the ministry said.

MOH, HSA MONITORING VACCINE SAFETY

MOH and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said they were closely monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as it is being administered to our population.



“Among the more than 113,000 individuals who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, HSA has received 432 adverse event reports from healthcare professionals as of 27 January 2021,” said MOH.

“Most of these reports were for regular symptoms such as injection site pain and swelling, fever, headache, fatigue, body aches, giddiness, nausea and allergic reactions (such as itch, rash, swelling of eyes or lip). These symptoms are reactions generally associated with all vaccinations and they generally resolved on their own within a few days.”

MOH also added there were three reported cases of anaphylaxis among those who received the COVID-19 vaccine.

The instances of anaphylaxis – or rapid onset of severe allergic reactions – were quickly resolved by healthcare professionals.

“The individuals, in their 20s and 30s, developed multiple symptoms such as rash, breathlessness, lip swelling, throat tightness and giddiness,” said MOH.

“All three individuals had a history of allergies, including allergic rhinitis and food allergy such as to shellfish, but none had a history of anaphylaxis which would have precluded them from receiving the vaccine.""

Anyone who develops anaphylaxis to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should not receive the second dose, according to MOH's website.

8,singapore,Singapore to restrict entry of some travellers from South Africa after reports of new COVID-19 strain,"SINGAPORE: People with a travel history to South Africa within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore starting Monday (Jan 4), the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced.

The restriction will apply to long-term pass holders and short-term visitors, including those who have obtained prior approval to enter Singapore, the ministry said in a press release on Friday.

Returning Singaporeans and permanent residents will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arriving in Singapore at the start of their 14-day stay-home notice.

""These test requirements do not apply to those who are only transiting through Singapore,"" said MOH.



The tighter border measures will be put in place given the ""deteriorating situation in South Africa"", said the ministry, and to prevent the spread of a potentially more contagious strain of the COVID-19 virus circulating in South Africa.

“While the strain has been suggested to be more transmissible, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine if this strain is associated with any change in disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy,” it added.

“These aspects are being investigated. MOH will evaluate the data as it emerges and review our border measures accordingly.”

South Africa confirmed a record 17,710 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, with a positivity rate of 33 per cent, Reuters reported.

The rate shows the number of positive tests against the total tested and is an indicator of how quickly the virus spreads.

South Africa's government has attributed the surge in cases to the new strain, called 501.V2.

Currently, travellers with a recent travel history to South Africa are required to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities upon arrival in Singapore.

Those who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents are also required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure and present a valid COVID-19 test result as a condition of approval to enter Singapore.

Currently, travellers who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents and who have a recent travel history to high-risk countries or regions are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departure. They are then tested again at the end of their stay-home notice period.

In a media release, MOH noted the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the worsening coronavirus situation around the world.

""The multi-ministry task force regularly reviews Singapore’s border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers,"" said MOH.



""Given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases around the world, we will be putting in place more stringent measures for travellers to manage the risk of importation.""



FURTHER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM UK AND SOUTH AFRICA

The ministry also announced that all Singaporeans and permanent residents returning from the United Kingdom and South Africa will be subject to an additional seven days of self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day stay-home notice period at dedicated facilities.

This takes effect from 11.59pm on Jan 18.

They will be tested at the end of their stay-home notice, as with the current requirement, and again after they have completed their seven-day self-isolation period, said MOH.

These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their stay-home notice, and they will be in place until further notice.

Singapore authorities had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a recent travel history to the UK and South Africa, due to concerns of a more contagious variant of the coronavirus circulating in those countries.

INSURANCE COVERAGE

With effect from 11.59pm on Jan 31, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.

""The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers,"" said MOH.

Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the ATP and RGLs are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with the coronavirus or require treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.



""As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community,"" said MOH.

""The Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.""

Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated stay-home notice facilities, tests and treatment.

10,singapore,KL-Singapore High Speed Rail terminated after both countries fail to reach agreement on M'sia's proposed changes,"SINGAPORE - The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project has been terminated, after both countries failed to reach an agreement on changes proposed by Malaysia by the deadline of Dec 31.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Muhyiddin Yassin announced this in a joint statement on Friday (Jan 1) morning.

The statement said the Malaysian Government had proposed several changes to the HSR project in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Malaysian economy.

""Both Governments had conducted several discussions with regard to these changes and had not been able to reach an agreement. Therefore, the HSR Agreement had lapsed on 31 December 2020.""

The statement said both countries will abide by their respective obligations, and will now proceed with the necessary actions, resulting from the termination of the HSR Agreement.

Singapore's Ministry of Transport, in a separate statement, said Malaysia had allowed the HSR bilateral agreement to be terminated, and has to compensate Singapore for costs already incurred, in accordance with the agreement.

The joint statement added: ""Both countries remain committed to maintain good bilateral relations, and cooperate closely in various fields, including strengthening the connectivity between the two countries.""

PM Lee and Mr Muhyiddin had held talks on the twice-delayed bilateral project via video conference on Dec 2, after Malaysia earlier proposed some changes.

Both sides then said they would announce further details on the HSR Project through a joint statement in due course.

But the writing had been on the wall, following several Malaysian news reports that quoted unnamed sources saying the Malaysian Cabinet was planning to continue the project without Singapore's involvement and end the line in Johor.

11,singapore,16-year-old Singaporean detained under ISA for planning terrorist attacks on two mosques,"SINGAPORE - A 16-year-old Singaporean student has been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for planning to attack two mosques and kill worshippers in Singapore on March 15 this year - the second anniversary of the Christchurch terror attacks.

A Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, he is the first detainee to be influenced by far-right extremist ideology and the youngest person detained under the ISA for terrorism-related activities to date, said the Internal Security Department (ISD) on Wednesday (Jan 27).

The Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) student was found to have made detailed plans and preparations to conduct terrorist attacks using a machete against Muslims at two mosques here, the ISD said.

He had chosen Assyafaah Mosque in Sembawang - which he intended to attack first - and Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands as his targets because they were near his home, it added.

Influenced by the Christchurch attacker Brenton Tarrant, the youth had mapped out his route and bought a flak jacket. He intended to buy a machete on online marketplace Carousell and wanted to live-stream his planned massacre.

""He was self-radicalised, motivated by a strong antipathy towards Islam and a fascination with violence. He watched the live-streamed video of the terrorist attack on the two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and read the manifesto of the attacker, Brenton Tarrant,"" said the ISD.

He had also watched Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) propaganda videos, and came to the erroneous conclusion that ISIS represented Islam, and that Islam called on its followers to kill non-believers, said the ISD.

The ISD said it was clear from his attack plans and preparations that this youth was influenced by Tarrant's actions and manifesto.

First, he planned to carry out his attacks on the anniversary of the Christchurch attacks. He had conducted online reconnaissance and research on both mosques to prepare for the attack.

He also planned to drive between the two attack sites like Tarrant, and therefore devised a plan to procure a vehicle to use during the attack, said the ISD.

In response to media queries, an ISD spokesman said the lack of a driving licence did not deter the youth. ""He had viewed an online instructional video on driving and was confident he would be able to operate a vehicle,"" added the spokesman.

He had planned to use a BlueSG car and intended to steal his father's credit card to rent one.

He had watched videos on renting a BlueSG car and on operating an automatic transmission vehicle.","SINGAPORE - A 16-year-old Singaporean student has been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for planning to attack two mosques and kill worshippers in Singapore on March 15 this year - the second anniversary of the Christchurch terror attacks.
The Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) student was found to have made detailed plans and preparations to conduct terrorist attacks using a machete against Muslims at two mosques here, the ISD said.
Influenced by the Christchurch attacker Brenton Tarrant, the youth had mapped out his route and bought a flak jacket.

12,singapore,16-year-old Singaporean detained under ISA after planning to attack Muslims at 2 mosques,"The teen also explored making a triacetone triperoxide (TATP) bomb, and setting fire to the mosques using gasoline, mimicking Tarrant’s plan.

“He eventually dropped both ideas due to logistical and personal safety concerns,” ISD said.

The teen had also bought a tactical vest from Carousell last November, intending to embellish it with right-wing extremist symbols. He also wanted to modify it so he could strap on his mobile device to livestream the attack, just like Tarrant did, ISD said.

TEEN WANTED TO SPREAD HIS IDEALS

In further imitation of Tarrant, ISD said the teen had prepared two documents that he wanted to disseminate prior to his attacks.

The first was a message to the people of France, which he drafted after the attack against Christians in a church in Nice in October last year. In the message, he called on the French people to “stand up for what is right”, claiming that “we cannot let them (Muslims) lurk in our bushes and wait for them to attack”.

The second document, which ISD said was still unfinished when he was arrested, was a manifesto detailing his hatred for Islam and his belief that “violence should never be solved with peace”. The draft borrowed heavily from Tarrant’s manifesto and referred to the terrorist as a “saint”, ISD said.

ISD said the detailed planning and preparation attested to the teen’s determination to follow through with his attack plan.

“He admitted during the investigation that he could only foresee two outcomes to his plan – that he is arrested before he is able to carry out the attacks, or he executes the plan and is thereafter killed by the police,” ISD said.

Speaking to reporters, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said it was “quite chilling” to hear the teen saying this to ISD officers.

“He went in fully prepared, knowing that he is going to die, and he was prepared to die,” he added.

According to ISD, investigations so far indicate that the youth had acted alone, with no indication that he tried to influence anyone with his extreme outlook or involve others in his attack plans.

“His immediate family and others in his social circles were not aware of his attack plans and the depth of his hatred for Islam,” ISD said.

Notwithstanding his age, the teen knew what he was doing, ISD said, pointing out that the “specificity” of his plans showed they were not just “random musings”.

The agency added that it received intelligence last November about a Singapore-based individual who wanted to attack Muslims in Singapore. The teen was arrested under the ISA on Nov 26 and issued with a detention order on Dec 23.

“He was assessed to pose an imminent security threat,” ISD said.

The case is a “worrying development”, said Mr Shanmugam, pointing out that since 2015, seven people under the age of 20 have been detained or given restriction orders under the ISA.

Before this case, the youngest person detained under the ISA was a 17-year-old secondary school student who had shown support for ISIS.

HOW HE WAS SELF-RADICALISED

Explaining how the 16-year-old was self-radicalised, ISD said he had a fascination with violent materials, and frequented sites and forums specialising in gore.

In late 2019, he viewed ISIS propaganda videos while surfing for violent material, and was particularly angered by an ISIS video showing an execution of Ethiopian Christians.

The teen “erroneously concluded” that Islam taught followers to kill Christians, ISD said.

Around the same time, ISD said an online image of Tarrant’s rifle piqued his interest. He found Tarrant’s manifesto and livestreamed attack video, with the latter giving him a “rush”.

“The anti-Muslim aspect of ideology resonated with him,” ISD added.

But the turning point was on Oct 29 last year, when the attack in Nice happened. The teen was convinced that an attack by Muslims on Christians would happen “sooner or later”, ISD said. This was when he started detailed plans for his attacks.

If the attack had succeeded, Mr Shanmugam said it would have likely incited fear and conflict between different racial and religious groups.

“If a person on a day decides that he is going to attack mosques, or churches or temples, our gun control laws mean people like him can’t kill a lot of people at one go,” he said.

“But carrying a knife and deciding you want to do something? It’s not going to be easy to prevent every single time.”

INVESTIGATION AND REHABILITATION PROCESS

Before the teen was arrested, ISD said his mother was present during an interview, with an Appropriate Adult engaged during the investigation period.

The teen was also allowed family visits during the 30-day investigation period, which is typically prohibited during the first 30 days, ISD said.

When asked if the teen will be charged with any crime, Mr Shanmugam said ""a court process may not be the best way to deal with"" such individuals, pointing out that some Muslims arrested under the ISA have not been charged either.

""In his case, it would be said in a court of law, that he was only thinking about it. He has planned it, but he hasn’t actually taken a step yet. So, in many countries, without laws similar to the Internal Security Act, you can’t move early until there is some further act of preparation,"" he explained.

""When it involves Muslims attacking Christians or Christians attacking Muslims, my own view is that a court process inflames passions even more. And the approach we’ve taken – which has succeeded so far – first, it allows us through the Internal Security Act, to move in much faster, and prevent it and nip it in the bud.""

Given that the current rehabilitation approach is geared towards Islamist terrorism cases, ISD said the teen could require Christian religious counselling to correct misconceptions.

He will be given psychological counselling to address his propensity to violence and vulnerability to radical influences.

He will also be able to continue education while in detention, with mentoring to guide him on pro-social behaviour, ISD said.

""While in detention, he will undergo a holistic programme consisting of religious, psychological and social rehabilitation. A Christian religious counsellor will be engaged to help him correct the radical ideology he has imbibed,"" said an ISD spokesperson in further comments.

""He will be granted family visits and an aftercare officer will be assigned to his family to provide social and financial support if needed.""

Mr Shanmugam said the rehabilitation approach is ""constant regardless of whether you're Muslim or Christian"".

""Our hope is to have the religious leaders talk to this boy, and hopefully get him to understand that this is not what Christianity is about, and that he has been going on a path, which is inimical to society. We hope he will understand that,"" he said.

""Likewise the Muslims we pick up, we talk to the religious leaders and counselled them, that's why the religious rehabilitation group helps a lot. And many of them have understood, renounced violence and have gone back to society.""

For some detainees, Mr Shanmugam said it did not take very long for them to be rehabilitated, highlighting that some have been released after two or two-and-a-half years, or one period of detention.

""Some were very fixed in their views and continued to believe in violence, and it takes a longer period,"" he added. ""So, how long it takes depends on the individual involved and the framework.""

Mr Shanmugam said there’s a reasonable expectation, that he, like many other detainees, will eventually understand what their religion is about and be rehabilitated.

""So, the approach we have taken, offers a better path towards rehabilitation, as opposed to treating him like a criminal, charging him, and putting him in jail,"" he added.

""So here, with rehabilitation, my hope is that after a number of years, he can be released, and carry on with his life.""

ISD said the case demonstrates yet again that extreme ideas can find resonance among and radicalise Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion.

“It is a threat to all of us and our way of life. We must remain vigilant to signs that someone around us may have become radicalised, so that we can intervene early to avert a tragedy,"" it stated.","ISD said the detailed planning and preparation attested to the teen’s determination to follow through with his attack plan.

13,singapore,Singapore teenager arrested for plotting attack on Muslims,"The 16-year-old Protestant, arrested last month, was planning to attack two mosques on the anniversary of Christchurch massacre.

A teenager in Singapore has been detained under the country’s strict Internal Security Act (ISA) for plotting to kill Muslims in two mosques on the March 15 anniversary of the deadly 2019 Christchurch attacks, the government said on Wednesday.

The 16-year-old student, who is a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, is the youngest to be detained under such laws, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) said in a statement, adding that the teenager, who was inspired by “far-right extremist ideology”, was detained last month.

“A secondary school student at the time, he was found to have made detailed plans and preparations to conduct terrorist attacks using a machete against Muslims at two mosques in Singapore,” the ministry said.

The ISA law allows for detention without trial.

The teenager, who has not been identified, had mapped out his route and chosen Assyafaah Mosque and Yusof Ishak Mosque as his targets near his home in northern Singapore, the ministry said, adding that he also had the intention of live-streaming his planned attack.

“He was self-radicalised, motivated by a strong antipathy towards Islam and a fascination with violence.

“He had also watched Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) propaganda videos, and came to the erroneous conclusion that ISIS represented Islam, and that Islam called on its followers to kill non-believers,” the statement said referring to the ISIL group.

The ministry said the teen was clearly influenced by Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant who shot dead 51 Muslims attending Friday prayers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15, 2019. He had also streamed the shooting live on Facebook.

Tarrant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole last year in August.

The MOHA said in the statement that the teenager admitted during the investigation that he could only “foresee two outcomes to his plan – that he is arrested before he is able to carry out the attacks, or he executes the plan and is thereafter killed by the police”.

“He went in fully prepared, knowing that he is going to die, and he was prepared to die,” Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam was quoted as saying by local media.

In December, the International Security Department (ISA) said a 48-year-old Singaporean man was detained under the ISA for being “actively” involved in the civil war in Yemen.

“Sheik Heikel Khalid Bafana, who was in Yemen from 2008 to 2019, had volunteered to take up arms and also worked as a paid agent for a “foreign power” by collecting intelligence on Yemen,” ISD has told the local media.

Shanmugam pointed out that since 2015, seven people under the age of 20 have been detained or “given restriction orders under the ISA”.","The 16-year-old Protestant, arrested last month, was planning to attack two mosques on the anniversary of Christchurch massacre.

14,singapore,Singapore economy shrinks a record 5.8% in a pandemic-hit 2020,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s economy shrank a record 5.8 per cent in a pandemic-hit 2020, preliminary data showed on Monday (Jan 4), although most industries saw some improvement in the fourth quarter of the year as COVID-19 restrictions were eased.

This is Singapore's first annual contraction since 2001, and its worst recession since independence.

Singapore has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic amid movement restrictions and border closures, with construction, aviation and tourism among the most affected.

The Government had estimated that Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) would contract between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent in 2020.

GDP shrank 3.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the last three months of the year, an improvement from the 5.6 per cent drop in the third quarter, advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed on Monday (Jan 4).

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, Singapore’s GDP grew by 2.1 per cent in the final quarter of 2020, following the 9.5 per cent expansion between July and September.

Singapore entered a ""circuit breaker"" period in April to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, shutting down non-essential businesses.

It exited the circuit breaker period in June, gradually reopening the economy and is now in Phase 3. It has also started a vaccination programme, beginning with healthcare workers.

The Government has spent about S$100 billion on virus-related relief to support households and businesses. It expects Singapore to return to growth this year, but has cautioned that the recovery would be gradual.

HOW EACH SECTOR DID

Manufacturing continued to outperform, expanding 9.5 per per cent in the fourth quarter, and 7.1 per cent for the entire year.

Growth was mainly due to expansion in the electronics, biomedical and precision engineering clusters, which outweighed declines in the transport engineering and general manufacturing clusters, MTI said.

However, on a quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, it shrank by 2.6 per cent, after expanding by 12.6 per cent in the third quarter.

The services sector contracted by 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and 7.8 per cent for the whole year.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, it grew by 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, softening gains of 6 per cent it saw in the previous quarter.

Within the sector, the communications, finance, insurance and professional services cluster did better than trade-, hospitality- and administrative-related industries.

The construction sector was the worst performer, contracting 33.7 per cent for the full year. The building industry, however, appeared to be on the mend, with the contraction easing to -28.5 per cent in the last quarter from -46.2 per cent in the preceding quarter as more construction activities resumed.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the sector grew for the second quarter in a row by 34.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending the 39 per cent growth in the third quarter. ​​​​​​​","SINGAPORE: Singapore’s economy shrank a record 5.8 per cent in a pandemic-hit 2020, preliminary data showed on Monday (Jan 4), although most industries saw some improvement in the fourth quarter of the year as COVID-19 restrictions were eased.

“He will get a hearing within the rubric of the Internal Security Act and he would have a lawyer, and his position will be put across. His parents are fully involved,” Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told reporters on Thursday (Jan 28).



Mr Shanmugam said a judge will “look at it”. ""And I, as a minister, will have to look at it too,” he added.

The teen was influenced by Christchurch attacker Brenton Tarrant's actions and manifesto, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Wednesday.



Mr Shanmugam said on Thursday that the boy’s age was not relevant in considering whether or not he was going to be detained.



“Because I think we agree that he is capable of doing harm, and until he is rehabilitated, if we leave him out, and if he carries out what he intends to do, I think we will all be very sorry,"" he added.



The minister said the boy’s age will be a factor in deciding how his rehabilitation process should take place.



“I think given his age, there must be considerable hope that he can be rehabilitated,” he said, based on reports he received.



“But I don’t think there is any doubt in ISD’s mind that he ought to be detained for a period.”



The minister also reiterated the reasons why the teen will not be tried in court, pointing out that it will be argued that “he hasn’t done anything”.

16,singapore,Singapore will review Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine carefully before possible roll-out: Gan Kim Yong,"SINGAPORE - A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech will have to go through regulatory scrutiny and authorisation by Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) before it can be rolled out to the public, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday (Jan 13).

This update follows the release of data on a Brazilian trial on Tuesday, which showed that the Sinovac vaccine was just 50.4 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic infections. This barely meets the threshold for regulatory approval and is well below the rate announced last week.

The Sinovac vaccine has yet to be approved, Mr Gan told reporters on Wednesday, after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the only authorised one in Singapore.

""We will go through the data carefully when it comes, rather than depending on reported numbers. It's better to rely on official data that we receive from Sinovac itself,"" he said.

The HSA will assess the data when it is in, and the nation's Covid-19 expert committee will also evaluate if it is suitable for vaccination in Singapore, Mr Gan explained.

""We will share more details when it's available,"" he added.

Another vaccine candidate, developed by United States firm Moderna, has also submitted its data and is currently being reviewed by the HSA, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who also took his first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday.

""If and when the Moderna vaccine is authorised for use, then we will also use it for the vaccination programme,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs Singapore's Covid-19 multi-ministry task force with Mr Gan.

17,singapore,Singapore Airlines hopes to be world's first fully-vaccinated airline,"(CNN) — Singapore 's national carrier is hoping to become the world's first airline to get all of its crew members vaccinated against Covid-19.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) confirmed to CNN Travel that all of their crew members -- including pilots, gate agents, flight attendants and anyone whose job requires contact with the public -- have been offered free coronavirus vaccines by the Singaporean government.

The country has purchased the Pfizer vaccine , which requires two shots.

""We are grateful to the Singapore government for making the aviation sector a priority in the country's vaccination exercise,"" the airline's CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said in a statement that was emailed out to the whole company on January 18.

""This reflects the sector's importance, and the crucial role we play in both Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against the pandemic.""

According to the airline, 5,200 SIA employees have already signed up to get their shots. Inoculations will begin in a few days.

Phong, alongside Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung, was among the city-state's first citizens to get vaccinated. He has received the first of his two shots, and reports that ""the procedure was painless and fuss-free.""

Once vaccinated, crew members will be subject to less scrutiny and fewer coronavirus-related security measures. For example, flight crew who are currently tested on the seventh day after their return to Singapore will be exempt from this test going forward.

Singapore's response to the pandemic has been largely successful due to border closures and a national contract-tracing app. The country has had 59,113 confirmed cases of the virus and only 29 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Still, citizens of the city-state have expressed an interest in being able to travel again.

18,singapore,"Assets company removal 'main concern' that led to HSR termination, project has cost Singapore more than S$270 million: Ong Ye Kung","SINGAPORE: The ""main concern"" that led to the termination of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project was Malaysia's suggestion that the assets company that was to manage the project be removed, said Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung on Monday (Jan 4).



Speaking in the first Parliament session of the year, Mr Ong also revealed that Singapore had incurred more than S$270 million in costs for the project, which was first announced in 2013.

The revelations come after the prime ministers of both Malaysia and Singapore issued a joint statement on Jan 1 to say that the HSR would be discontinued after an agreement on the project lapsed on Dec 31.

The statement noted that the Malaysian government had proposed ""several changes"" to the project in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy.

Both governments had conducted several discussions on these changes and had not been able to reach an agreement, said Mr Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Muhyiddin Yassin.

A joint tender for an assets company for the HSR project was called by Malaysia's MyHSR and Singapore's SG HSR in December 2017.



The assets company would have been necessary to ensure the interests of both countries were protected and minimise the possibility of future disputes over the HSR, Mr Ong told Parliament.



He noted that neither Malaysia nor Singapore had experience in running a high-speed rail line and so it had been agreed that a ""best-in-class industry player"" would be appointed to act as an assets company through an ""open and transparent international tender"".

This company would have supplied the train system as well as operated the network, and would have been accountable to both countries.

The removal of the assets company represented a ""fundamental departure"" from the bilateral agreement and could not be accepted, said Mr Ong.

Malaysia then decided to allow the agreement to be terminated, he added.



He noted that while Malaysia is obligated to compensate Singapore for the termination of the project, the exact terms of the compensation cannot be revealed due to confidentiality agreements under the bilateral agreement.

The amount will include various abortive costs - such as for consultancy services, design of infrastructure, and manpower - but not land acquisition costs as the value of the land can be recovered, he said.

Singapore is also verifying a ""small component of miscellaneous abortive costs"" for the project's suspension requested by Malaysia, he added.

""Now that the HSR (bilateral agreement) has been terminated, Singapore is willing to discuss any new proposal on the KL-Singapore HSR from Malaysia in good faith, but starting from a clean slate,"" said Mr Ong.



IMPACT TO AVIATION HUB

Mr Ong was speaking in response to Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament Louis Chua, who had asked regarding the total expenditure incurred to date by Singapore on the HSR project as well as the terms specified in the bilateral agreement in relation to compensation upon termination of the agreement by either party.

Mr Ong also addressed Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong, noting that some media reports had suggested a proposal to connect the HSR to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport was a point of contention due to the possible impact to Singapore's aviation hub status.

Mr Ong said, however, that the main concern there would be technical issues as the HSR would have had to share tracks with the Express Rail Link, an existing rail system that runs at half the HSR's expected speed.

In fact, the heavy air traffic between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, which Mr Ong described as the busiest air link in the world with around 5 million passengers a year, pointed to the HSR project as being ""viable, mutually beneficial and strategic for the long term"".

In Parliament, Hougang MP Dennis Tan asked for the reasoning given by the Malaysian government on their change in position regarding the appointment of an assets company.

""I thank the Member for the question but I really cannot speak for the Malaysian government,"" said Mr Ong in response to the Workers' Party MP.

LITTLE IMPACT TO PLANS FOR JURONG

Responding to questions from West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng, the Transport Minister said there was little impact to plans for the Jurong Lake District, where the Singapore terminal for the HSR would have been located.

Plans to transform the area began in 2008 as part of efforts to build urban centres outside Singapore's central business district, well before the HSR project was first proposed in 2012 and before the decision was made to locate the terminal in Jurong in 2015.

""This will be the largest commercial and regional centre outside of our city centre, bringing many jobs, business and recreation opportunities for Singaporeans and Singapore companies,"" said Mr Ong.

The land parcels acquired by the Government would still be needed to realise these plans, he said, noting the former site of the Jurong Country Club would be used for new mixed use developments and community facilities while that of the Raffles Country Club would be used for the future Cross Island Line western depot and an integrated train testing centre.



Another cross-border rail project, the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link (RTS), was ""progressing well"" and Singapore will break ground for the project soon, said Mr Ong.

FILE PHOTO: A view of the city skyline in Singapore January 25, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su

Demand for Xiao’s skills has soared since he graduated in 2014 with a computer engineering degree but now he just ignores the offers, having recently joined TikTok owner Bytedance after several years with Southeast Asia’s Grab.

“It’s not like I want to change jobs frequently,” said Xiao.

Singapore is aiming to become a regional tech hub but faces a severe talent crunch as more firms move in, interviews with more than a dozen recruiters, companies and workers show.

China’s Tencent, Bytedance, U.S.-based Zoom Video Communications and unicorn Grab and Sea Ltd are among companies expanding in Singapore, fueling a war for tech talent in the city-state, where the jobless rate had reached a 16-year high due to a coronavirus-induced recession.

“Certain member companies have been expanding their operations ... and looking to hire more data scientists, more coders,” said Lei Hsien-Hsien, chief executive officer at the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore.

“So the demand is very strong but the supply is relatively weak, which then slows down some of the expansion plans.”

Up to 500 new tech vacancies are posted each week on job sites, according to NodeFlair, which is helping hire for Bytedance and Sea’s e-commerce business Shopee.

The information communications sector would need another 60,000 professionals over the next three years, cabinet minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in June.

In response to a Reuters query on the figure, the communications ministry said in mid-September there were nearly 10,000 tech-related job postings on a government-run careers portal and another 6,800 jobs and traineeships would be created by June 2021 through industry partnerships.

Border curbs due to the coronavirus and tighter foreign worker policies are delaying overseas hiring, exacerbating the shortage, some headhunters said. Some tech professionals can command pay increases of up to 30% when they switch jobs.

“It’s not sustainable,” said Daljit Sall at recruitment firm Randstad, who expects salaries to even out once borders reopen and as the talent pool develops.

The government has been re-training thousands of people with tech skills while the intake for IT courses at Singapore colleges has risen 17% over the past three years to about 7,600 for the 2020 academic year.

‘SMALL ISLAND’

Singapore, an Asian base for many multinationals and banks, has for years had a tight labour market and the country of 5.7 million people does not yet have the capacity to quickly match the tech skills and experience the industry needs.

“There are a lot of tech companies coming in and it’s a small island,” said Raagulan Pathy, head of enterprise Asia Pacific at Zoom, which plans to hire hundreds of engineers.

“The simple maths of it means that at a certain point you are going to run out of talent,” said Pathy, adding that Singapore’s programme for allocating visas for foreign workers was pragmatic.

For now, the labour crunch does not seem to be putting anyone off. The Economic Development Board (EDB) is getting healthy interest from global tech companies keen to expand operations, it said.

“We constantly seek to ensure companies who set up here have access to a strong Singaporean workforce complemented by a diverse foreign workforce,” said Managing Director Chng Kai Fong.

The EDB has various programmes to bridge the skills shortage including one that helps tech companies bring in talent from overseas and a new work visa for top-tier tech executives.

The work visa, launched this month, has prompted many enquiries, recruiters said. But it is limited to 500 participants and has strict criteria.

Companies are finding ways to cope. Shopping rewards platform ShopBack resorts to reallocating workload to its existing engineers to meet new demands.

Fintech firm Nium’s 250-strong engineering team is in India. Its 13-strong team of product managers is being doubled in Singapore, CEO Prajit Nanu said.

Singapore’s open economy was hit hard by the pandemic, airlines and tourism in particular, and former Singapore Airlines flight attendant Alloysius Lee is thankful he decided to study data analytics.

“I feel lucky ... I spent the past few years learning and picking up a new skill,” said Lee, 32.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At least three recruiters approach Singapore-based software engineer Xiao Yuguang every day with job offers.

20,singapore,World Economic Forum in Singapore postponed from May to Aug 17-20,"SINGAPORE - The World Economic Forum (WEF) has postponed its special annual meeting in Singapore from May to August, due to the global Covid-19 situation.

The meeting will now take place from Aug 17 to 20, the WEF said in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 3) night.

""Although the WEF and Government of Singapore remain confident of the measures in place to ensure a safe and effective meeting, and local transmission of Covid-19 in Singapore remains at negligible levels, the change to the meeting's timing reflects the international challenges in containing the pandemic,"" said the organisation.

It noted that current global travel restrictions have made planning for an in-person meeting in the first half of the year difficult.

23,singapore,Budget 2021: Expected deficit of $11b in 2021 with continued efforts to tide Singapore over Covid-19 crisis,"SINGAPORE - The Budget will continue to be expansionary for financial year 2021, with an expected deficit of $11 billion, or 2.2 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product.

This is as it continues to tide Singaporeans and businesses over the coronavirus pandemic with the $11 billion Covid-19 Resilience Package, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Feb 16).

Last year's expansionary Budget is expected to run Singapore's largest deficit since independence, with an overall deficit of $64.9 billion, or 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product.

""The deficit is driven by lower revenues due to dampened economic activity and the significant expenditures needed to mount a decisive response to Covid-19,"" said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister.

Measures rolled out in this year's Budget will help Singapore emerge stronger, by pressing on with economic and workforce transformation, strengthening social compact and building a sustainable future for its people, and will impart a considerable fiscal boost to the economy, he added.

Revenue and expenditure for 2021

Revenue for 2021 is projected to be $76.6 billion, which is $12 billion or 18.6 per cent more than the previous year's revised estimates.

This is largely due to higher corporate income taxes, goods and services taxes and other taxes such as foreign worker levies.

But this increase will also be moderated by lower personal income taxes.

Betting taxes are expected to go up by about 30 per cent to $2.4 billion.

Meanwhile, the ministries' expenditures are projected to come in around $102.3 billion, some $8.3 billion or 9 per cent higher than revised 2020 estimates.

This is largely due to larger spending on healthcare, transport and defence, which is partly offset by lower trade and industry spending as well as national development expenditures.

Transport spending will go up by $3 billion, or 37.8 per cent, with the resumption of construction activities and higher provisions for Covid-19 relief measures, especially for the hard-hit aviation sector, which will receive additional support and extended cost relief amounting to around $870 million.

In addition, healthcare spending will also go up, mainly to cater for the growth in patient subsidies with the opening of new facilities, ramping up of capacity ahead of the opening of the Woodlands Health Campus, and increasing demand for health and aged care services as Singapore's population ages.","SINGAPORE - The Budget will continue to be expansionary for financial year 2021, with an expected deficit of $11 billion, or 2.2 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product.

25,singapore,"The Big Read: Pummelled by COVID-19, Singapore's economy to begin K-shaped recovery with Budget 2021","NOT WASTING A CRISIS

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted Singapore’s economy, new opportunities have sprung up for companies in sectors such as healthcare, e-commerce and logistics.

And the Government has constantly reiterated the importance of seizing these opportunities to digitise and transform so that these companies are better placed for future growth.

Mr Ray Chou, country head of logistics company Ninja Van Singapore, said that the pandemic ""has made digital transformation imperative, for small businesses to operate and survive in this new reality"".

""While small businesses understand the benefits of these technologies, questions remain as to how they will pay for it and who will help implement the improvements,"" he said. ""Small and medium enterprises will definitely need assistance with the adoption and assimilation of new technologies and digital solutions.

""The impetus to continue business transformation would still feature strongly in Budget 2021,"" said Mr Seah, the DBS economist.

The crisis, in fact, has provided the Government with an opportunity to achieve its medium-term policy objective of getting companies to digitise their operations and hire more locals across the skills ladder through job redesign, with the number of foreign workers significantly down.

""The recovery phase provides a window to prompt a more lasting mindset shift in employers. The last thing you want is that when the economy recovers, all the companies and employers switch back to their old ways of doing things,"" he said.

The push for Singapore companies to regionalise and internationalise will remain intact in this year’s Budget as well, said Ms Ling.

The Grow Digital initiative and the Market Readiness Assistance grant are some examples that could be expanded or enhanced to build upon the momentum.

Another area that Singapore can capitalise on is to ensure that its economic recovery is taking place in a sustainable manner, or what some people call a ""green recovery"".

While initiatives to get companies and individuals to go green had been introduced in every Budget in the last few years, Budget 2020 marked the first time that climate change was featured prominently in the Government’s fiscal plans.

Earlier this month, Sustainability and the Environment Minister Grace Fu announced that a whole-of-nation movement - called the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - will be launched to advance the sustainability agenda, and its details will be unveiled in the coming weeks.

Ms Fu added that Mr Heng will speak more on the issue during the Budget debates.

And with empirical evidence showing that a slowdown in economic activities forced upon by the pandemic had produced better ecological outcomes, observers said that there is a heightened sense of urgency within the Government to ensure that sustainability and decarbonisation efforts not only continue but are carried out more forcefully.

So how would a green recovery look like?

""The goal is to turn a crisis into an opportunity by allocating government resources to areas that will stimulate growth, while also reducing environmental impact or at least stimulating investment and behaviour that will lead to a lower environmental footprint in the near future,"" said Assistant Professor Simon Schillebeeckx, who teaches strategic management at SMU.

He suggested, for example, reducing or eliminating investments in non-profitable sectors that are not sustainable, removing subsidies from sectors that would no longer be around in 20 years and equipping people and companies to digitise.

The crisis gives the Government a legitimate reason to slowly start the process of fading out industries with limited lifespan, he added.

Instead of investing money in emissions-based production such as the building of more roads or buildings, Mr Marc Allen, technical director at energy and climate change consultancy Engeco, suggested that investing in infrastructure for electric vehicles, or in renewable energy in neighbouring countries before importing it into Singapore, could be some options the Government could consider.

Another way is for the Government to decrease the costs and hurdles to get sustainable financing that are already provided by the banks, said Mr Allen.

In response to queries, DBS Bank said that it had concluded 50 sustainability financing deals amounting to about S$9.6 billion in 2020 - an 81 per cent increase of S$5.3 billion from the year before.

While demand for such loans has been growing steadily for the past couple of years, Ms Yulanda Chung, head of sustainability financing at DBS Bank, said that they saw unprecedented interest from borrowers in sustainable financing last year.

The borrowers not only come from conventional sectors such as real estate, which forms the majority of green loan issuances. Other sectors, such as food and agribusiness, conglomerates, energy, government-linked corporations and the automobile sector, have also taken up these loans, she added.

While OCBC Bank was unable to share figures, its head of structured finance and sustainable finance Mike Ng said that the momentum behind sustainable finance continued in 2020, with many deals coming from repeated customers.

The bank surpassed its previous target of achieving S$10 billion in sustainable financing in the first quarter of 2020, two years ahead of its original 2022 timeline. It has set a new target of hitting S$25 billion by 2025.

A spokesperson from United Overseas Bank said that the total value of sustainable financing the bank provided in 2020 was about four times that of the previous year.

All in all, with Singapore heading towards a recovery fraught with uncertainties, Budget 2021 is certainly one to watch, said the experts and observers.

It is likely to offer some pointers towards achieving longer-term objectives relating to economic transformation and sustainability, in a world irrevocably altered by the crisis of a generation.

""This is the litmus test for Budget 2021, if we are to not just build back but build back better and stronger. Sustainability in public spending will be very much on display and interrogated in Budget 2021.

""It will test the Government’s resourcefulness, ingenuity, and determination to have a Budget that will be fit for purpose and yet demonstrate fiscal prudence and sustainability,” said SMU’s Assoc Prof Tan.

26,singapore,"Singapore Airlines defers more than S$4 billion of spending on Airbus, Boeing planes","SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) said on Tuesday (Feb 9) that it would defer more than S$4 billion of spending on Airbus and Boeing planes after reaching agreements with the aircraft manufacturers to delay deliveries.



It will convert 14 of its Boeing 787-10 orders to 11 additional 777-9s to meet its fleet needs beyond the financial year ending in March 2026, the airline said in a statement.

""The agreements with Airbus and Boeing are a key plank of our strategy to navigate the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong said.

""They allow us to defer capital expenditure and recalibrate the rate at which we add capacity, aligning both with the projected recovery trajectory for international air travel,"" he said.

As a result of these agreements, some aircraft ordered by the SIA Group will be delivered over a longer period than initially contracted, the group said, with the delivery stream spread out beyond the immediate five years.

The airline will cut capital spending plans by S$2.2 billion in the 2020-21 financial year ending Mar 31, S$1.7 billion in 2021-22, and by a more limited amount in the following two years.



International travel is expected to take until 2024 to rebound to 2019 levels, according to industry estimates.

Singapore Airlines last week posted a S$142 million net loss in the third quarter as passenger numbers plunged by 97.6 per cent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though its cargo business held up better given a tight freight market.

The decision to switch some of its Boeing orders to 777-9s is a boost for the planemaker's poor-selling 777X programme, but adds pressure on the smaller 787, already hit by production problems.

Boeing last week said that 118 orders for its 777X wide-body plane under development are no longer seen as firm under accounting rules that require it to regularly assess their viability, leaving it with 191 solid orders for the model.

As of Tuesday, the revised SIA Group aircraft order book consists of 35 planes in the Airbus A320 family, 15 Airbus A350-900s, 31 Boeing 737-8s, 20 planes in the Boeing 787 family and 31 Boeing 777-9s.

27,singapore,"British man, Singaporean wife plead guilty after he breaches stay-home notice to meet her in hotel","SINGAPORE: A British national and his Singaporean wife pleaded guilty on Monday (Feb 15) to illegally spending time together during his stay-home notice at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia hotel.

Under COVID-19 regulations, Nigel Skea, 52, was required to stay in his hotel room for 14 days. He breached the rules three times and on the third departure, met his then-fiancee Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai in a different room in the same hotel.

On Sep 21 last year, he left his room without a mask on three occasions. According to court documents, he loitered along the corridor outside his room on the 14th floor twice, for about 10 minutes each time.

On the third occasion, he met Eyamalai, 39. She was not serving a stay-home notice but had booked a different room on the 27th floor of the same hotel.

The pair met on the 27th floor, with Eyamalai opening an emergency exit door for Skea. They then spent the night together in the room from about 2.30am to 11.40am. Skea eventually tested negative for COVID-19.

They were charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 – Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 last month.



The prosecution proposed that Skea be jailed for four weeks and fined S$1,000, and for Eyamalai to be jailed for two weeks.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Kee said that Skea had ""clearly premeditated"" the offences, as he had scouted a viable route to get to Eyamalai's hotel room, and also used a cardboard stopper to leave his hotel room ajar so he could return. He would otherwise have been locked out.

He managed to get to Eyamalai's room with her help when she opened a one-way door at an emergency staircase.

When he tried to return to his room, he was unable to do so and needed help from hotel staff members. He lied that he became stuck after his room door closed accidentally behind him as he was trying to collect the food left outside his room, the court heard.

Mr Kee said that the duration the couple spent together was ""quite significant"".

In mitigation, defence lawyer for both Skea and Eyamalai S S Dhillon said that Skea's primary reason for coming to Singapore was to marry his fiancee. They got married on Nov 14 last year.

""This is a classic case of two lovers wanting to be together,"" he said, adding that they made their mistake because of their ""emotionally vulnerable state"".

Mr Dhillon said Eyamalai did a ""foolish"" thing because of love and the long separation from Skea.

""She couldn't wait to see him once he had arrived in Singapore,"" he said.

""This love element, long separation, couldn't make them wait any longer to see each other.""

There was ""minimal contact"" with any other person, which should be taken into account for sentencing, Mr Dhillon said.



In response, Mr Kee said the couple only had to wait for 14 days.

The case is expected to return to court on Feb 26. Skea and Eyamalai could be fined up to S$10,000 and be jailed for up to six months for each offence.

28,singapore,"Jail for British man, Singaporean wife who met in hotel where he was serving stay-home notice","SINGAPORE: A British man and his Singaporean wife were jailed on Friday (Feb 26) for conspiring to breach a stay-home notice so that they could spend time together in a hotel room.

Nigel Skea, 52, was sentenced to two weeks' jail and fined S$1,000. Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, 39, was given a week's jail.

Skea had conspired with Eyamalai, his then-fiancee, to meet in a room at a hotel where he was serving a stay-home notice after arriving in Singapore from London.

District Judge Jasvender Kaur said it was not harsh for her not to place mitigating weight on the explanation for their breach – that Skea had travelled to propose marriage and they both were overcome by emotions after not seeing each other for a very long time.

""The fact of the matter is that the restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of the pandemic,"" she said. ""Disruptions to relationships are an inevitable consequence. It requires patience and sacrifice (from) everyone ... for the greater good.""

Prosecutors had called for four weeks' jail and a S$1,000 fine for Skea, who was working as a tug master in the boat industry and had been deployed overseas for his work. They sought two weeks' jail for Eyamalai.

The pair pleaded guilty earlier this month. Skea admitted to two charges of exposing others to risk of infection by leaving his hotel room while on stay-home notice and failing to wear a mask. Another four charges were taken into consideration.

Eyamalai, who subsequently married Skea, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring with Skea to breach his stay-home notice.

Skea had arrived in Singapore from London on Sep 20, 2020, and was given a stay-home notice which he was to serve in a room at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia hotel. He was told that he could not leave his room nor have any visitors and acknowledged these requirements.

However, he sent a text message to Eyamalai to tell her he had arrived at the hotel and they agreed to meet each other. Eyamalai booked a room at the same hotel and checked in.

At 12.52am on Sep 21, 2020, Skea left his hotel room without wearing a mask to scout the premises and find a viable route to get to Eyamalai's room.

However, he got locked out at an emergency staircase and called the hotel's reception counter for aid. At about 1am, a hotel employee went to Skea's room and helped him to unlock it, noticing that he was not wearing a mask.

Skea left his room again at 2.22am after a phone call from Eyamalai. He propped open his door with a piece of cardboard before walking up the stairs from the 14th floor to the 27th floor where Eyamalai was waiting.

They spent the night together in Eyamalai's room. Skea left her room at 11.13am and tried to return to his own room, but was stopped by a security officer.

He lied that he had become stuck when his room door closed accidentally behind him while he was trying to collect food left outside. However, his lie was uncovered when his door was found ajar.

The couple's defence lawyer S S Dhillon said in mitigation that Skea had come to Singapore primarily to marry his fiancee. They did so on Nov 14 last year.

The lawyer called it ""a classic case of two lovers wanting to be together"".

29,singapore,Singapore passes bill governing police use of contact tracing data,"Singapore passes Bill governing police use of contact tracing data Watch Now

Singapore has passed new legislation detailing the scope of local law enforcement's access to COVID-19 contact tracing data. It does so amidst questions whether the bill offers sufficient clarity and if police access should be excluded in the interest of public health.

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Bill was debated, and eventually passed, in parliament Tuesday under a Certificate of Urgency, which allows the government to more swiftly introduce new legislation deemed urgent. The move comes weeks after it was revealed the police could access the country's TraceTogether contact tracing data for criminal investigations, contradicting previous assertions that this information would only be used when the individual tested positive for the coronavirus.

It sparked a public outcry and prompted the government to announce plans for a new bill that would limit police access to seven categories of ""serious offences"", during which contact tracing data could be used for criminal probes, inquiries, or court proceedings. These included cases involving terrorism, use or possession of dangerous weapons, kidnapping, and serious sexual offences.

Singapore must return data control to users to regain public trust Trust plays an important role in consumers' willingness to share their personal data, but trust will erode if businesses continue to be given wider access to personal data and Singaporeans do not feel empowered to safeguard their own cyber hygiene. Read More

The new legislation also encompasses data collected through other digital contact tracing apps, such as location visitor log SafeEntry and BluePass tokens, which are issued to migrant and local workers living or working in dormitories as well as those in construction, marine shipyard, and process sectors. BluePass data is interoperable with the TraceTogether platform.

Introduced last March, TraceTogether taps Bluetooth signals to detect other participating mobile devices -- within 2 metres of each other for more than 30 minutes -- to allow them to identify those who have been in close contact when needed. Data collected is encrypted and stored for 25 days, before it is automatically deleted from the app or token.

There currently are more than 4.2 million TraceTogether users, or about 80% of the local population.

The new bill does not cover aggregated or anonymised data and supersedes existing laws. Public officers or contractors engaged by government agencies who are found guilty of unauthorised use or disclosure of contact tracing data face fines of up to SG$20,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.

TraceTogether and SafeEntry systems would cease once the pandemic is declared over -- a timeframe that must be specified by the government. Public sector agencies then must stop collecting such data and remove collected personal contact tracing data ""as soon as practicable"".

This means the police can no longer access data unless it has been previously retained and used in criminal investigations and court proceedings.

In debating the bill during parliament Tuesday, members raised questions on whether details laid out were overly vague and whether it was necessary in the first place to provide police access at the risk of public health.

Calls to limit TraceTogether to original contact tracing purpose

Lead of the opposition Workers' Party, Pitram Singh, noted that the missteps leading up to the revelation that police could access TraceTogether data had bred scepticism and eroded public trust. The perceived lack of empathy towards personal privacy on the government's part had prompted some to circumvent the app's tracing ability, such as turning off Bluetooth after checking into a location, he said.

Singh said the Workers' Party believed anything that compromised the use of TraceTogether should take a backseat and its use should be limited to contact tracing, which also then would align with the government's original assurance.

""I am of the view that such an approach would also engender greater confidence, given that a public conversation on privacy has hitherto not been ventilated in a significant way in Singapore,"" he said.

Contact tracing apps unsafe if Bluetooth vulnerabilities not fixed With governments increasingly looking to use contact tracing apps to help contain COVID-19, such initiatives are likely to spark renewed interest in Bluetooth attacks which means there is a need for assurance that these apps are regularly tested and vulnerabilities patched.

The police, too, already had an abundance of tools that was sufficient to aid in their criminal investigations, including access to CCTVs, forensic examinations of mobile phones, and old-fashion police work such as the use of informants and collecting physical evidence.

That said, however, he said the opposition party would lend its support to the bill since Singaporeans' right to privacy could be better protected with it, rather than without.

Singh's colleague Sylvia Lim, who is also a Member of Parliament, called for further clarifications to be made regarding the definition of the seven categories of serious offences, which she said were broad and could lead to ambiguity in their application. She suggested that specific examples of what could constitute, or not, as serious offences under these categories would provide a clearer guideline.

In further supporting her party's stance that TraceTogether should exclude police access, Lim noted that the Australian government was amongst countries that had opted to prohibit such access to contact tracing data.

Singh also asked if the government could detect if an individual had deactivated Bluetooth upon gaining entry to a venue and whether such circumvention indicated a need for the government to review the effectiveness of TraceTogether and, hence, use by the police.

Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative and Foreign Affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, some 58% of individuals used the contact tracing app at least once daily and this figure had remained largely the same even after it was revealed police had access to the data.

There were, however, no details on how many turned off the app or Bluetooth connectivity because the platform was designed specifically with privacy concerns in mind, he said.

Balakrishnan explained that the app, when activated, would query a central server to determine if the individual had been in the same vicinity and at the same time as a COVID-19 patient. If there was such an overlap, an alert would be pushed to the individual so they would know to monitor their health for any potential symptoms. They would be contacted directly by health officials if they were a close contact.

He acknowledged that some individuals were ""gaming"" the contact tracing system and urged them against doing so in order to better protect themselves against the pandemic.

According to the minister, 350 people had requested their TraceTogether data to be deleted from the central server over the past month.

He stressed that TraceTogether, by design, was created for contact tracing purposes and not intended for police use. Data collected was stored locally on the user's device or token and uploaded to the central server only when the user entered a pin, which would be provided if they were identified as a close contact, or when the token was physically handed over to health authorities.

""GovTech took great pains to create an app that was fundamentally privacy-protecting at its core, by design,"" the minister said, adding that the platform collected only proximity data and did not capture GPS or movement data. The token also did not have cellular connectivity. ""These were conscious design decisions made at conception.""

Based on these considerations, he said it would be reasonable to argue that for most cases, TraceTogether data would not prove very useful for police use. However, law enforcers also should not be unnecessarily hindered in investing any possible leads that could help in their criminal investigations, he added.

Noting that the new bill was not established to set a precedence, Balakrishnan said the government had taken ""this exceptional step"" to encourage public participation of TraceTogether whilst maintaining public confidence in the contact tracing programme.

30,singapore,Singapore-Australia travel bubble might just work,"SINGAPORE - Come July, Singapore and Australia could become the first countries to use ""Covid-19 vaccine passports"" for travel within a ""bubble"" of these two nations.

However, as the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday (March 15), everything is at a very preliminary and exploratory stage at present. Australians are already allowed to transit via Singapore without quarantine, provided they comply with Singapore's safety protocols.

It is now up to the two governments and their relevant agencies to hammer out the details.

Mr Alexandre de Juniac, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), noted recently that global air travel will begin to recover from the middle of the year, though actual travel volume could be low compared with the pre-Covid-19 period in 2019.

A lot of this presupposes a global Covid-19 vaccination roll-out that gathers pace over the coming year. It also presupposes the widespread acceptance of these vaccine passports by countries across the world.

Iata is already working with states to design protocols and road maps for reopening borders. Key among these protocols is Iata's Travel Pass, a mobile health verification app that electronically captures the traveller's vaccination history and Covid-19 test results for cross-border safety checks.

Singapore Airlines has announced that it will begin testing the Iata Travel Pass on flights from Singapore to London.

Beginning this week, passengers on that route using Apple iOS-enabled phones will be able to download the Travel Pass app and create a digital identification with their photo and passport information. They can also submit flight information and book a Covid-19 test at one of seven participating clinics in Singapore, after which their test results can be viewed directly on the app.

Check-in staff at Changi Airport can then verify the travellers' status via the app, which will speed up the check-in process, according to the carrier.

But due to current regulations, travellers will still need to carry a physical copy of their health certificate issued by the testing clinics. China has announced its own Covid-19 passport system, while Germany and the United States are poised to come on board the Travel Pass initiative.

But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.

This is not the first time Singapore has moved forward with the idea of a travel bubble. Earlier, its attempt to set up something similar with Hong Kong failed after Covid-19 cases in the Chinese territory surged.

But the Singapore-Australia deal might just work, and here's why.

First, both countries have low rates of infection in the single digits.

Second, both countries have critical stakes in opening up their economies to each other.

Singapore has a large expatriate Australian population that has been shut out of its home country for over a year. In addition, international travel for education, business and tourism contributed A$45 billion (S$46.8 billion) a year to the Australian economy before the pandemic hit and, last week, Universities Australia said that the decrease in international students had cost an estimated 17,300 jobs and A$1.8 billion in revenue.","SINGAPORE - Come July, Singapore and Australia could become the first countries to use ""Covid-19 vaccine passports"" for travel within a ""bubble"" of these two nations.

31,singapore,"About 580,000 Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer and PPS members affected by data security breach","SINGAPORE: About 580,000 KrisFlyer and PPS members have been affected by a data security breach, Singapore Airlines (SIA) said on Thursday (Mar 4).



The data breach involves the passenger service system servers of SITA, an air transport information technology company.



“While SIA is not a customer of the SITA PSS, this breach of the SITA PSS server has affected some KrisFlyer and PPS members,” said the national carrier.



All Star Alliance member airlines provide a restricted set of frequent flyer programme data to the alliance, which is then sent on to other member airlines to reside in their respective passenger service systems.



SIA said this data transfer is necessary to enable verification of the membership tier status, and to accord to member airlines’ customers the relevant benefits while travelling.



One of the Star Alliance member airlines is a SITA PSS customer. As a result, SITA has access to the restricted set of frequent flyer programme data for all 26 Star Alliance member airlines including Singapore Airlines.







“The information involved is limited to the membership number and tier status and, in some cases, membership name, as this is the full extent of the frequent flyer data that Singapore Airlines shares with other Star Alliance member airlines for this data transfer,” said SIA.



SIA added that this data breach specifically does not involve KrisFlyer and PPS member passwords, credit card information and other customer data such as itineraries, reservations, ticketing, passport numbers and email addresses.



Such information is not shared with other Star Alliance member airlines for this data transfer, said the airline.



SIA said none of its IT systems have been affected by the breach and that they are reaching out to all KrisFlyer and PPS members to inform them about the incident.



“The protection of our customers’ personal data is of utmost importance to Singapore Airlines, and we sincerely regret the incident and apologise for the inconvenience caused.”



""HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ATTACK""

SITA confirmed in a separate statement that it was the “victim of a cyber-attack” which led to the data security incident.



After confirming the seriousness of the incident on Feb 24, SITA said it took immediate action to contact the affected SITA passenger service system customers and all related organisations.



“We recognise that the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about security threats, and, at the same time, cyber-criminals have become more sophisticated and active. This was a highly sophisticated attack,” it said.



SITA added that the matter remains under continued investigation by its security incident response team with the support of “leading external experts in cyber-security”.","SINGAPORE: About 580,000 KrisFlyer and PPS members have been affected by a data security breach, Singapore Airlines (SIA) said on Thursday (Mar 4).

32,singapore,Singapore Exchange may allow listing of SPACs but with restrictions,"SINGAPORE: Singapore Exchange (SGX) is proposing introducing regulations to allow the listing of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) or blank cheque firms that have taken US markets by storm.

""The feedback we have been receiving is that an Asian SPAC would be interesting because Asia is such a fertile ground not just for target companies but also for sponsors,"" Tan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange Regulation, told a news conference.

SGX, the first major Asian bourse to consider the listing of SPACs, is calling for market feedback from Wednesday (Mar 31) until April 28 after which it could introduce regulations by mid-year.

SPACs or shell companies, raise funds via IPOs to merge with operating firms and then take them public after offering them shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations.

SGX is proposing safeguards to rein in risks seen in US SPACs such as excessive dilution by shareholders and sponsors and a rush by shell firms to merge with targets. SGX plans a minimum S$300 million (US$223 million) market value for SPACs.

Hong Kong, Indonesia and other markets are stepping up efforts for SPAC listings but some industry executives say the region may not be as attractive as the United States where SPACs have already raised US$97 billion this year after a bumper 2020.

""It's clear that the SGX is targeting high-quality institutional investors even though this makes it a smaller market,"" said one banker who did not want to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""The safeguards might not be a deal-breaker for many sponsors but then again Singapore really needs to roll out the red carpet to win over SPACs,"" he said.

SPACs usually offer shares with warrants attached, which entitle them to buy shares at a certain price, becoming valuable if the underlying stock price goes up.

Unlike the United States, SGX proposes that warrants cannot be detached from underlying shares, and that only those investors who vote against a business combination be allowed to redeem shares. This would help prevent what is known as free-riding, Tan said.

""Our observations showed that the SPACs that were most successful were the ones which managed two main risks well: first, free-riding by investors and excessive dilution of long-term investors, and second: the rush to do a business combination also known as a de-SPAC,"" Tan said.

In US SPACs, the shares and warrants may be traded separately, meaning investors can sell their shares but still benefit via the warrants if the SPAC is successful but without contributing capital to the company.

Other measures by SGX include a minimum equity participation by founding shareholders and allowing SPAC mergers to be completed within three years instead of the typical two years seen in US SPACs.","SINGAPORE: Singapore Exchange (SGX) is proposing introducing regulations to allow the listing of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) or blank cheque firms that have taken US markets by storm.

33,singapore,Myanmar maid is Singapore's first COVID-19 community case in 2 weeks; developed symptoms the day she started work,"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported one locally transmitted COVID-19 case as of noon on Friday (Mar 26), the first of such infections in two weeks.



The community case was among 12 new infections. The remaining cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

No new cases were reported in migrant workers' dormitories.



The sole community case is a 26-year-old woman from Myanmar who is a foreign domestic worker.

The woman, known as Case 61184, arrived from Myanmar on Jan 23 and served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Feb 6.

MOH said her test taken on Feb 5 during stay-home notice was negative for COVID-19.

Following her stay-home notice, she moved into a boarding house for foreign domestic workers while waiting for deployment to an employer, and had not left the boarding house from Feb 6 to Mar 23, said the health ministry.

On Mar 23, she started work at her employer's residence. On the same night, she developed a cough and runny nose. She sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Mar 24 and was tested for COVID-19.

Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day and she was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an ambulance.

Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on Mar 25 was negative for COVID-19 and her serological test result has come back as positive.

""She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude that she had been infected before her arrival in Singapore, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure,"" said MOH.



Epidemiological investigations are ongoing and all identified close contacts of the case, including those at the boarding house and employer's residence, have been isolated and quarantined. They will be tested for COVID-19 at the start and end of their quarantine period.



Serological tests will also be done for close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.



TWO LOCATIONS IN TAMPINES IDENTIFIED

The health ministry also added two locations in Tampines to its list of places visited by COVID-19 cases in the community during their infectious period.

The Tampines branch of Nation, an agency for foreign domestic workers, was visited on Mar 23 and Mar 25. It is located at 201E Tampines Street 23.

This batch of workers have never been infected by COVID-19, said the ministry, adding that their vaccinations will be conducted at the five dormitories.

Workers who have been fully vaccinated can be subjected to a lower frequency of testing that is conducted every 28 days instead of the current 14-day cycle.



Vaccinations will progressively be made available to other migrant workers, said MOH.



Migrant workers living in dormitories made up about 90 per cent of Singapore's COVID-19 tally. Infections among this group have fallen over the past few months, with no cases reported on most days.

In a media release, MOH said migrant worker dormitories are where large COVID-19 clusters could ""rapidly develop and grow, with a high risk of transmission to the local community"".

""Vaccination of migrant workers living in dormitories is thus part of our national COVID-19 vaccination strategy to protect all Singaporeans and long-term residents,"" it added.



Giving an update on Singapore's vaccination programme, the ministry said about 379,000 people have received their first dose of the vaccine as of Sunday. Of these, more than 217,000 have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regime.

It also announced that vaccinations will be offered to more workers involved in other critical functions, such as postmen and delivery staff members, news reporters, bank employees in critical banking and financial systems operations.

Teachers and school employees are also set to get their jabs from Wednesday.

Later this month, vaccinations will be offered to selected cargo drivers and accompanying personnel who enter Singapore from Malaysia on a regular basis.

China's dual circulation strategy is aimed at spurring domestic consumption and self-reliance while at the same time encouraging foreign investment and catering to export markets.

As a key regional financial hub, Singapore is also able to support China's opening up of its financial and capital markets, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan in an interview with Chinese official news agency Xinhua ahead of his visit to Wuyishan in Fujian province in south-eastern China.

Singapore has been China's largest foreign investor over the past seven years, and Singapore companies can continue to tap the large Chinese market in areas where its expertise best matches the needs of China's domestic economy, said Dr Balakrishnan in the interview published on Tuesday (March 30).

The Singapore Foreign Minister will meet and be hosted to a meal by his Chinese counterpart, Mr Wang Yi, on Wednesday.

""We are well positioned to serve as a gateway for Chinese investors to access Asean markets and opportunities, as well as a key node to channel investments into China from the rest of the world,"" he said, adding that a quarter of all Chinese outward investments to Belt and Road countries flowed through Singapore.

Despite the pandemic, China and Asean have also continued their economic cooperation and are working on upgrading their free trade agreement so that it ""remains 'fit for purpose' in a post-pandemic world"", said Dr Balakrishnan.

Chinese data shows that Asean has become its largest trading partner last year.

The updated FTA will include new priorities stemming from the Covid outbreak, such as the digital economy, public health and the reduction of non-tariff measures, he said.

Asean also signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) last November with China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, a trade bloc that is the biggest in the world, accounting for 30 per cent of global GDP.

""When RCEP comes into force, it will send a strong signal that our region remains committed to free and open trade. At the same time, the door remains open for other like-minded partners to join us,"" he said.

Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Wang are expected to pick up from last December's Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation meeting and discuss progress on the agreements made.

36,singapore,Singapore and Taiwan in talks about possible travel bubble: Reports,"Singapore and Taiwan are in talks about a possible travel bubble, Taiwan’s Health Minister Chen Shih-chung reportedly said on Thursday (Mar 18).



Singapore relaxed restrictions on arrivals from Taiwan in December, allowing travellers from the island to go about their activities without serving a stay-home notice if they test negative for COVID-19 upon arrival.



Since then, Singaporean authorities have pushed for a reciprocal policy in Taiwan, Mr Chen was reported as saying by Focus Taiwan.



The two sides are in discussions but no formal proposal has been made yet, several Taiwanese media outlets reported.



Taiwan News reported on Thursday that Taiwan’s transport minister Lin Chia-lung said the island is discussing travel bubbles with several countries, including Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.



The Pacific nation of Palau announced an air travel bubble with Taiwan earlier this week, with the travel bubble set to kick off on Apr 1. Palau has not recorded a single case of COVID-19, while Taiwan has reported 990 cases and 10 deaths.

TAIWAN A ""VERY SAFE PARTNER""

In an interview with CNA in December, Singapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said Taiwan is a ""very safe partner to do a unilateral opening"" with.



He also noted that Taiwan had unilaterally reduced the quarantine period for essential business travellers from Singapore to five days.



""That is the most relaxed rule they have imposed on any traveller and which they accorded Singapore as the lowest risk country,"" said Mr Ong then.



""So with this unilateral opening, I think it's not bad. As a business traveller, you can go to Taiwan with five days quarantine. And then when you return with a test, there's no need for SHN (stay-home notice). So it's possible, hopefully we'll get a bit more to and fro between the two places.""

38,singapore,"Not possible for S'pore, many countries, to choose between US and China, PM Lee tells BBC","SINGAPORE - It will not be possible for Singapore to choose between the United States and China, given the extensive ties the Republic has with both superpowers, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (March 14).

Many other countries are in a similar situation, he added during an interview with the BBC, saying they would be hard pressed if forced to pick a side.

""I hope the time does not come,"" he said when asked which one Singapore will choose when the time comes.

""I do not think this is a dilemma only for Singapore. It is a problem for many countries, which is why we are all hoping and encouraging the two large powers to think very carefully before deciding that the other one is an adversary which has to be kept down, if not put down.""

The past few years have seen a significant deterioration in ties between the US and China, with their rivalry set to continue in spite of the change in administration in Washington.

With both sides exerting their influence on allies and partners, it has become harder for countries to stay in the middle. The administration of US President Joe Biden, for instance, has called for a review of how the country buys strategic goods, saying that it will work with like-minded countries.

Asked if it is realistic to sit on the fence in light of these developments, Mr Lee said: ""I do not think we are the only ones in this boat.""

He cited the European Union, which had signed an investment agreement with China before Mr Biden took office.

He also said that for Singapore, having kerfuffles from time to time, with either China or America, cannot be helped.

""Between countries, this happens. It does not mean we are your opponents, but it does mean that we have problems which need to be worked through, and meanwhile (there are) other areas where we can continue to work together. That is how we do it,"" he added.

Reiterating Singapore's position of assessing and making a judgment as to which course of action is in its best interests, Mr Lee said: ""Generally, it is that we want to be friends with both, but we have to find our own way forward.""

He also noted that competition and tension between both superpowers is inevitable in the Asia-Pacific region. But he emphasised that they have to coexist.

""These are two very major powers, neither of whom is going to be able to put the other one away, and neither of whom is going to curl up and die,"" he said.

Unlike the former Soviet Union which had an unsustainable economy and was pushed to the brink during the Cold War, China's economy has a lot of resilience, tremendous energy and creativity, and people who are on the move and are making great progress, he added.

The US, too, may have serious political schisms and problems, but has got tremendous vitality and attraction for people around the world, he added.","""I hope the time does not come,"" he said when asked which one Singapore will choose when the time comes.

Singapore will next month accept visitors who use a mobile travel pass containing digital certificates for Covid-19 tests and vaccines, its aviation regulator said on Monday, becoming one of the first countries to adopt the initiative.

Singapore will accept the International Air Transport Association (IATA) mobile travel pass for pre-departure checks, where travelers can get clearance to fly to and enter Singapore by showing a smartphone application containing their data from accredited laboratories.

The pass was successfully tested by Singapore Airlines. More than 20 carriers, including Emirates, Qatar Airways and Malaysia Airlines, are also testing the pass.

42,singapore,Travellers flying to Singapore can use IATA travel pass from May,"SINGAPORE: Passengers travelling to Singapore by air will be able to use the International Air Transport Association (IATA) travel pass from May 1, as part of an ongoing collaboration between the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and IATA.

Passengers will be able to share their pre-departure COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results with their airline during check-in and on-arrival at the immigration checkpoints at Changi Airport, said CAAS and IATA on Monday (Apr 5).

""This is part of an ongoing collaboration between CAAS and IATA to facilitate seamless and efficient travel through digital certificates of COVID-19 tests,"" they said.

The IATA travel pass is a mobile app that can be used by passengers to obtain and store their COVID-19 test results from accredited laboratories.

Last month, Singapore Airlines (SIA) tested IATA's travel pass on passengers travelling from Singapore to London between Mar 15 and Mar 28. The airline said the app was well received by their customers and noted that they were open to using the app for international travel in the future.



Following SIA's trials, CAAS and IATA said Singapore's health and border control authorities will accept the travel pass as a valid form of presentation of COVID-19 pre-departure tests for entry into the country.

""The information presented on the IATA travel pass will be in a format that satisfies Singapore’s prevailing COVID-19 pre-departure test requirements for entry into Singapore,"" said the authorities, adding that they will be working on further enhancements to the travel pass.



This includes enabling QR code scanning by immigration officers. Back-end transmission of health credentials from the travel pass to the airlines and immigration authorities' systems for pre-boarding and pre-arrival clearance will be included, as well as including digital vaccination certificates on the travel pass.

CAAS director-general Kevin Shum said the collaboration with IATA demonstrates the ""shared commitment to drive the adoption of digital health certificates and restore international air travel"".

""As we work to safely rebuild the Changi air hub, we will continue to explore other solutions that can provide similarly secure and verifiable means of sharing health certificates for safe international travel,"" said Mr Shum.

The travel pass will be available for download in the second half of April and is currently being trialled by more than 20 airlines, including SIA.

Those who are travelling to Singapore and intend to use the travel pass should check with the airline they are travelling with for eligibility to use the travel pass, said CAAS and IATA.

CHANGI AIRPORT LAUNCHES NEW ONLINE CONCIERGE SERVICE FOR TRAVELLERS

On Monday, Changi Airport Group (CAG) launched a new online concierge service for travellers planning to travel to Singapore by air.

The new Safe Travel Concierge service lets passengers book their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test and check that they have completed all pre-travel requirements for entry into Singapore, said CAG.

""Instead of searching different websites to apply for their pre-travel documents, passengers can easily access the information and forms through STC,"" it said.

Passengers can simply add their upcoming trips after registering for a Safe Travel Concierge account. Depending on their profile and trip details, they will be shown a customised list of pre-travel requirements to complete before flying to Singapore.



Besides booking their on-arrival PCR tests, they can also access services such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's electronic arrival card and health declaration form through the online concierge.



Registration for an account is free and passengers can register for one on safetravel.changiairport.com.

43,singapore,"Over 120,000 have taken cruises to nowhere as Royal Caribbean, Genting extend cruise season","SINGAPORE - More than 120,000 people have set sail on cruises, with no Covid-19 cases on board since a pilot programme to reboot the cruise industry began last November, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).

Noting that the cruise pilot was launched to regain the confidence of passengers, STB's director of cruise Annie Chang told The Straits Times the two cruise operators on the pilot have ""demonstrated the ability to put in place stringent protocols and precautionary measures"".

Other cruise lines have expressed interest in joining the pilot programme, noted Ms Chang.

""We will continue to monitor the results of the pilot before deciding on the next steps,"" she added.

On Thursday (April 1), Royal Caribbean International announced it was extending its Quantum of the Seas cruises until October this year, after the cruise company saw an overwhelming demand for travel.

Genting Cruise Lines, the other operator participating in the pilot, also told The Straits Times that Dream Cruises will be extending its World Dream sailings in Singapore till October.

This is the second time both cruise lines have extended their sailings, with the first extension to June announced in February.

The cruise-to-nowhere pilot allows the two operators - who are homeported in Singapore - to offer round trips with no ports of call.

Royal Caribbean said that since its first cruise in December, it has completed over 30 successful sailings with more than 50,000 guests.

Demand for cruises will continue to be high with the roll-out of vaccines globally, said company president Michael Bayley.

The new sailings which are part of the extended season from July to October will be available for booking from April 13.

To operate cruises to nowhere, both Royal Caribbean International and Genting Cruise Lines have to abide by STB's CruiseSafe guidelines.

They include operating at a reduced capacity of up to 50 per cent and abiding by strict safety measures and infection protocols.

Passengers embarking on such cruises need to take a mandatory Covid-19 test before boarding and must use TraceTogether for effective contact tracing.

They must also observe safe distancing measures and not intermingle between groups.

When asked whether the capacity of its cruises may be increased from the current 50 per cent, Royal Caribbean International said it is hopeful that sailing passenger capacity will be increased to be in line with that of hotels and other land-based attractions in Singapore.

""Unlike hotels and other land-based attractions, we test all guests and crew members for COVID-19 as part of our health and safety protocols,"" it said.

Globally, the cruise industry is also making a comeback.","Other cruise lines have expressed interest in joining the pilot programme, noted Ms Chang.

44,singapore,"Singapore, China looking at how to gradually resume travel links: Vivian Balakrishnan","SINGAPORE: Singapore and China are looking at how travel links between the two countries can resume, Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Wednesday (Mar 31).

Dr Balakrishnan was speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Fujian, where he met China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.



""Now in a post-COVID recovery phase, we are looking at how - as both Singapore and China reopen the economy - we can slowly, gradually and carefully resume travel links as well,"" Dr Balakrishnan said.

""So some of the things which we discussed is the mutual recognition of health certification, and I want to emphasise that this goes beyond just vaccines, but into serology, into PCR nucleic acid tests and the rest of it.

""There will need to be verifiable, authorised sources of this information, and again we need to be able to exchange relevant subsets of this information in a way that would facilitate safe travel for all the people concerned.""



This comes after Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore welcomed China’s recent proposal on the mutual recognition of health certificates, calling it a ""timely initiative"" as both countries have begun vaccination programmes.

""These health certificates would be an important enabler for the safe resumption of cross-border travel while protecting public health,"" he told China's Xinhua news agency on Tuesday.

""It is important that we work together early to ensure that the systems are interoperable.""



Singapore and China already have a ""fast lane"" arrangement to facilitate essential travel for business and official purposes.

The arrangement applies to travel between Singapore and six Chinese provinces or municipalities directly under the central government - Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.



Singapore has also unilaterally lifted border restrictions for travellers from China.



Dr Balakrishnan said on Wednesday that Singapore had opened its borders to travellers from China as the latter's COVID-19 case control was ""so good"".

""We are confident that they can come across to Singapore, we test them (and) if they are clear, they can proceed with their activities,"" he said.

""China's obviously looking at our figures and the fact that we're making good progress, both in terms of case control and vaccination.""



Dr Balakrishnan, however, said he was not ready to give a timeline on when more travel links between the two countries might resume, although he said the issue was ""moving in the positive direction"".

""I know that there are also Singaporeans who are studying in China who also want to get back, and I can assure them that I put in that request for them as well,"" he added.



SITUATION IN MYANMAR ""DOUBLY TRAGIC""

Dr Balakrishnan's trip to Fujian comes after his recent trips to Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Last Monday, Dr Balakrishnan met Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Second Minister of Foreign Affairs Erywan Pehin Yusof.

During the meeting with Mr Erywan, both ministers agreed that the ongoing situation in Myanmar was of deep concern, and urged all sides in Myanmar to seek a peaceful solution.

Dr Balakrishnan said on Wednesday that he also discussed with his Chinese counterpart the ""very troubling circumstances in Myanmar"".

On Saturday, Myanmar's security forces shot and killed more than 100 protesters in the bloodiest day of protests since a military coup last month, news reports and witnesses said.



The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said it had confirmed a total of 521 civilian deaths by late Tuesday night, but warned the true toll was probably significantly higher.



""First, I will speak from a Singapore perspective: We are alarmed (and) appalled at the escalating violence, particularly over the weekend on what was supposed to be Armed Forces Day,"" Dr Balakrishnan said, referring to the events in Myanmar on Saturday.

""In fact (it) turned out to be a day with perhaps the highest level of fatalities. This is tragic, this is doubly tragic. Again, we air our voice to the military authorities to act with restraint, de-escalate the violence, commence dialogue, honest constructive dialogue between two sides.""



From his discussions with Mr Wang, Dr Balakrishnan said he believes that China also shares Singapore's hope for the de-escalation of tension, halting of violence and the start of political dialogue.

""Both of us agree that we should still respect the principle of non-interference in domestic matters,"" he added.

""Ultimately, the fate and the future of Myanmar lies in the hands of its own people. We can try to help, ASEAN, the UN will certainly try to help in a constructive, non-interfering way, but in a way that allows dialogue to occur.

""So, we will have to do so carefully, patiently, and in a way which encourages engagement and conversation, rather than confrontation.""

Lawrence Wong, the country's current education minister and second finance minister, will helm the finance portfolio from May 15, the prime minister's office said on Friday. Wong is also the co-chair of Singapore's taskforce on Covid-19, and has risen in prominence since the coronavirus outbreak last year.

Wong is among potential candidates that analysts said could eventually take over from Lee as prime minister.

46,singapore,Hong Kong requires people leaving for Singapore to be vaccinated: Carrie Lam,"HONG KONG - Amid resumption of talks with Singapore over a much-delayed travel bubble, Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam has said that Singapore will not impose a requirement on travellers from Hong Kong to be vaccinated before their trip.

But Hong Kong will make it mandatory for people leaving the city for Singapore to be vaccinated, she added.

Mrs Lam was echoing statements made by Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau on March 29 when he announced that Hong Kong residents who take part in travel bubble arrangements would have to complete two doses of vaccines and wait at least 14 days after the second jab before they can go on such flights.

Even before the roll-out of the free and voluntary inoculation programme, officials in February said they were reviewing the benefits and incentives people could get in terms of travel and shorter quarantine period once they are vaccinated.

Speaking ahead of her weekly meeting with the Executive Council on Tuesday (April 13), Mrs Lam said: ""The basis for discussion with Singapore is that people leaving Hong Kong and entering Singapore need to be vaccinated.

""We want to provide incentives to encourage Hong Kong citizens to get vaccinated.""

When asked about the timeline, Mrs Lam said she ""expects an early indication of agreement between the two sides"".

Under the original agreement between Singapore and Hong Kong, passengers have to be tested negative for Covid-19 before they can board the direct flights.

Singapore Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung had previously said on Money FM 89.3 that bilateral travel corridors for vaccinated travellers from places with low- and moderate-infection rates could come in the later half of this year.

He added that the removal of quarantine measures and stay-home notice are key to reviving air travel.

Before that, in early March, Mr Ong told Parliament that there were no plans to require travellers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter Singapore.

Talks were restarted after the current wave of infections in Hong Kong was brought under control. The travel bubble was shelved at the last minute in late November, after coronavirus cases spiralled out of control in Hong Kong in the fourth wave of the pandemic. It was again delayed in December after infection numbers spiked in Hong Kong.

Over the past week, the territory has been recording two or three local infections daily. There were 13 new cases, of which three are local, on Tuesday.

48,singapore,"Citi to hire up to 1,500 people in Singapore to boost consumer wealth management businesses","SINGAPORE: Citi plans to hire up to 1,500 more employees in Singapore, as it looks to ramp up its consumer wealth management businesses amid a significant revamp.

The new hires will support its plans to triple its assets under management and increase wealth clients by two and a half times by 2025, a spokesperson told CNA on Monday (Apr 19).

Citi is also adding headcount in Hong Kong, another “wealth hub” it is focusing on in the region.

Altogether, it plans to hire about 2,300 new employees in both Hong Kong and Singapore, including 1,100 relationship managers and private bankers.

This follows the American banking group’s announcement last week that it will exit 13 consumer banking markets in Asia and Europe, citing the lack of scale to compete and a shift in focus to wealth management.

These markets are Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Citi will instead focus its global consumer banking business on four markets - Singapore, Hong Kong, London and the United Arab Emirates.

Chief executive Jane Fraser said last week that with the refresh of its strategy, the bank will “double down” on wealth management where the growth opportunities are better.

As part of its plan, Citi intends to invest in “cutting-edge technology” in both Hong Kong and Singapore, the bank said in a press release on Monday.

Citi said that refreshed digital value propositions, such as a new mobile banking experience with enhanced wealth management tools, have helped to drive “significant” client momentum and growth in Asia Pacific in recent years.

Last year, it saw more than US$20 billion in net new money inflows across the region, marking a record year for its global wealth franchise.

“The Asia Pacific wealth market stands out in its scale and growth potential. And this is not a cyclical opportunity – it is structural, driven by the emergence of a vast middle class and the rapid development of regional capital markets,” said chief executive for Asia-Pacific Peter Babej in the release.

“Along with macro-level asset growth, Asian customers increasingly require portfolio advice, design and allocation geared toward diversification of asset types and geographic exposures,” he added.

Singapore is already home to Citi’s biggest wealth advisory hub around the world, which opened doors in December last year. The hub expects to serve about 150 clients a day, according to media reports.

49,singapore,1 dormitory resident among 20 new COVID-19 infections in Singapore; first such case in 6 weeks,"SINGAPORE: One dormitory resident was among the 20 new COVID-19 infections reported in Singapore on Sunday (Apr 11).

This is the first such case since Feb 28. No new infections were reported in the community.



The remaining 19 cases were imported infections and were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.



Identified as Case 61822, the dormitory resident is a 23-year-old work permit holder from India. He is employed by Seafront Support Company as a lashing specialist and resides in a dormitory located at Brani Terminal Avenue.

The man is asymptomatic, said MOH, adding that he was detected after being tested on Apr 7 as part of rostered routine resting. His pooled test result came back positive the following day, and he was immediately isolated.

An individual test was done on Apr 9, and it came back positive on Apr 10. He was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

His serology test result came back positive, but MOH has assessed that this is likely a current infection.



MOH said that the man received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 25 and a second on Feb 17.

""This likely accounts for his lack of symptoms, and positive serology test as he has produced antibodies following the vaccination,"" said the Health Ministry.

""This case is a reminder that it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected,"" MOH added.

""But the vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated.



""Further research is required to determine if the vaccination will also prevent onward transmission of the infection. That is why we cannot afford to let our guard down.""

Epidemiological investigations are in progress. All the identified close contacts of the man, including his dormitory and workplace contacts, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that asymptomatic cases can be detected.

MOH will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.



The Singapore Flyer and Time Capsule was added to the list of places visited by COVID-19 cases during their infectious period.

IMPORTED CASES

The remaining 19 cases were imported infections and were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore.



One case is a Singaporean who returned from Indonesia, while five are permanent residents who returned from India.

Two cases are dependent's pass holders who arrived from India, while one is a short-term visit pass holder who also arrived from India for studies in Singapore.

The remaining 10 imported cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, including four who are foreign domestic workers.







THIRTEEN CASES DISCHARGED

Thirteen more cases have been discharged, bringing the total who have fully recovered from the infection to 60,335.

There are 58 cases remaining in hospital, with one in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

Another 230 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks.

The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks.



Of the 175 confirmed cases reported between Apr 5 and Apr 11, 68 tested positive for their serology tests and 74 tested negative while another 33 test results are pending.

As of Sunday, Singapore has reported a total of 60,653 COVID-19 cases and 30 fatalities.



LUCKY PLAZA, PENINSULA PLAZA WEEKEND RESTRICTIONS LIFTED

Weekend entry restrictions at Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza were lifted on Saturday, more than seven months after they were put in place as part of COVID-19 measures.

Visitors are still strongly advised to not rush to these malls immediately or visit during peak hours, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said on Friday.

“To avoid a longer waiting time to enter the malls, patrons should plan their visits during weekdays or non-peak periods on weekends,"" they added.

Odd-even entry restrictions based on the last digit of the identification number for each visitor have been in place at the malls since Aug 29 last year.

“Improvements in the crowding situation” have been observed at the two malls, said STB and ESG.

SINGAPORE, May 20 (Reuters) - Singapore on Thursday ordered Facebook (FB.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) to carry a correction notice to users of the social media platforms in the country over what it says is a false statement about a new virus variant originating in Singapore.

The ministry of health said it was aware of the statement circulating online on media outlets and social media platforms, which implied that a new, previously unknown variant of COVID-19 originated in Singapore and risked spreading to India from the city-state.

The move came after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a Twitter post this week that a new form of the virus that was particularly harmful to children had come to Singapore, and urged for a ban on flights.

The claims were reported in articles published by the Hindustan Times and NDTV, both publications from India.

The articles quoted tweets from Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was cited as saying that the new strain is “extremely dangerous for children” and could result in a third wave of infection in India.

MOH said in response on Tuesday that “there is no ‘Singapore variant’”.

“The strain that is prevalent in many of the COVID-19 cases in recent weeks is the B16172 variant, which originated in India,” it said.

“Phylogenetic testing has shown this B16172 variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore.”

Two COVID-19 sub-variants from India have been detected among imported and community cases in Singapore, including those who have been linked to the Tan Tock Seng and Changi Airport clusters.

In the media reports in India, Mr Kejriwal was also cited as urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to immediately cancel air services with Singapore and prioritise the vaccination of children.

Mr Kejriwal also made those views known on Twitter, which Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan responded to on Wednesday morning:","SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (May 18) said that there is “no truth whatsoever” in the assertion in several news reports in India that there is a Singapore variant of the COVID-19 virus.

SINGAPORE — Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index closed 2.18% lower on Friday after the government announced further tightening in Covid-19 restrictions and the likelihood that the air travel bubble with Hong Kong may be delayed again. Aviation-related stocks were hit hard. Singapore Airlines dived 5.66% while SATS, an aviation catering and airport ground handling firm, fell 3.91%. The Singapore government said it's ""very likely"" that the travel bubble with Hong Kong will not begin on May 26 as planned. It comes as the Southeast Asian country further tightened measures to curb rising local Covid cases, including stopping all dine-in services and capping public gatherings to two. The Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble would have allowed travelers to skip quarantine. It has faced multiple delays from its initial launch date on November 2020 as Hong Kong reported resurgence in Covid-19 cases.

Both Singapore and Hong Kong are major Asian business hubs without domestic air travel markets. Their tourism and aviation industries, heavily reliant on international travel, have been badly hit by the pandemic. Singapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said Hong Kong is ""a very safe region"" now, with few new Covid cases detected daily. However, infections in Singapore have been climbing and the city-state likely won't meet the threshold to start the travel bubble, he added. Singapore and Hong Kong have previously agreed that the travel arrangement will be suspended if the number of unlinked local Covid cases in either cities exceed five on a seven-day moving average basis.

In a preliminary update on Friday, Singapore's health ministry said it has confirmed 52 new cases of Covid-19. Among the cases, 24 are locally transmitted infections — four of which were not linked to previous cases. The latest numbers take the Southeast Asian city-state's cumulative confirmed infections to more than 61,500, according to health ministry data. Meanwhile, Hong Kong on Friday identified one imported case, bringing its total of confirmed or probable infections to 11,819 since the outbreak, official data showed. The city has reported 210 deaths, according to the data. Ong said he's spoken with Edward Yau, Hong Kong's secretary for commerce and economic development, about the Covid situation in Singapore. Both sides will make a decision early next week on whether to go ahead with the air travel bubble launch, said Ong.

Singapore tightens restrictions

The Singapore government also announced there will be more Covid-19 restrictions starting this weekend following a rise in local infections. The measures will take effect from this Sunday until June 13. The new measures include: No dining-in at food and beverage establishments;

Smaller social gatherings: A maximum of two people are allowed, from five previously;

All workers who can work from home will have to do so. The government will review the measures at the mid-way point — or around two weeks later — to see if there's a need to adjust them, said Lawrence Wong, Singapore's education minister and co-chair of the Covid taskforce.

Confirms 38 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases on Sunday

Inoculation programme limited by pace of supplies

Working on plans to vaccinate children below 16 years

SINGAPORE, May 16 (Reuters) - Singapore warned on Sunday that the new coronavirus variants, such as the one first detected in India, were affecting more children, as the city-state prepares to shut most schools from this week and draws up plans to vaccinate youngsters.

All primary, secondary and junior colleges will shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday until the end of the school term on May 28.

""Some of these (virus) mutations are much more virulent, and they seem to attack the younger children,"" said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

None of the children who have contracted the virus are seriously ill and a few have mild symptoms, he added.

On Sunday, Singapore confirmed 38 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, the highest daily number since mid-September, with 17 currently unlinked. The cases included four children linked to a cluster at a tuition centre.

The B1617 strain appeared to affect children more, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, citing the ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak. It was not clear how many children had contracted the strain.

Singapore has reported more than 61,000 virus cases, with the bulk linked to outbreaks last year in foreign worker dormitories, and 31 deaths. Sunday's new cases were the highest number of local infections outside of the dormitories in a year.

""The sharp rise in the number of community cases today requires us to significantly reduce our movements and interactions in the coming days,"" Chan added.

The Asian trade and financial hub of 5.7 million people had until recently been reporting almost zero or single-digit daily infections locally for months.

Though Singapore's daily cases are still only a fraction of the numbers being reported among its Southeast Asian neighbours, infections have been increasing in recent weeks. From Sunday, the government implemented its strictest curbs on gatherings and public activities since a lockdown last year. read more

But the speed of Singapore's inoculation programme is being limited by the pace of vaccine supply arrivals. Experts are studying whether to give one dose of the vaccine and extend the interval between shots, said Ong.

Over a fifth of the country's population has completed the two-dose vaccination regimen with vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O). Authorities will invite people under 45 years of age to receive shots from the second half of May.

Chan said the government is also working on plans to vaccinate children below 16 years after regulatory approval, which was being sought by Pfizer.

58,singapore,9 locally transmitted cases among 34 new COVID-19 infections in Singapore; 1 new death,"SINGAPORE: An 88-year-old Singaporean has died from complications due to COVID-19 infection on Saturday (May 1), said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

This brings the total number of deaths related to the coronavirus in Singapore to 31.

She had been warded in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Ward 9D from Apr 14, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on Apr 28.

She had a history of cancer, hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, stroke and hyperlipidaemia.

""In her last moments, special arrangements were made for her family to video conference her and visit her from outside her isolation room,"" said TTSH in a Facebook post on Sunday.

""Our deepest condolences go out to her family and we will continue to offer all the assistance they may need during this difficult time.""

LOCALLY TRANSMITTED CASES

Nine locally transmitted cases were among the 34 new COVID-19 infections reported in Singapore as of noon on Saturday, MOH said in its preliminary daily update.

Of the locally transmitted cases, seven are in the community. Three of these are linked to Case 62541, a 46-year-old female Philippine national who is a nurse, and were detected from the Health Ministry's testing of patients and staff members at TTSH.

The new cases linked to the TTSH cluster are all elderly people aged 70 and above.

The first case linked to the cluster is an 86-year-old Singaporean whose spouse had been warded from Apr 20 to Apr 22 in TTSH Ward 9D, where Case 62541 worked.

She sought medical treatment for an unrelated condition at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Apr 30, and was found to have a fever.

She was tested for COVID-19 and her test result came back positive on the same day. Her serological test result is pending.

The second case is a 70-year-old Singaporean who was admitted to Ward 9D on Apr 22.

He tested negative for COVID-19 on Apr 28 while warded at TTSH as part of the testing of staff and patients who have been in the affected wards.

He was transferred to NCID on Apr 28.

On Apr 30, he developed fever and shortness of breath, and was tested again. His test result then came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.

The third case linked to the cluster is a 74-year-old Singaporean who was warded in Ward 9D from Apr 23 to Apr 27.

She was placed on quarantine on Apr 29, and tested for COVID-19 on Apr 30 during quarantine.

Her test result came back positive on May 1, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. Her serological test result is pending.

There are now 16 cases linked to the cluster at the hospital.

OTHER COMMUNITY CASES

The other four cases in the community are unlinked.

One of the cases is a 19-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident who is a student at Singapore Management University (SMU).

She has been attending classes virtually, except for a physical visit to SMU on Apr 21.

She arrived from India on Dec 28 last year, and served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility.

While she was serving stay-home notice, she had been identified as a close contact of Case 58784 during their flight to Singapore, and was placed on quarantine from Dec 29, 2020 to Jan 11, 2021.

Her test taken on Jan 8 during quarantine was negative for COVID-19.

She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Apr 28 in preparation for a trip.

Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to Changi General Hospital in an ambulance.

Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result came back positive.

""She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure,"" said MOH.

Another unlinked community case is a 22-year-old Malaysia national who works as a spa therapist at Spa 9, located at 41 Holland Drive.

She developed a runny nose on Apr 28, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic, where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive the next day.

Her serological test result has come back negative.

The third unlinked community case is a 50-year-old Singapore Permanent Resident who works as a manager at DIC Asia Pacific, located at 78 Shenton Way.

She had only gone to work on Apr 26 and Apr 27 in the past month.

She had been in Japan from Mar 13 to Apr 9, and served stay-home notice upon her return to Singapore at a dedicated facility until Apr 23.

Her test taken on Apr 22 during stay-home notice was negative for COVID-19.

She developed body aches on Apr 27 and a fever the next day, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic on Apr 29, where she was tested for COVID-19.

Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance.

Her serological test result has come back negative.

A fourth unlinked case is a 15 year-old student at Edgefield Secondary School; she was last in school on Apr 29.

DORMITORY CASES

The remaining two locally transmitted cases reside in a dormitory, Pasir Panjang Residence, located at 33 Harbour Drive.

They have both received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

One of the dormitory cases is a 35-year-old Myanmar national. He is a work permit holder who arrived in Singapore in January 2020.

He works as a stevedore at Pasir Panjang Terminal and Brani Terminal.

The other is a 23-year-old India national. He is a work permit holder who arrived in Singapore in December 2020. He works as a stevedore at Pasir Panjang Terminal.

IMPORTED CASES

Twenty-five cases were imported and were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, the ministry said.

Of the imported cases, five are Singaporeans, and four are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, UK and US.

Five are dependant's pass holders, and four are work pass holders, all of whom arrived from India and Nepal.

Four are work permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines, all of whom are foreign domestic workers.

Two are short-term visit pass holders who arrived from the Philippines. One arrived to visit family members who are Singaporeans, and the other is here for a work project.

The remaining imported case is a special pass holder who is a sea crew. He arrived from India and had remained onboard until he was conveyed to a hospital.

MOH said 14 more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,765 have fully recovered from the infection.

There are now 111 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with none in the intensive care unit.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from 11 in the week before to 37 in the past week. Unlinked cases in the community have also increased from four in the week before to 10 in the past week.







TAN TOCK SENG HOSPITAL CLUSTER

The Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster is Singapore's first hospital cluster and currently the country's largest.

A total of four hospital wards have now been locked down, up from two wards on Thursday.

This means there will be no movement in and out of those wards except for essential testing, said the hospital's CEO Dr Eugene Soh at a press conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Friday.

There are currently 1,100 inpatients and 4,500 staff members working at the main hospital wards – all of whom will be swabbed, said Dr Soh.

Visitors are not allowed at the hospital except on a case-by-case basis for patients who are critically ill.

Singapore will stop entry or transit for visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the COVID-19 task force also announced on Friday.

The ban starts on May 2 and covers all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have been in the four countries in the last 14 days, including transit.

Locally, MOH said that individuals should limit their social interactions in view of the growing number of community cases.

While the current eight-person limit on unique household visitors and gatherings in public places remains in place, MOH’s guidance is that such social interactions should be capped at two per day.

As of Saturday, Singapore has reported a total of 61,179 COVID-19 cases.

SINGAPORE — Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Monday that the country's Covid restrictions may be relaxed after June 13 if the situation improves. ""Barring another super-spreader or big cluster, we should be on track to bring this outbreak under control,"" he said in a televised address. ""If our situation continues to improve, and the number of community cases falls further, we should be able to relax the restrictions after 13 June,"" he said. The Southeast Asian nation imposed tighter measures twice in May, after the number of local coronavirus infections climbed higher in April. The surge in cases also led to another delay of the travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong.

Lee said Singapore is fighting ""more infectious virus strains,"" and will need to inoculate as many as possible to reach ""herd immunity"" — which occurs when sufficient people in the community are infected or vaccinated, and the disease can no longer spread rapidly. ""We must continually adjust our strategies, and raise our game to keep Covid-19 under control,"" he said, adding that the country will need to test, trace and vaccinate its population more quickly. Singapore is using various types of Covid-19 tests along with polymerase chain reaction tests, which are widely viewed as the gold standard. ""You should expect routine, large-scale, fast and simple testing to be part of our new normal,"" Lee said. As for contact tracing, people who live with a close contact of an infected case will now need to be isolated. Previously, only the close contacts would need to be quarantined. ""This more aggressive approach will help us to shut down clusters more quickly,"" he said.

60,singapore,"BioNTech to produce mRNA vaccines in Singapore, its new regional headquarters","SINGAPORE: German biotechnology firm BioNTech, which partnered Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, will set up its regional headquarters in Singapore, along with a manufacturing facility.



The new facility will provide ""regional and global supply capacity of BioNTech's mRNA-based product candidates"" and serve as ""a rapid response production capability for Southeast Asia to address potential pandemic threats”, the company said on Monday (May 10).

BioNTech added that it plans to open its Singapore office and initiate construction of the manufacturing facility this year, subject to planning approval.

The facility could be operational as early as 2023 and create up to 80 jobs in Singapore.

In its media release, BioNTech said the new facility, supported by Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB), ""will leverage cutting-edge manufacturing and digital infrastructure"".

It will be equipped to ""produce a range of novel mRNA vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancer"", it added.

Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, speaking at an online press conference after the announcement, said the new investment is “a boost” to the local biopharmaceutical ecosystem.



Noting that the new mRNA technology has “drastically reduced” the time needed for vaccines to be produced, the new facility will also strengthen the portfolio of different vaccine production technologies in Singapore, he added.



“There will be new viruses that will emerge in time to come and what we need is a strong R&D partnership to make sure that we continuously evolve our products in a timely fashion to serve our local and regional markets.”

HIGHLY AUTOMATED

The site will be highly automated with ""end-to-end mRNA production capabilities across drug substance, drug product and fill-and-finish, with an estimated annual capacity of several hundred of million doses of mRNA-based vaccines depending on the specific vaccine"", the company said.

BioNTech did not release any information regarding the total sum of investment in Singapore.



Noting that Singapore provides an ""excellent business climate"" with a growing biotechnology industry and rich talent base, BioNTech co-founder and chief executive Ugur Sahin said: “Having multiple nodes in our production network is an important strategic step in building out our global footprint and capabilities.

""With this planned mRNA production facility, we will increase our overall network capacity and expand our ability to manufacture and deliver our mRNA vaccines and therapies to people around the world.""

EBD chairman Beh Swan Gin said the investment will enable Singapore to ""develop capabilities in an important new therapeutic modality"" as part of its strategy to grow the biopharmaceutical industry here.

“In particular, BioNTech’s mRNA manufacturing facility will contribute significantly to the region’s ability to address future pandemic threats,"" he said.

It plans to open its Singapore office and start the construction of the manufacturing facility in 2021, subject to planning approval. The site is expected to be operational in 2023 and will create at least 80 jobs, the German company said on Monday (May 10).

These include roles in quality control, quality assurance and management.

It added that the expansion plan is supported by Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB).

BioNTech chief executive and co-founder Ugur Sahin told reporters in a Web conference on Monday that establishing a manufacturing hub in Singapore will mean that ""a certain percentage (of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured) will go to Singapore"".

He also said: ""But we have to be clear that starting a manufacturing building in Singapore will not help us in the next 12 months with regard to the global supply (of the Covid-19 vaccine).

""The global supply can only be addressed by increasing the existing production capacities. We did that and they will continue to do that in the next 12 months.""

The plan is to deliver up to three billion doses in 2021, together with Pfizer - more than 50 per cent higher than initially announced. Over 40 per cent will be supplied to low- and middle-income countries, Dr Sahin added.

The surge in global demand for the vaccine has seen more manufacturing sites set up in countries such as Germany and Belgium, as well as states in the United States, to boost production.

Demand has outstripped supply in almost every country. Across the world, over 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered.

The World Health Organisation has said the world is in a ""vaccine crisis"", calling on the Group of Seven countries to fund the global Covid-19 recovery and ensure most adults around the world get immunised.

Dr Sahin also said that BioNTech is in discussions on whether to acquire an existing building or build new infrastructure to house the new manufacturing facility.

In response to questions on the value of the investment in Singapore, Dr Sahin said it is ""in the range of hundreds of millions of US dollars"".

He added: ""We're looking at this as a long-term investment in biotech in Singapore... It extends beyond Covid-19.

65,singapore,Singapore tests thousands as unlinked Covid-19 cases persist,"Singapore will test thousands of people for Covid-19 as the number of infections unlinked to current virus clusters continued to rise over the weekend.

An additional 10 Covid-19 cases were reported by the country’s health ministry late on Sunday, including a private-hire driver with Grab Holdings Inc., an employee at Lendlease Pte and a landscaper at government agency National Parks Board, none of whom are linked to previous virus cases. Separately, four individuals are connected to an earlier cluster at Changi Airport and three are related to the cluster at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

The number of unlinked virus cases in the local community has risen to 13 cases in the past week from 10 the week before, the government said Sunday.

The Southeast Asian country will expand virus testing to about 9,000 workers at two of the airport’s terminals and the connected Jewel shopping mall in a bid to stem the spread. Close to 4,000 port workers will also undergo testing after four people at the city-state’s seaport facilities were detected to have Covid-19 over the past 10 days.

The Maritime and Port Authority said Sunday that 2,750 people have so far tested negative for coronavirus.

The mass testing strategy will also include about 2,200 students, staff and visitors at Victoria Junior College after a student registered positive for the virus in recent days, the Ministry of Education said on Saturday. Just over 100 people who are close contacts of the infected individual will be quarantined as well.

The threat had been easing for Singapore until a few weeks ago when new clusters started to emerge, including cases with the variant of Covid-19 first detected in India. Tighter social-distancing measures kicked in for the country on Saturday with officials saying they were necessary to prevent a harsher lockdown similar to one last year.

A rise in unlinked cases in Singapore could jeopardize a planned travel bubble with Hong Kong, scheduled to begin on May 26. According to the terms of the agreement, the air-travel corridor will be closed for two weeks if the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local cases is more than five in either city.

REUTERS/Chen Lin/File Photo

SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Singapore authorities have provisionally approved a COVID-19 breathalyser test that aims to show whether someone is infected with the coronavirus in under a minute, according to the local startup that developed the product.

Breathonix, a spin-off company from the National University of Singapore (NUS), said it is now working with the health ministry to run a deployment trial of the technology at one of the city-state's border points with Malaysia.

The breath analysis will be carried out alongside the current compulsory COVID-19 antigen rapid test.

The tests would be sold for between S$5-S$20 ($3.76-$15.03) each, depending on the number purchased, said a company representative.

The breath test achieved more than 90% accuracy in a Singapore-based pilot clinical trial, the company said last year.

The Health Sciences Authority's website confirmed the approval, which the company said was the first such system to secure provisional authorisation in Singapore.

The system uses disposable mouthpieces and is designed to ensure there is no cross-contamination. After blowing into the device, the technology assesses the chemical compounds of the breath to determine whether or not a person is infected.

Any individual screened as positive will need to undergo a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 swab test, the company said.

Breathonix said it is in discussion with several local and overseas organisations to use the system, citing strong commercial interest. Other countries, including Indonesia and the Netherlands, have rolled out similar breath tests.

After recording almost zero or single-digit daily coronavirus tallies locally for months, Singapore has seen the number of infections grow recently and include variants such as more contagious strains first detected in India.

Singapore, which reported 24 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases on Monday, has re-imposed for a month the toughest restrictions on social gatherings since exiting a lockdown last year in a bid to contain the outbreak. read more

68,singapore,COVID-19: Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble to be deferred for a second time,"SINGAPORE: The launch of the Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble, originally planned for May 26, will be deferred for the second time.



The deferment comes amid a recent increase in unlinked COVID-19 community cases in Singapore. The country is ""unable to meet the criteria to start"" the air travel bubble, said Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT) on Monday (May 17).

The authorities will review a new launch date towards the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which runs to Jun 13.



The air travel bubble, which was initially due to launch on Nov 22 last year, was deferred after a rise in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong.

Both cities announced on Apr 26 – before the increase in unlinked community cases in Singapore – that the travel bubble would resume on May 26.



Under the terms of the agreement, the travel bubble will be suspended for at least 14 days if the seven-day moving average of unlinked local COVID-19 cases a day, excluding dormitory resident cases in Singapore, is more than five in either Singapore or Hong Kong.



PROTECT THE HEALTH OF TRAVELLERS AND PUBLIC

Singapore's Minister for Transport S Iswaran had a meeting on Monday morning with Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau on the travel bubble.



""Both sides ... agreed to defer the launch of the air travel bubble to protect the health of travellers and the public in these two places,” said MOT.



“Singapore and Hong Kong will closely monitor the public health situation in both places and review the new launch date of the air travel bubble flights towards the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in Singapore.”



MOT said both cities remain ""strongly committed"" to launching the travel bubble safely.

A Hong Kong government spokesperson said they will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation in both cities.

""During this period, both sides will continue to maintain communication, exchange relevant data and statistics, and review developments closely before deciding on the way forward with the inaugural flights under the air travel bubble,"" the spokesperson added.

""A further announcement will be made on or before Jun 13.""



Travellers may still continue their journey on non-designated air travel bubble flights, but such travellers will be subject to the prevailing border control and health requirements of both places.



Singapore residents returning from Hong Kong will be subject to a seven-day stay-home notice upon entry into Singapore.



MOT added that airlines will be contacting affected passengers to provide assistance. Passengers may also reach out to their airlines regarding their travel plans.

Singapore on Monday reported 28 new COVID-19 cases, including 21 in the community. Ten of the new community cases are linked to previous infections, while 11 are currently unlinked.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday said the number of new cases in the community has increased from 39 in the week before to 131 in the past week.

The number of unlinked cases has also increased from six in the week before to 32 in the past week.

The Changi Airport COVID-19 cluster is currently the largest active cluster in Singapore, with 74 cases linked as of Sunday.

Morrison is the first foreign leader to make an official visit to the city-state since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. He stopped in Singapore on his way to Britain for the G7 Leaders' Summit.

The leaders' discussions also included a potential fintech bridge and exploration of a green economy agreement.

Morrison said he welcomed the countries working together to put the systems in place to enable a bubble to emerge between them.

Global Citizen campaigns on the United Nations' Global Goals, including goal 14 for life below water and goal 15 for life on land. As much as 300 million tonnes of plastic are produced each year — half of which is made in Asia. Join the movement and call on governments, businesses and individuals to work together to safeguard the natural environment. Take action here

Sri Lanka is currently dealing with ""the worst beach pollution in our history,"" after a Singapore-owned container ship carrying toxic chemicals caught fire, burnt for 12 consecutive days, and spilled plastic debris and other hazardous waste into the ocean.

The ship, carrying tens of tons of nitric acid, caustic soda, sodium methoxide and methane, was located nine miles off the coast of the capital of Colombo when it caught fire on May 20.



An explosion occurred two days later, sending black smoke billowing into the sky and containers of raw materials used to make plastic products into the ocean and onto the shore.

The fire was finally extinguished on Tuesday.



Dharshani Lahandapura, the chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), said the containers held plastic pellets known as nurdles.



The nurdles can turn into microplastics, which can stay in the ocean permanently and can be fatal for animals like turtles, fish, and birds — many of which have already begun to wash up on the shore.

The released chemicals, meanwhile, can cause decade-long damage to reefs and mangroves.

""With the available information so far, this can be described as the worst disaster in my lifetime,” Lahandapura told the Guardian.

Once the fire was under control, Sri Lanka turned its attention to X-Press Feeders, the company that operates the ship.



The general manager of MEPA, Terney Pradeep Kumara, said the company would face criminal charges under the nation’s Marine Pollution Prevention Act. Further claims will also be made once the extension of environmental damage is fully assessed.

The ship is still “facing an imminent risk of going down,” which would cause an oil spill of unimaginable consequences.



“From the very first day, we have been collecting data regarding the ship and the pollution. After we settled the immediate issue of the fire and the safety of the crew, it is high time we take legal action,” Kumara told The Straits Times.



Fishing has been banned across 80 kilometres of the coast to protect human health.","As much as 300 million tonnes of plastic are produced each year — half of which is made in Asia.

75,singapore,Singapore preparing road map for living with Covid-19,"SINGAPORE - Singapore will prepare its population to deal with Covid-19 as part of their daily lives and people will be able to work, travel and shop without quarantines and lockdowns, even with the coronavirus in their midst.

With enough people vaccinated, Covid-19 will be managed like other endemic diseases such as the common flu and hand, foot and mouth disease, said the three co-chairmen of the Government's multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 as they outlined plans for Singapore to transition to a new normal.

Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong and Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said in an article published in The Straits Times on Thursday (June 24) that the priority in the next few months will be to prepare Singapore for life with Covid-19 as a recurring, controllable disease.

""It has been 18 months since the pandemic started and our people are battle-weary. All are asking: When and how will the pandemic end?"" they said.

""The bad news is that Covid-19 may never go away. The good news is that it is possible to live normally with it in our midst.""

A road map is being drawn up to shift to this new normal and it will be done in tandem with achieving certain vaccination milestones.

Singapore has been taking steps to prepare for Covid-19 becoming endemic and has ramped up its vaccination drive amid the battle to bring down the spike in cases.

Vaccination already appears to be effective in reducing the rates of infection and transmission. Most fully vaccinated people show mild or no symptoms even if they contract the disease.

By early next month, two-thirds of the population in Singapore will have received at least one jab of the two-jab vaccines, said the ministers.

""Our next milestone will be to have at least two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated with two doses around National Day, supply permitting. We are working to bring forward the delivery of vaccines and to speed up the process,"" they said.

In time, said the ministers, people with Covid-19 will be allowed to recover at home, so there will be less concern about the healthcare system being stressed. Their close contacts can buy test kits from pharmacies to test themselves.

In fact, testing will no longer be a tool for ring-fencing and quarantining people, but will be used more for screening those who want to enter office buildings, malls and schools, among other places.

The daily updates on infection numbers will also shift to focus on outcomes, such as how many patients fall very sick and end up needing intensive care, the same way the flu is monitored.","SINGAPORE - Singapore will prepare its population to deal with Covid-19 as part of their daily lives and people will be able to work, travel and shop without quarantines and lockdowns, even with the coronavirus in their midst.

76,singapore,Singapore eases COVID-19 restrictions in two phases: What is allowed and when,"SINGAPORE: It's been almost a month since COVID-19 restrictions were tightened, when another new phrase - Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) - entered the pandemic lexicon.



On Thursday (Jun 10), Singapore's Ministry of Health announced it would ease some of these curbs. This will take place in two phases - on Jun 14, and if the situation remains under control, a week later on Jun 21.

This gradual reopening comes on the back of a fall in the number of COVID-19 community cases. Here's what you can look forward to on Jun 14, and possibly Jun 21.



WHAT IS ALLOWED FROM JUN 14?

BIGGER SOCIAL GATHERINGS

The limit on group sizes for social gatherings will be increased from two to five. Households will also be allowed to receive five distinct visitors per day, up from the current two. The prevailing advice to limit social gatherings to no more than two a day stays.



BIGGER MARRIAGE SOLEMNISATIONS

Up to 250 attendees will be allowed at marriage solemnisations with pre-event testing, up from the current limit of 100. For solemnisations without pre-event testing, a maximum of 50 attendees will be allowed.

Couples will be allowed to unmask for key wedding moments while attendees will be allowed to unmask momentarily for photo-taking. Under current restrictions, attendees have to wear face masks at all times, while the bride and groom may wear face shields.

BIGGER GROUPS FOR ACTIVITIES

Groups of up to five people will be allowed for staycations. Where individuals are all from the same household, the limit is the room’s capacity.

A maximum of 250 attendees will be allowed in cinemas with pre-event testing, up from the current limit of 100. If there are fewer than 50 cinema-goers, pre-event testing will not be required. Food and beverage will remain prohibited.","The prevailing advice to limit social gatherings to no more than two a day stays.

77,singapore,Teen in Singapore admits to sending death threats to Premier League footballer Neal Maupay,"SINGAPORE: A Singaporean teen on Wednesday (Jun 2) admitted to harassing English Premier League footballer Neal Maupay by threatening to kill the Brighton & Hove Albion forward and his family in online messages sent last year.

Derek Ng De Ren, 19, was in Singapore when he sent the threats to Maupay via Instagram direct message, according to court documents.

The court heard that Ng was a junior college student and watched the game between Arsenal and Brighton on television around 10pm on Jun 20 last year, TODAY reported.

The messages, sent on four occasions, came after Ng was upset that Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno suffered a serious knee injury following a tackle by French national Maupay during the game and was stretchered off the pitch. Arsenal went on to lose 2-1.

Ng pleaded guilty to two charges under the Protection from Harassment Act, while two other charges will be taken into consideration during sentencing on Jul 7, according to TODAY.

On the night of Jun 24, four days after the match, Ng sent a message to Maupay that read: ""You think you will get away for injuring Leno? No way in hell bruv ...

""But don't worry you will be safe you won't be hurt. It's more fun watching you feel pain when your loved ones go through suffering.""

The next day, Ng sent another message containing an expletive.

In the wee hours of Jun 26, he also told Maupay: ""Your family will be attacked later in the day, just watch.""

He followed this with another message on Jul 1: ""You think by reporting my account you're safe? I will kill you and your family.""

Ng used ""threatening words with the intent to cause distress"" to Maupay in these messages, said his charge sheets.

POSSIBLE PROBATION, REFORMATIVE TRAINING

During the proceedings on Wednesday, District Judge May Mesenas called for reports to assess if Ng is suitable for probation or reformative training, according to TODAY.

In seeking reports for probation and reformative training, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jeremy Bin was quoted by TODAY as saying that the case was “part of a real and rising trend of offending behaviour, leveraging on technology to cause far-reaching psychological harm to unsuspecting victims without fear of repercussions”.

Ng’s threats were not mild and he had been able to cause material harm to Maupay who was about 10,000km away, the prosecutor added.

Ng’s lawyer Mark Yeo argued that only a probation report was necessary at this point.

“We recognise that the offences committed by the accused are not trivial. Yet they are not so serious as to necessitate the calling of a reformative training report,” he reportedly said.

The judge disagreed and ordered that Ng be remanded for seven days, so that the reformative training report can be prepared.

Probation is usually offered to first-time offenders between the ages of 16 and 21, and does not lead to a recorded criminal conviction. Reformative training, a regimented rehabilitation programme for young offenders who commit relatively serious crimes, is a more severe punishment.

Adult offenders convicted of using threatening words could face a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.

""STRONG MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE"": PREMIER LEAGUE CHIEF

Responding to the outcome on Wednesday, the Premier League said it was alerted to the messages through its online abuse reporting system.

In a press release, the league said its legal team undertook ""a detailed investigation to successfully identify and locate the offender"" and worked with Maupay, Brighton and Singapore authorities to pursue legal action.

The league's Chief Executive Richard Masters said: “This outcome recognises the severity of the offence and we hope it will send a strong message of deterrence by demonstrating there are serious real-life consequences for those who engage in online abuse.”

Maupay said ""the vile and toxic abuse"" which he received ""is a daily occurrence for many professional athletes and public figures"".

Maupay added: ""I hope this goes someway to showing those online trolls that it is totally unacceptable and that the authorities are prepared to take the necessary action.""","SINGAPORE: A Singaporean teen on Wednesday (Jun 2) admitted to harassing English Premier League footballer Neal Maupay by threatening to kill the Brighton & Hove Albion forward and his family in online messages sent last year.

The addition of a new fab, or manufacturing plant, here comes amid a global chip shortage and is expected to add around 1,000 jobs, the firm said on Tuesday (June 22).

About 95 per cent of these jobs will be high-value roles such as equipment technicians, process technicians, and engineers.

GlobalFoundries' investment is in partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and co-investments from customers.

Its investment commitment here is among the largest in recent years, with the Republic attracting investments from multinational companies in the electronics, chemicals, and pharmaceutical industries.

The new fab, which is under construction, will be located in its existing Woodlands campus and is expected to start production in January 2023. It is slated to reach full capacity by early 2024.

The fully automated fab will have about 250,000 sq ft of cleanroom space and add about one-third wafer production capacity to the company's Singapore operations, bringing its capacity to about 1.5 million wafers per year.

Singapore accounts for about one-third of GlobalFoundries' revenue and serves about 200 customers worldwide. The manufacturer has about 4,800 employees here, around a third of its global headcount.

Its chief executive Tom Caulfield said: ""Our new facility in Singapore will support fast-growing end-markets in the automotive, 5G mobility and secure device segments with long-term customer agreements already in place.""

Its expansion in Singapore comes alongside planned investments of over US$1 billion each in manufacturing sites in Germany and the United States, he noted in a virtual press conference on Tuesday.

The US$6 billion committed over the next few years is on top of its planned US$1.4 billion investment in 2021 to raise output at its factories.

The firm is accelerating its investments around the world to meet the challenge of the global chip shortage, Dr Caulfield said, adding that he expects that supply will still be outpaced by demand in the next five to eight years.

It is expanding first in Singapore as the factory here has been around for longest and is at full capacity, he said.

84,singapore,Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 'erroneously' given to 16-year-old boy in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: A first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was erroneously administered to a 16-year-old boy on Thursday (Jun 3) at Kolam Ayer Community Club vaccination centre, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education (MOE).



The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorised for use in Singapore for people aged 18 and above. The vaccination centre at Kolam Ayer Community Club is run by Minmed.



""Our investigations found that the individual’s date of birth had been erroneously entered when booking a vaccination appointment after receiving the sign-up link,"" the ministries said in a joint press release early Friday morning.

""This resulted in his age being incorrectly registered as above 18 years of age, making it possible for a Moderna vaccination centre to be selected.

""The vaccination centre staff had failed to verify his age during registration, which should have been carried out.""

The error was discovered during the post-vaccination observation period when vaccination centre staff members identified that the boy was under 18. He was placed under a longer observation time of 50 minutes as an additional precaution and ""remains generally well"", said the ministries.



The expert committee for COVID-19 vaccination said in a separate statement that it has reviewed the incident where the teen was ""erroneously administered"" the Moderna vaccine dose.

""The expert committee for COVID-19 vaccination does not expect any safety issues from the receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the 16-year-old youth, and the medical team will consult the expert committee on what would be best for the youth for the completion of the vaccination,"" it said.



""Data from a trial involving more than 3,700 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old has found that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective among adolescents with no significant safety issues identified. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and the common ones were injection site pain, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and chills.""



Only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised for use in Singapore for children aged 12 and above.

""The safety of those receiving the vaccination is of utmost priority,"" said the ministries, adding that they take a serious view of the incident.

""We apologise for the inconvenience and anxiety caused, and have reached out to the youth’s parents to explain the situation.""



A ""thorough review"" of internal processes at vaccination sites has been carried out by MOH to prevent a recurrence of the incident. This includes strengthening its online registration process to ensure people make appointments at suitable vaccination centres based on their eligibility, and putting in place more stringent protocols at vaccination sites to verify eligibility.

""We are in close contact with the individual and his family, and will continue to monitor his health closely and provide the necessary support,"" added the ministries.



The committee said that it will continue to monitor ""global evidence"" and developments on COVID-19 vaccines, in particular emerging data on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use for more population subgroups.

86,singapore,"South Korea hopes to expedite talks with Singapore, Taiwan to start travel bubble from July","SEOUL - South Korea is hoping to expedite travel bubble talks with the likes of Singapore and Taiwan to allow quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated people from as early as July, as part of a national campaign to encourage mass vaccination.

The Transport Ministry said on Wednesday (June 9) that it is pushing to allow people who have taken two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to go on group tours to countries that have strong virus control measures in place and have been relatively successful in containing the pandemic.

Only 4.5 per cent of the population, or 2.32 million people, have been fully vaccinated since jabs were rolled out on Feb 26.

The ministry said talks are already under way with Singapore and Taiwan to sign a travel bubble agreement, and it will also reach out to other territories such as Guam, Saipan and Thailand to discuss reopening air travel.

The Straits Times has reached out to Singapore's Ministry of Transport for comment.

South Korean Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Wednesday that border restrictions have dealt a severe blow to the aviation and travel industry for too long, and many people are yearning to go overseas again.

""Resuming international travel will mark the beginning of life going back to normal,"" he said during a meeting.

The transport ministry said it is planning to allow only selected package tours in the first phase of the travel bubble programme, and those who sign up must stick to the itinerary instead of roam freely.

Travellers must also test for Covid-19 and submit negative test results three days before departure and test again upon arrival at their destination.

An official was cited as saying that the prospect of signing a travel bubble deal with Singapore, Guam or Saipan is higher as they have shown a lot of enthusiasm for such an agreement.

Singapore had planned to launch its first bilateral air travel bubble with Hong Kong last November but it was postponed twice due to spikes in Covid-19 cases.

Guam and Saipan, both United States territories, already allow visitors who received US-approved vaccines, such as Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen, to be exempted from a mandatory two-week quarantine.

Jeju Air, South Korea's largest budget airline, has resumed flights to Saipan in anticipation of a surge in travel demand.

The country reported 602 more cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the total to 145,692.

Some 9.2 million people, comprising 17.9 per cent of the population, have received their first shots of the Covid-19 vaccine as at Wednesday.","SEOUL - South Korea is hoping to expedite travel bubble talks with the likes of Singapore and Taiwan to allow quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated people from as early as July, as part of a national campaign to encourage mass vaccination.
The ministry said talks are already under way with Singapore and Taiwan to sign a travel bubble agreement, and it will also reach out to other territories such as Guam, Saipan and Thailand to discuss reopening air travel.
An official was cited as saying that the prospect of signing a travel bubble deal with Singapore, Guam or Saipan is higher as they have shown a lot of enthusiasm for such an agreement.
Singapore had planned to launch its first bilateral air travel bubble with Hong Kong last November but it was postponed twice due to spikes in Covid-19 cases.

87,singapore,English gaining ground as the language most used at home: Census 2020,"The census of population, conducted once every 10 years, is the largest national survey undertaken in Singapore to collect statistics such as demographic, social and economic data.

A total of 150,000 households were surveyed last year.

ENGLISH MORE COMMON ACROSS MAJOR ETHNIC GROUPS

The trend on the use of English at home was observed across all major ethnic groups. Correspondingly, the use of Mandarin, Chinese dialects, Malay and Tamil lost ground.

For the Chinese ethnic group, English overtook Mandarin as the most used language at home – with a proportion of 47.6 per cent in 2020, up from 32.6 per cent in 2010.

The use of Mandarin as the predominant language fell to 40.2 per cent in 2020, down from 47.7 per cent a decade before.

The same goes for Chinese dialects, which only accounted for 11.8 per cent of responses, down from 19.2 per cent in 2010.

For the Malay ethnic group, a majority still spoke the Malay language most frequently at home in 2020. But at 60.7 per cent, this was lower than the 82.7 per cent recorded in 2010, said the DOS.

The proportion who used English most frequently rose to 39 per cent in 2020, more than double the 17 per cent from a decade before.

Among this group, Malay is still the second most frequently spoken language for more than nine in 10 respondents.

For the Indian ethnic group, those who spoke English most frequently continued to form the majority at 59.2 per cent, up from 41.6 per cent in 2010.

After English, Tamil or other Indian languages were the second most frequently spoken language.

TAKING AGE INTO ACCOUNT

The use of English at home was generally more common among the younger population than those who are older, the Department of Statistics said.

For Chinese residents, for instance, nearly eight in 10 of those aged between five and 14 used English the most at home in 2020. This is compared to about three in 10 elderly residents – aged 55 and over – who did the same.

This disparity was also seen among the Malays - about six in 10 of young residents spoke English the most, compared to fewer than two in 10 for the elderly.



The gap was narrower for the Indian ethnic group. About seven in 10 of the young residents used English the most at home, while half of elderly residents did so.

Overall, between 2010 and 2020, the use of English grew across all age groups for all ethnic groups.

THROWING EDUCATION INTO THE MIX

This proportion also rose across all education groups, the DOS said.

“In general, residents with higher qualifications were more likely to use English the most frequently at home,” it added.



For example, among Singapore residents aged 15 and above with university degrees, English was the most-used language at home for about six in 10 of the Chinese, Malays and Indians in 2020.

But among those with below secondary qualifications, this figure fell to about one in 10 for the Chinese and Malays, and about three in 10 for Indians, said the DOS.

More information from the census will be released on Friday.","For the Chinese ethnic group, English overtook Mandarin as the most used language at home – with a proportion of 47.6 per cent in 2020, up from 32.6 per cent in 2010.

88,singapore,Wanted French national has continued journey to France after transit in Singapore: MHA,"SINGAPORE - A wanted French national and his family, who had made a transit in Singapore on Sunday (June 13), left Singapore on Tuesday, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

Mr Daillet Remy Vincent Christophe, his partner, Ms Bardet Leonie, and their three children were residing in Malaysia when they were arrested late last month for overstaying in Langkawi island.

The Malaysian authorities deported them to France via Singapore on Sunday.

During their transit in Singapore, the pregnant Ms Bardet had complained of discomfort. She was issued a special pass to enter Singapore and was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital on the advice of doctors at Changi Airport.

A spokesman for MHA said on Wednesday: ""Daillet and the children remained in the transit hotel at Terminal 3. They were not allowed to enter Singapore as they were deportees from Malaysia for France. Bardet was subsequently discharged and reunited with Daillet and the children at the transit hotel.""

On Monday, online portal theVibes.com reported that the five French nationals did not board Air France Flight 257 - a direct flight to Paris - which departed Changi at 10.35pm on Sunday.

Two of the three children, aged 17 and nine, are from Ms Bardet's former marriage. The youngest, aged two, is a child by the couple, said theVibes.com.

Mr Daillet had been illegally living in Langkawi for the last six years under a self-imposed exile, it added.

The portal also said an international arrest warrant was issued by Interpol on Mr Daillet for his alleged role in the abduction of an eight-year-old girl from her grandmother in France in April last year. She was later rescued by French and Swiss police in Switzerland.

The MHA said the five French nationals were not under the custody of the Singapore police at any point during their transit in Singapore.

Its spokesman said: ""As they were transit passengers, they were under the care of the airline that they flew with. Daillet has since been required to continue with his journey to France on 15 June, 2021.""

The airline acceded to Ms Bardet's request of having her and the three children continue their travel to France with Mr Daillet, the spokesman added.","SINGAPORE - A wanted French national and his family, who had made a transit in Singapore on Sunday (June 13), left Singapore on Tuesday, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

89,singapore,US Vice-President Kamala Harris to visit Singapore and Vietnam,"WASHINGTON - United States Vice-President Kamala Harris will travel to Singapore and Vietnam next month to ""strengthen relationships and expand economic cooperation with two critical Indo-Pacific partners of the United States"", her spokesman announced on Friday (July 30).

""During the trip, the Vice-President will engage the leaders of both governments on issues of mutual interest, including regional security, the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and our joint efforts to promote a rules-based international order,"" Ms Symone Sanders said in a brief statement that did not mention dates.

""The Vice-President will also affirm and celebrate the strong cultural and people-to-people ties between the United States and these countries,"" she said.

US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris have made it a top priority to ""rebuild our global partnerships and keep our nation secure, and this upcoming visit continues that work - deepening our engagement in South-east Asia"", Ms Sanders added.

""Vice-President Harris will be the first vice-president to ever visit Vietnam.""

This will be the 56-year-old Californian's first trip outside the Americas since she was sworn into office in January as the first female US vice-president. She is also the first person of colour (she is of Indian-Jamaican heritage) to hold the second-highest office in the country.

Though South-east Asia is not known to be Ms Harris' forte - she is a former prosecutor and was a senator from 2017 to 2020 - the visit comes close on the heels of the swing through the region by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who visited Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Ms Harris' visit affirms the strength of the relationship between the US and Singapore, said the press secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a statement on Friday.

The statement added that Ms Harris, who is visiting Singapore at the invitation of PM Lee, will meet Singapore leaders and discuss ways to deepen bilateral cooperation in multiple areas, including defence, cyber security and digital trade.

PM Lee said: ""I am delighted to welcome Vice-President Harris on her first official visit to Singapore. I look forward to our discussions on strengthening bilateral cooperation and working together on global challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.""

Ms Harris' visits showcase America's long-term commitment to a prosperous and secure South-east Asia, Dr Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told The Straits Times.

""By visiting Singapore and Vietnam, Vice-President Harris can reinforce overlapping strategic interests in a stable, rules-based order with two of the region's most strategic countries,"" he said.

""Despite the obstacles of a pandemic, the White House fully intends to deliver on its promise to work more closely with its key partners on ending Covid-19, jump-starting economic growth, and tackling tomorrow's challenges such as climate change.""

Dr Cronin added: ""The US knows that Singapore's success remains a shining example for the region, and that Vietnam has tremendous potential to help drive the future economy.""

90,singapore,Singapore delays reopening plans after karaoke club cluster,"People sit on the banks of the Singapore River at Clarke Quay in Singapore April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas White

SINGAPORE, July 16 (Reuters) - Singapore said on Friday it would retighten some restrictions on social gatherings, including allowing only two people to dine-in at restaurants, from next week to combat a rise in COVID-19 cases linked to clusters of infections at karaoke bars.

However, authorities will allow fully vaccinated individuals to continue to eat inside in groups of up to five at restaurants that have sufficient checks in place.

The new curbs start from next Mondayand are due to run through to Aug. 8, by which time Singapore is expecting to have two-thirds of its population fully vaccinated.

""There is a real risk that the cases from these clusters would have spread to the community, especially if there are individuals who have not come forward on testing,"" said Lawrence Wong, finance minister and co-chair of the government's coronavirus taskforce.

""Potentially, this means that we can see very large clusters emerging over the coming weeks,"" he said.

Authorities also ordered some 400 nightlife establishments to close for two weeks for inspections, after the flouting of rules by some was blamed for the latest outbreak.

As of Friday, 2,480 individuals had been quarantined as they were identified as close contacts of the infected people, according to health minister Ong Ye Kung.

Singapore is racing to find people linked to the clusters at karaoke or KTV lounges and bars, but there are concerns some patrons could be reluctant to come forward. read more

The government has appealed to guests who recently visited any KTV lounge or interacted with a hostess to get tested, promising that privacy would be protected.

The city-state on Monday eased some restrictions, but driven by the new clustersit reported 53 new local cases on Friday, near a 10-month peak hit earlier this week.

92,singapore,Dream Cruises ship turns back to Singapore after Covid-19 case found on board,"SINGAPORE - Dream Cruises ship World Dream was forced to turn back to Singapore after a Covid-19 case was found on board.

The four-day, three-night cruise to nowhere, which had 1,646 passengers and 1,249 crew members on board, departed on Sunday (July 11). It arrived at the Marina Bay Cruise Centre at around 6.30am on Wednesday (July 14), a few hours before it was originally scheduled to return at 9am.

A 40-year-old passenger was identified as a close contact of a confirmed Covid-19 case on Tuesday and was immediately isolated as part of onboard health protocols, said Singapore Tourism Board's director of cruise Annie Chang on Wednesday. The passenger later underwent polymerase chain reaction tests on board and provisionally tested positive for the coronavirus.

The passenger, who had earlier tested negative during the mandatory pre-departure antigen rapid test (ART) on the day of departure, disembarked from the ship via a dedicated route and gangway and was taken to National University Hospital for confirmatory testing.

The Ministry of Health has since confirmed that the passenger has Covid-19, said Ms Chang. This was also shared with all passengers via an announcement on board the ship at 4pm.

The case is tied to a growing cluster that has been linked to KTV outlets and nightclubs here.

Three travelling companions were isolated on board and have tested negative for Covid-19. All on-board leisure activities, including those at entertainment, recreational and dining venues, have ceased and passengers have been asked to remain in their cabins.

Disembarkation will commence when contact tracing for the positive case is completed, said Ms Chang, adding that close contacts will be quarantined.

However, passengers will only be allowed to leave the Marina Bay Cruise Centre after a mandatory ART. The ship's crew will undergo regular routine testing every seven days and will also undergo the ART.

""As a further precautionary measure, all passengers are also required to monitor their health for 14 days from the date of disembarkation and undergo a swab test at a designated government swabbing facility at the end of the monitoring period,"" she added.

According to a notice from Dream Cruises to passengers seen by The Straits Times, the infected passenger was reported to have received both Covid-19 vaccination doses.

In a separate statement, the cruise operator said the close contacts were identified within an hour, through a system that uses information from the passengers' wearable devices, keycards and closed-circuit television footage ""to create activity maps of all guests"".

""Upon detection, onboard contact tracing was immediately activated to identify and to inform close contact guests and crew for further quarantine and examination,"" it added.

Full cleaning and sanitisation are being carried out on World Dream, including all areas previously visited by the passenger.

93,singapore,Singapore tightens restrictions again as Covid cases rise,"SINGAPORE — Singapore's government on Tuesday said it will again tighten Covid-19 measures as new cases continue to rise, complicating the country's reopening plans.

The measures include reintroducing a ban on dining-in, and limiting the maximum number of people allowed to gather from 5 to 2.

Covid-19 cases in Singapore have been on the rise in recent weeks. Multiple clusters have emerged around karaoke lounges as well as wet markets and hawker food centers, raising authorities' concerns.

94,singapore,130 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Singapore; 5 new clusters,"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 130 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections as of noon on Wednesday (Jul 28), including 27 cases linked to the Jurong Fishery Port/Hong Lim Market & Food Centre cluster and two to the cluster in KTV lounges.

The Jurong Fishery Port cluster has grown to 932 cases and remains the largest active cluster in the country.

Among the new infections, 61 are linked to previous cases and have already been placed in quarantine. Another 21 linked cases were detected through surveillance testing.

The remaining 48 infections are not currently linked to previous cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its preliminary daily update.

Three of the cases are seniors above the age of 70 who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and at risk of serious illness, said MOH.

There were also six imported cases. Two were detected upon arrival, while four developed the illness during the stay-home notice or isolation period.

In total, Singapore reported 136 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.

5 NEW CLUSTERS

Five new clusters have been identified, taking the total number of active clusters in Singapore to 44. The size of these clusters range between three and 932 infections.

Among the new clusters is a cluster of six cases at Home's Favourite, a bakery.

MOH said it is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection among people who worked at the premises at units #04-08 and #04-09 at 15 Jalan Tepong, which is in the vicinity of Jurong Fishery Port.

As epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at the premises, Home's Favourite will be closed from Jul 29 to Aug 12 for deep cleaning.

All staff members will be placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine, added MOH.

The other new clusters reported on Wednesday have a total of three or four cases each.

More cases have also been linked to existing clusters. Ten more cases have been linked to Samy’s Curry Restaurant, taking the cluster’s total to 38, while the Westlite Juniper Dormitory cluster now has at 11 infections.

The cluster linked to a cleaner at Punggol Primary School has grown to seven cases.

In response to queries by CNA, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education said on Thursday morning that two contract cleaners, one non-teaching staff member, one teacher and two students from the school have tested positive for COVID-19.

96,singapore,FTAs don't give 'unfettered access' to Singapore's labour market; policies must benefit Singaporeans: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE: In implementing Singapore's foreign worker policy, the Government's approach is based on whether it will help Singaporeans, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Tuesday (Jul 6).

He was explaining the challenges and trade-offs of Singapore's foreign workforce policies in a ministerial statement, in response to a series of questions filed by several Members of Parliament.



Non-Constituency MPs Leong Mun Wai and Hazel Poa from the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) had asked for data on the number of foreign nationals and their dependants from countries that Singapore has free trade agreements (FTAs) with.

Associate Professor Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asked a similar question on the number of visas granted to intra-corporate transferees (ICT) and professionals under the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).

ICTs are employees of multinational companies who are transferred from overseas offices after working for at least a year in the firm. Companies that want to fill a role with an ICT are not required to advertise the job on MyCareersFuture before submitting the work pass application.



Dr Tan said that none of Singapore's FTAs gives ICTs ""unfettered access"" to the country's labour market, and they all have to meet the work pass criteria set by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

""The ICTs themselves are subject to additional checks on their seniority, employment history, and work experience. They are also subject to more conditions in their eligibility to bring in dependants, whether they want to apply for permanent residency or future employment in Singapore,"" he said.

NUMBER OF WORKERS ENTERING THROUGH FTAS ""VERY SMALL""

In 2020, there were 177,000 Employment Pass holders in Singapore. Among them, there were about 4,200 ICTs, of which around 500 were from India, said Dr Tan.

""The PSP has made Indian nationals coming in through CECA a focus of contention. But I am afraid they have been barking up the wrong tree,"" he added.

""The number of ICTs coming in under our FTAs, and in particular CECA, is a very, very small number relative to the total number of EPs. I suggest we set aside this red herring and move on to the heart of the matter.""



Since becoming an NCMP, Mr Leong has repeatedly questioned the Government's foreign worker policies and whether CECA allows workers from India to displace Singaporeans' jobs.

Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam had in May invited Mr Leong to put up a motion to debate the issue in Parliament. On Jun 22, Mr Leong said in a Facebook post that the PSP will be ""seeking further information from the Government at the parliamentary sitting in July in preparation for the coming debate"" before deciding on a suitable time to file a motion.



""The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) feels strongly that the time to rebalance the interests of the Singaporeans vis-à-vis foreign PMETs (defined as all the work pass holders) in the job market is long overdue,"" he wrote on Jun 22.

WHY PROPORTION OF WORKERS FROM INDIA HAS GONE UP

One of PSP's questions was about the profile of Singapore's work pass holders and their dependants - from China, India, the United States and Australia - and the jobs they commonly hold.

Dr Tan said such statistics are not published for foreign policy reasons, but that he will share some numbers to ""address misconceptions"" and allow for a meaningful debate.

The top nationalities that comprise around two-thirds of EP holders have been consistent since 2005 - and they are from China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and the UK.



The proportion of EP holders from India has increased from about 14 per cent in 2005, when CECA was signed, to 25 per cent in 2020.



The increase is not because of more favourable treatment for Indian EP holders due to CECA, but it is due to the global demand and supply of tech talent, Dr Tan explained.

""China and India, over the last decade or so, are two of the largest suppliers of tech talent. But, you would have read, China has sprouted so many unicorns and the PRC companies themselves have a huge demand of their own, so many Chinese talent decide to stay in China to work,"" said Dr Tan.

""India’s talent, on the other hand, they've continued to look outwards. They've also the advantage of being English speaking. This phenomenon is not unique to Singapore. It is global.""

""SOCIAL FRICTIONS, ANXIETY""

Dr Tan acknowledged that an increasing concentration of these workers could ""cause some social frictions and anxiety to Singaporeans"".

When a single nationality becomes too prominent, that can have ""a disproportionate impact"" on Singapore's existing culture, or cause Singaporeans to feel less at home in their workplaces or neighbourhoods, he said.

""We have to bring in the talent and the skills to keep our economy growing, while tracking that the number of foreigners in our midst stays at a level that we are able to cope with, and manage the social frictions that will arise from time to time.""



MOM takes note of firms that has a concentration of a certain nationality and puts them on the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist, then the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) engages them to review their hiring practices, Dr Tan added.

He said that MOM will be looking to complement and strengthen the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist, and ""exploring refinements"" to the EP framework as announced by MOM earlier.

Dr Tan said: ""The heart of the matter is this. How do we, as a small country devoid of any natural resources, remain open to global talent, for us to continue to create opportunities for Singaporeans, while, at the same time, managing the attendant social repercussions?""

Singaporeans have three concerns, he noted. First, that the growth in EP holders has come at the expense of local PMEs; second, that some workplaces have become more concentrated with a single nationality; and third, that there may be discrimination against local job seekers and employees.

On competition from foreign PMEs, Dr Tan said that Singapore has one of the best talent pools in the world but it is insufficient to meet the needs of all the investments here.

MORE JOBS CREATED FOR SINGAPOREANS THAN FOREIGNERS: DR TAN

In response to questions from Ms Poa, Assoc Prof Lim and Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh), Dr Tan gave further details on the number of EPs issued by sector. EPs are given to foreign professionals, managers and executives who earn at least S$4,500 a month.

As of 2020, manufacturing and construction account for about one-tenth of EP holders here.

The rest are in the services sector. Within the top three sub-sectors, Infocomm and Professional Services account for around one-fifth (19 per cent) each, while the finance industry accounts for another 15 per cent.

From 2005 to 2020, the total number of EPs has increased by around 112,000. But over the same period, the number of local PMEs went up by more than 380,000, Dr Tan said.

""There have been questions asked, both inside and outside of this House, whether most of the growth in local PME jobs was accounted for by Singapore citizens. If you look at our unemployment statistics, we provide the figure for Singapore citizens. The citizen unemployment rate over the past 10 years has been consistently low at around 3 per cent, hence the answer must be a 'yes',"" Dr Tan said.

""For those who have asked how much of this local PME job growth has gone to 'born and bred' Singaporeans, notwithstanding the divisive intent of this kind of questioning, let me state simply that the majority of this growth over this past decade went to Singaporeans born in Singapore.""



Dr Tan noted the attention on the finance and infocomm sectors, which accounted for 40 per cent of the increase in EPs. ""But what is even more significant is that these two sectors saw even stronger job creation for local PMEs,"" he pointed out.

In infocomm, the number of EPs increased by around 25,000, but the number of jobs created for local PMEs was 35,000. In finance, the number of EPs increased by around 20,000 but is outnumbered by the jobs created for local PMEs at around 85,000.

""We focused on these two sectors because they bring good quality jobs, and Singapore ... can carve out an advantage and value-add significantly in these areas. As a result, there has been significant job creation,"" said Dr Tan.

""As we attract foreign banks and infocomm companies to create jobs here, they inevitably need foreign workers, to complement the Singaporean workforce.""



He added that it's a ""misconception"" to think that if foreign workers leave, the jobs they would have taken will all go to Singaporeans.

""How do I know that this is a misconception? Because today, even as we speak, we still have about 22,000 PME jobs that are not filled. Companies are desperate to fill these jobs; they would love to take in Singaporeans if they could, because Singaporeans are more productive.

""But these jobs, up to now, are still not filled. Perhaps Mr Leong would like to think deeply about that, and deliberate and offer us some advice,"" said Dr Tan.

","Dr Tan said that none of Singapore's FTAs gives ICTs ""unfettered access"" to the country's labour market, and they all have to meet the work pass criteria set by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).
Among them, there were about 4,200 ICTs, of which around 500 were from India, said Dr Tan.

SINGAPORE, July 20 (Reuters) - Singapore will halt restaurant dining and ban gatherings of more than two people for one month from Thursday, the health ministry said, as a further rise in coronavirus cases deals a blow to the country's reopening plans.

The restrictions will be reviewed in two weeks as the country nears its milestone of vaccinating two-thirds of its population by Aug. 9.

New coronavirus cases almost doubled on Monday from the previous day and Ong Ye Kung, the health minister, said 184 new infections were expected to be confirmed on Tuesday.

He said vaccinations had been completed for half the city-state's population.

The government is pushing to boost take-up rates among the elderly, where 30% remain unvaccinated.

Singapore's daily new case numbers are only a fraction of those reported elsewhere in Southeast Asian, but the tightening of measures just days after easing them is a setback for an Asian business hub eager to move on from the pandemic.

""We have to make this pre-emptive tightening so that we can cut back on our overall activity levels and slow down the transmission,"" said Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the coronavirus taskforce.

""The objective now is to buy us time so that we can vaccinate more people, especially our seniors.""

Once the situation stabilises, Singapore will have more lenient measures for those vaccinated, Wong said.

Singapore has ramped up testing after clusters of infections at karaoke KTV bars and a fishery port.

The KTV cluster has caused public anger and questions over policing of the lounges notorious for facilitating prostitution and gambling. They were temporarily allowed to operate as restaurants.

The government has said enforcement agencies were stretched.

Singapore has reported more than 63,000 coronavirus infections overall, the bulk of those linked to outbreaks in migrant workers dormitories last year.

99,singapore,Singapore aims to start quarantine-free travel by September,"SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - Singapore is looking to allow quarantine-free travel for those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 from September, when 80% of the city-state's population should be inoculated, the government said on Monday.

Singapore will establish travel corridors with countries or regions where COVID-19 is under control, and those who are vaccinated may not have to quarantine or may be allowed to isolate at home, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said.

The city-state is also set to review whether to loosen curbs in early August, when two-thirds of its population would be fully inoculated.

""The easing will be differentiated and extended to only vaccinated persons, because they are much better protected against the effects of the virus,"" Wong said. ""If you want to go out to dine in the restaurant or workout in the gym, you have to be fully vaccinated.""

Last week, the country tightened social curbs, including halting restaurant dining and banning gatherings of more than two people for one month, after a rise in infections.

More than half the country has received both doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) or Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines. It has inoculated nearly 75% of its 5.7 million people with at least one dose, the world's second-highest rate behind the United Arab Emirates, a Reuters tracker shows.

As countries with advanced vaccination campaigns prepare to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, their focus is turning to preventing death and serious diseases through vaccination.

Still, Singapore may not do away with all of its social distancing measures. For example, it may remove its mask mandate for outdoors, but require people to keep them on in an indoor enclosed environment, Wong said.

As of July 25, Singapore had 1,537 active cases, with 12 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen, and two patients in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU). None of the 14 cases is fully vaccinated.

100,singapore,"Post-pandemic world will be different, but Singapore's fundamental goals don't change: Lawrence Wong","SINGAPORE - As different as the post-pandemic world may look, Singapore's fundamental goals - staying valuable to the global economy and building a fairer and more inclusive society - remain the same.

This was the message Finance Minister Lawrence Wong sought to get across on Tuesday (July 27), in his speech wrapping up nearly five hours of debate on the Government's latest support package for businesses and workers affected by the Covid-19 restrictions.

Life will be different from what it used to be, with greater uncertainty and volatility to be expected, Mr Wong told the House.

""So, we must continue this important work of transforming our economy, and equipping our people with the skills they need in an age of change,"" he said.

""As we transition to this new normal, we must go beyond support measures towards building strength and resilience for the future. We must continue to invest in growing our economy, strengthening our society and greening our home.""

He was responding to suggestions and views after 25 MPs spoke on two rounds of support measures, announced in May as well as last Friday, to help workers and businesses cope with two rounds of tighter restrictions that were imposed following spikes in Covid-19 infections.

At present, several emerging global trends threaten Singapore's value proposition as a hub economy, Mr Wong said. Countries are moving to reshore their production activities, while a growing consensus on a global minimum tax rate is likely to blunt the impact of Singapore's own tax incentives for foreign firms.

Like Venice after the Middle Ages, these external developments could spell decline for Singapore, he warned.

Mr Wong, who visited Venice earlier this month for a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting, recounted how the Italian city had once been a vital trading hub, but failed to adapt to changes in the wider world. With the invention of ships that could sail for months without ever making landfall, traders bypassed Venice and the city-state fell into decline.

""What happened to Venice can happen to Singapore, too, if we are not careful,"" he said. ""We must never take our hub status for granted. We must continue to stay open and double down on our connectivity as a trusted hub for commerce, trade and talent.""

As rapid technological change causes waves of disruption, Singapore must continually strengthen its value proposition of being a gateway to Asia and the wider world, he added.

To do this, it will work to anchor more start-ups and nurture innovation here. At the same time, existing companies will have to relook their business models.

For instance, Singapore is currently considered an established base for the aviation industry in terms of engine maintenance, repair and operations. ""But we cannot assume that this lead is going to be with us forever,"" Mr Wong said.

With the industry shifting towards sustainable fuels, the country must actively pursue new opportunities for growth and help its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) develop the capabilities to partner larger firms in the aviation ecosystem.

""This process of restructuring and transformation is vital to keeping our economy vibrant and strong,"" Mr Wong added. ""And so the focus of our support measures will over time shift from providing pain relief, as we are now, to building deep capabilities for companies to innovate and transform.""","Life will be different from what it used to be, with greater uncertainty and volatility to be expected, Mr Wong told the House.

101,singapore,"Vaccinated people make up 75% of recent COVID-19 cases in Singapore, but few fall ill","SINGAPORE, July 23 (Reuters) - Vaccinated individuals accounted for three-quarters of Singapore's COVID-19 infections in the last four weeks, but they were not falling seriously ill, government data showed, as a rapid ramp-up in inoculations leaves fewer people unvaccinated.

While the data shows that vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases, it also underscores the risk that even those inoculated could be contagious, so that inoculation alone may not suffice to halt transmission.

Of Singapore's 1,096 locally transmitted infections in the last 28 days, 484, or about 44%, were in fully vaccinated people, while 30% were partially vaccinated and just over 25% were unvaccinated, Thursday's data showed.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

While seven cases of serious illness required oxygen, and another was in critical condition in intensive care, none of the eight had been fully vaccinated, the health ministry said.

""There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected,"" the ministry said, adding that all the fully vaccinated and infected people had shown no symptoms, or only mild ones.

Infections in vaccinated people do not mean vaccines are ineffective, experts said.

""As more and more people are vaccinated in Singapore, we will see more infections happening among vaccinated people,"" Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

""It is important to always compare it against the proportion of people who remain unvaccinated...Suppose Singapore achieves a rate of 100% fully vaccinated...then all infections will stem from the vaccinated people and none from the unvaccinated.""

Singapore has already inoculated nearly 75% of its 5.7 million people, the world's second highest after the United Arab Emirates, a Reuters tracker shows, and half its population is fully vaccinated.

As countries with advanced vaccination campaigns prepare to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, their focus is turning to preventing death and serious diseases through vaccination.

But they are grappling with how to differentiate public health policies, such as mask wearing, between the vaccinated and those who are not.

Both Singapore and Israel, for example, reinstated some curbs recently to battle a surge in infections driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, while England lifted almost all restrictions this week, despite high caseloads.

""We've got to accept that all of us will have to have some restrictions, vaccinated or not vaccinated,"" said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital in the Australian capital.

""It's just the restrictions are likely to be higher for those unvaccinated than vaccinated people, but that may still mean they have mask mandates indoors, for instance.""

The Singapore data also showed that infections in the last 14 days among vaccinated people older than 61 stood at about 88%, higher than the figure of just over 70% for the younger group.

Linfa Wang, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, said elderly people had been shown to have weaker immune responses upon vaccination.

In Israel, which also has a high vaccination rate, about half of the 46 patients hospitalised in severe condition by early July had been vaccinated, and the majority were from risk groups, authorities said. read more

It was not immediately clear if the Singapore data reflected reduced protection offered by vaccines against the Delta variant, the most common form in the wealthy city state in recent months.

Two doses of vaccine from Pfizer (PFE.N)-BioNTech (22UAy.DE) or AstraZeneca (AZN.L) are nearly as effective against Delta as against the previously dominant Alpha variant, according to a study published this week. read more

Singapore uses the Pfizer and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines in its national vaccination programme.

Friday's 130 new locally-transmitted infections were off this week's 11-month high. The recent rise in cases prompted authorities to tighten curbs on social gatherings in the push to boost vaccinations, particularly among the elderly. read more

104,singapore,Singapore unveils one of the world's biggest floating solar panel farms,"SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Singapore unveiled on Wednesday one of the world's largest floating solar panel farms, spanning an area equivalent to 45 football fields and producing enough electricity to power the island's five water treatment plants.

The project is part of efforts by the land-scarce Southeast Asian city-state to meet a goal of quadrupling its solar energy production by 2025 to help tackle climate change.

Located on a reservoir in western Singapore, the 60 megawatt-peak solar photovoltaic (PV) farm has been built by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sembcorp Industries (SCIL.SI).

The solar farm could help to reduce carbon emissions by about 32 kilotonnes annually, comparable to taking 7,000 cars off the roads, according to a joint statement by the company and Singapore's national water agency PUB.

As opposed to conventional rooftop solar panels, floating ones perform between 5% to 15% better because of the cooling effect of the water, and are not impacted by shading from other buildings, according to a presentation on the project.

The electricity generated from the 122,000 solar panels on the 45-hectare (111.2 acres) site should make Singapore one of the few countries in the world to have a water treatment system fully powered by sustainable energy.

To allay concerns about the environmental impact of such projects, PUB said an assessment was conducted before installing the solar panels to ensure there was no significant impact on wildlife or to water quality.

""It was carefully designed to improve airflow and allow sunlight passing through the water (to reach aquatic life),"" said Jen Tan, a regional head at Sembcorp Industries.

The solar panels are designed to last for 25 years and drones will be used to assist with maintenance.

Currently, there are four other floating solar panel projects underway in Singapore.

106,singapore,MOH investigating case of 16-year-old who suffered cardiac arrest nearly a week after COVID-19 vaccination,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Jul 5) it is investigating a case of a 16-year-old boy who suffered cardiac arrest six days after receiving his first dose of COVID-19 vaccination.

MOH said it was alerted to the incident by Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) on Jul 3.

The boy was treated at the hospital that day after he collapsed at home in the morning, following weightlifting at the gym.

He was subsequently transferred to National University Hospital (NUH), where he is in critical condition at the intensive care unit.

MOH said the teenager received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine on Jun 27. He was assessed by trained healthcare workers to be suitable for the vaccination, was observed on-site for about 30 minutes after vaccination and was well.

He was also well for the following five days after vaccination, said the ministry.



""Prior to his collapse on Jul 3, he did weightlifting at the gym. MOH understands that he trains with very heavy weights which were above his body weight,"" said the ministry.



“We are in contact with the medical team in NUH who are providing close medical care for the patient. The preliminary diagnosis of his condition is an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinical and laboratory tests are in progress to understand the underlying cause,"" it added.

“We will also work with the medical team in NUH to determine if this might be linked to his COVID-19 vaccination. This will include a thorough consideration of whether there was acute severe myocarditis, which is severe inflammation of the heart muscles affecting the heart function, as a possible diagnosis.""



The expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination will monitor the outcome of the investigation.

AVOID STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY A WEEK AFTER VACCINATION

In a separate statement on Monday, the expert committee said people who have been vaccinated, particularly adolescents and men under 30 years old, should avoid exercise or strenuous physical activity for a week after any dose of the jab.

This is an update from a previous advisory to avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after the second dose. The new advice was made given “emerging data on the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” observed after vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, said the expert committee.

Vaccinated people should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats, said the committee.



It added that those who are diagnosed with myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not receive further doses of the vaccine.



""While most persons with vaccine-related myocarditis observed locally and internationally have mild symptoms and make an uneventful recovery, it is possible that the condition may be aggravated by factors or strenuous activities that may affect the heart,"" said the committee.

Following ""extensive deliberation"", the expert committee said it continues to recommend mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for all eligible individuals, including adolescents and younger men.

The protective benefits from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the vaccination risks and vaccinations should continue to remain voluntary, it added.

“COVID-19 is likely to become endemic in Singapore and around the world. Even with high vaccination rates in our population, settings with low overall levels of vaccination will continue to be susceptible to outbreaks.

“The risk of transmission and outbreak in settings such as schools or workplaces where there is close contact amongst individuals will likely be higher. Infection of unvaccinated individuals can lead to severe disease and long-term complications, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,” said the committee.



It added that the use of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore is of “paramount concern” and that it will continue to monitor local and international data to ensure the country’s vaccination recommendations are up to date based on the latest scientific evidence available.



12 CASES OF MYOCARDITIS OR PERICARDITIS FROM ALL DOSES

In a separate update on Monday, HSA said it received a total of 6,606 reports of suspected adverse reactions from the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines as of Jun 30.

This represents 0.12 per cent of all doses administered in Singapore.

Out of this, 252 reports were assessed to be serious, including 12 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis.

Seven cases of myocarditis and pericarditis involved men aged below 30. This exceeded the expected numbers for this age group based on background incidence rates, said HSA.

“Although there is a small increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, the local incidence rate remains low,” said the agency, at 0.22 per 100,000 doses administered overall. The figure for men below 30 is 1.24 per 100,000 doses.

“All the cases in the younger age group below 30 years old responded well to treatment and had recovered or were discharged well from the hospital,” said HSA.

HSA also said that out of about 32,000 people with a history of anaphylaxis who became eligible to receive the mNRA vaccines, about 13,000 have been vaccinated.

Authorities had on Jun 5 recommended that people with a history of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions to other drugs, food or insect stings can be inoculated with the vaccines.

The overall anaphylaxis incidence rate remained similar to that reported before the new recommendation came into effect, said the agency.



HSA’s safety update on the vaccines covers the two mRNA shots that are part of Singapore’s national vaccination programme. It does not include data on the Sinovac vaccine that is available under the Special Access Route.

MOH said it is working with the People’s Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test kits to people who had visited selected markets and food centres in the last 14 days.

This is part of the ministry's investigation into cases of COVID-19 infection involving markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the markets and food centres.

The collection will run from Jul 26 to Jul 27 July at Residents’ Committee Centres in the vicinity of two new markets - Geylang Bahru Market and Food Centre and 146 Teck Whye Avenue Market.

LIKELY TO SEE HIGH NUMBER OF CASES IN COMING DAYS: MOH

MOH said the overall number of new cases in the community has increased from 324 in the week before to 1,056 cases in the past week.

""We are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community,"" it added.

The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 24 cases in the week before to 136 cases in the past week.

A total of 524 cases are currently in hospital, with most well and under observation.

There are now 12 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and two in critical condition in the intensive care unit. None of the 14 cases is fully vaccinated.

Seven people above 60 years old, who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill, said MOH.

""There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent serious disease when one gets infected,"" said the ministry.

""Over the last 28 days, 15 local cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed away. Six are unvaccinated, nine are partially vaccinated and none was fully vaccinated.""

There were also eight imported cases, who were placed on stay-home notice or isolated upon arrival. Four of these infections were detected upon arrival in Singapore, while four developed the illness during their stay-home notice or isolation.

In total, Singapore reported 125 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday.





An 83-year-old woman died from complications due to COVID-19 on Saturday, becoming Singapore's 37th fatality from the disease.

The Singaporean woman was unvaccinated and was linked to the 121 Bukit Merah View cluster, the Health Ministry said.

In a video posted on social media on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged senior citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19, assuring them that the vaccines are safe.

“Don’t wait till it’s too late,” Mr Lee said. “Most people your age are already vaccinated, including many of your friends and neighbours. Protect yourself, and your family too.”

As of Sunday, Singapore has reported a total of 64,179 COVID-19 cases and 37 fatalities from the disease.

108,singapore,National Day Rally 2021: Read Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech in full,"These racist incidents remind us how fragile our harmony is. But they do not negate our multi-racial approach, which has worked well for us. Racial harmony did not happen spontaneously in Singapore. It took hard work, sacrifice and wisdom. Our founding fathers resolved to forge one nation from the different races. They made multi-racial equality and harmony a fundamental principle of nation building. They did not suppress the distinct identities of each group. Instead they acknowledged and accommodated them. Everyone in Singapore could practise their own beliefs, festivals, religions, and cultures. English, not Chinese, became our working language, so that no race would be privileged over the others.

At the same time, we preserved the mother tongues. We retained Malay as our national language and continued singing Majulah Singapura with gusto in Malay. Over time, the different ethnic groups reached a balance. We did this not through push and shove, but through mutual compromise and give and take. No group got everything it wanted. Each gave up a little in order for all to live harmoniously side by side.

As a result, Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where people of different races and faiths live peacefully together and have done so now for more than half a century. It is a rare and precious achievement but it is also a delicate balance because a harmonious, multiracial country is not a natural or stable state of affairs I does not happen by itself and it does not stay there by itself.

Look around the world. Many countries set out professing the same noble ideals.

But over time, their race relations and politics polarise. Often, the majority group asserts its power and sidelines the minorities. The minorities find themselves with less and less space, and feel no choice but to push back hard. Sometimes, the minorities pursue aggressive identity politics and the majority group feels pressured and threatened, and rallies around hardline chauvinist leaders. It happens to countries much older than Singapore. Either way, the outcome is unhappy, for both majority and minorities. And once a country has gone down that path, it is very difficult to turn back.

Fortunately, right from the beginning, Singapore chose a different path for ourselves.

Nevertheless, 56 years is a very short time in the history of nations. Our racial harmony is still work in progress, and will be so for a long time. We all take pride in Singapore's multiracial identity but all of us still retain at least some racial or religious preferences. We make friends more easily with others who are of the same race, or share our own religion. We mostly choose life partners who are the same race, although that is changing. All this is human, and natural in every society.

But sometimes, it goes beyond racial and cultural preferences to become biases and prejudices. Then it is a problem. Some job advertisements require people who speak Chinese, yet it is not always clear whether this is a genuine necessity for the job or a polite way to signal that the employer is more comfortable with Chinese workers. Or you are looking to rent a flat, you call the property agent, he finds out you are not Chinese, then he says sorry, the owner doesn't want to rent to you after all. If he is polite he stops there. If he is direct, he will tell you why.

These things do happen here. The minorities experience it more acutely, because they are the ones most affected by such racial discrimination. They feel angry, hurt, disappointed that the words in our National Pledge are still an aspiration, but still not fully achieved. I know it is harder to belong to a minority race than to the majority. This is true in every multi-racial society but it does not mean we have to accept this state of affairs in Singapore.

We must keep on working at it, to become one people, regardless of race, language or religion. The majority must be more sensitive to the concerns of the minorities and we must also have the moral courage to take a stand against racist behaviour. To express clear disapproval of racist incidents when they happen. That is not so hard but what is harder, to call out deliberate racist agitation that masquerades as something else. Like the campaign against CECA, which claimed to be about putting Singaporeans first, but had a strong racial undertone.","Racial harmony did not happen spontaneously in Singapore.

110,singapore,NDR 2021: Singapore to enshrine into law workplace anti-discrimination guidelines,"“They hire from their own countries, using familiar links and old boys’ networks, rather than openly on merit and they give foreigners the jobs and opportunities, and only make token gestures with locals. That naturally causes problems.”

Government agencies deal with these transgressions firmly, he said, adding that interventions by agencies are “quiet, but effective”.

Mr Lee added that there is a need to assure Singaporeans that Employment Pass and S Pass holders are of the “right standard”.

He said that “a practical and reasonable indication of quality, the standard, is how much the employer is prepared to pay for the work pass holder”.

Therefore, to qualify for an Employment Pass or S Pass, there are salary cut-offs, which have risen in tandem with the rise in Singaporeans’ wages, Mr Lee said. Last year, the authorities raised the cut-offs twice, he noted.

For the financial sector, where salaries are higher, Singapore set a higher cut-off, he said.

Singapore will continue to tighten the criteria for Employment Passes and S Passes over time, although not suddenly or sharply, which would hurt businesses, but gradually and progressively, Mr Lee said.

“This will ensure that work pass holders come in where we most need them and we won’t be flooded with more than we can absorb, doing jobs for which Singaporeans are qualified and available.”

SIMILAR APPROACH TO DISPUTES OVER SALARIES, WRONGFUL DISMISSAL

While “writing TAFEP guidelines into the law is a major move” philosophically, as it signals that Singapore does not tolerate discrimination at workplaces, Mr Lee said that in practice, Singapore hopes to operate in a similar way as today, “except better”.

“We should still resolve workplace disputes informally and amicably, if at all possible. The legal redress should be a last recourse, one which is seldom needed,"" he said. Its existence will cause parties to work harder to settle the dispute, through conciliation and mediation,” he added.

The approach towards disputes over discrimination will be modelled on how companies deal with disputes over salaries or wrongful dismissal.

“In such disputes, conciliation and mediation have to be tried first. Only when those fail, does the matter go before an Employment Claims Tribunal, which will arbitrate and decide the case.”

A tribunal will similarly be created to deal with workplace discrimination, he said.

“This will protect workers against discrimination based on nationality. It will also prohibit other kinds of discrimination covered by TAFEP. Women will get better protection and discrimination based on age, race, religion, and disability will also be disallowed,” he said.","Mr Lee added that there is a need to assure Singaporeans that Employment Pass and S Pass holders are of the “right standard”.

111,singapore,Singapore raises 2021 economic growth forecast as Covid vaccination progresses,"People walk and cycle on a bridge leading away from the Merlion statue in the Marina Bay area of Singapore on Saturday, 22 May 2021.

SINGAPORE — Singapore's government raised its official growth forecast for 2021 after the economy held up stronger than expected in the first half of the year as the domestic Covid-19 situation stabilizes.

The Singapore economy is now expected to grow between 6% and 7% this year, the trade and industry ministry said Wednesday. That compared with the previous official projection range of 4% to 6%.

""Barring a major setback in the global economy, the Singapore economy is expected to continue to see a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, supported in large part by outward-oriented sectors,"" the ministry said in an economic update.

""The progressive easing of domestic and border restrictions as our vaccination rates continue to rise will also help to support the recovery of our consumer-facing sectors and alleviate labour shortages in sectors that are reliant on migrant workers,"" it added.","People walk and cycle on a bridge leading away from the Merlion statue in the Marina Bay area of Singapore on Saturday, 22 May 2021.

112,singapore,Covid-19 vaccination milestone of 80% may see further easing of restrictions: Experts,"SINGAPORE - Covid-19 restrictions could be eased further, now that eight in 10 people have been fully vaccinated, although loosening would have to be in phases as there are still unvaccinated people at risk, said experts.

Professor Dale Fisher, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the National University Hospital (NUH), said on Sunday (Aug 29) that while crossing the milestone of having 80 per cent of the population vaccinated is a ""remarkable achievement"", there is no need to rush to lift restrictions all at once, as the phased reopening strategy has been working.

""We have waited for the vaccine to lead us out of the pandemic, and now we need to let it do so and trust that the high immunity levels will do their job. There is no appetite to be rash and have a freedom day with removal of all restrictions at once,"" he said.

He noted that Singapore has to take some ""bold steps"", now that the majority of people are vaccinated.

""I can see it will be hard to let go of many activities, but mass testing of asymptomatic vaccinated people and quarantining those who test positive impact the economy and people's mental health,"" said Prof Fisher.

""Fundamentally, we need to get more comfortable with not identifying every case and focus on protecting the vulnerable rather than identifying every case and stopping spread.""

On Aug 6, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said one of the criteria for moving on to the second phase of the country's four-stage plan towards becoming Covid-19-resilient and reopening was an 80 per cent vaccination rate.

Singapore is currently in the first stage, a preparatory phase which is expected to last until early September, during which some border restrictions are being eased.

Singapore will then move into the second stage, known as ""transition stage A"", which would see further economic reopening. But this is premised on a high vaccination rate and stable overall situation, with no surges that threaten to overwhelm the healthcare system, Mr Wong said.

Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that Singapore's healthcare system is ""very much in control"" of the situation, despite the recent Covid-19 outbreaks at Bugis Junction and North Coast Lodge workers' dormitory, as well as the number of Covid-19-related deaths this month.

The number of cases hospitalised with severe disease and requiring either oxygen or intensive care is stable, he said, and higher case numbers have not translated to rising demand for advanced hospital care.

""This is exactly the evidence that shows vaccination is able to reduce the severity of Covid-19 infection, and with high vaccination uptake in the population, we are well poised to relax restrictions even further,"" said Prof Teo.

Professor Paul Tambyah, a senior infectious diseases consultant at NUH, expressed similar sentiments. He said: ""The important thing is that the impact on our society and healthcare system, despite having around 100 new locally transmitted cases daily for the last few days, has been minimal, with few patients in ICU (intensive care unit) or dying every day, thanks to our high vaccination rates.""

He said that restrictions on family visits, dormitory residents and dining at hawker centres and coffee shops should be loosened, as these ""appear to be causing among the greatest hardship to the largest number of people without a really significant impact on public health"".","SINGAPORE - Covid-19 restrictions could be eased further, now that eight in 10 people have been fully vaccinated, although loosening would have to be in phases as there are still unvaccinated people at risk, said experts.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination have evaluated the need for booster shots, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Friday (Sep 3).

Having reviewed the available evidence and scrutinised the safety and efficacy of booster doses administered globally, the committee has recommended, and MOH has agreed, to start a booster programme for these groups of people.

Seniors are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection and may develop a lower immune response from their two-dose vaccination regimen, said MOH. This is coupled with the expected decline of their immunity over time, as many were vaccinated earlier, added the Health Ministry.

They should receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine about six to nine months after having completed their primary course of vaccination regimen.

This is to ""ensure higher levels of protection from infection and continued high levels of protection against severe disease, and reduce the possibility of spikes in infections and more people falling severely ill"", said MOH.

About six months have passed since the first batch of seniors aged 60 and above completed their second doses in March under the national vaccination programme.

They will be eligible for the third dose within this month, said MOH, adding that more details on the implementation of the booster shot will be announced later.

Immunocompromised persons have a ""blunted immune response"" to vaccination, and are also at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, said the Health Ministry.

""These individuals are recommended to receive a third dose of the same mRNA vaccine two months after their second dose as part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure that they start off with an adequate protective immune response to vaccination,"" said MOH.

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that immunocompromised individuals will be contacted by their doctors.

Mr Ong added that with new variants, there have been more breakthrough infections despite vaccinations, and that the strength of protection decreases as antibodies wane over time.","SINGAPORE: Singapore will offer COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, as well as people aged 60 and above, and residents of aged care facilities.

In an update on Monday (Sept 6), Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, co-chairman of the multi-ministry task force handling the Covid-19 situation in Singapore, said the new testing regime will buy time for Singapore to roll out its vaccine booster programme for seniors.

On the possibility of boosters for younger adults as well, he said: ""This will not only protect them but also help to slow down transmission and further reduce the R value."" The R value measures the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.

Mr Wong noted that the high vaccination coverage has allowed Singapore to keep the incidence of severe illnesses and deaths low among vaccinated individuals.

However, unvaccinated individuals remain susceptible, with cases doubling to more than 1,200 cases last week, up from 600 cases in the week before.

""Thus, we need to take quick action now to dampen the increasing likelihood of an exponential increase in cases,"" he said.

""This will also buy us time to get more people, in particular seniors, vaccinated as soon as possible, and also to roll out our booster programme to those aged 60 and above.""

The measures are meant to help slow down transmission without having to go back to a state of heightened alert, or a circuit breaker, which are ""last-resort measures"", though they should not be ruled out entirely, added Mr Wong.

The number of unvaccinated seniors above 60 years old is around 94,000, with the numbers continuing to drop as around 500 seniors are getting their jabs each day, he said.

The booster programme is on track and will be rolled out according to the planned timeline, said Mr Wong.

Singapore will give its first Covid-19 vaccine booster shots - to seniors aged 60 and above, residents of aged-care facilities, and those whose immune systems are compromised - from this month.

SINGAPORE — Singapore has refrained from tightening social-distancing measures even as the highly infectious delta variant has driven Covid-19 cases up sharply, while the country shifts to a long-term strategy of living with the coronavirus. ""This rapid and exponential rise in daily infections that we are experiencing now is what every country that seeks to live with Covid-19 has to go through at some point,"" Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said at a media briefing Friday. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates globally, with 81% of the population fully vaccinated, data from the health ministry showed. Cases have been rising rapidly, from an average of 76 a day a fortnight ago to 288 a day in the past week, the ministry said in a Friday statement. At the current trajectory, the number of cases could soon reach 1,000 per day, it added.

But the number of serious cases has remained low. As of Thursday, there were 26 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation and seven critical cases in intensive care units, said the health ministry. Still, the city-state wants to limit the number of deaths from Covid and avoid overwhelming its hospitals, said Ong. That's why the government is not opening up the economy further for now, added the minister. ""Practically every country that has gone through this kind of transmission wave has suffered hospital collapses and high death tolls — we want to avoid that,"" said Ong. He added that if the country can achieve that, it will not have to return to a ""long, hard lockdown.""","Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates globally, with 81% of the population fully vaccinated, data from the health ministry showed.

124,singapore,Can we live with COVID-19? Singapore tries to blaze a path,"Singapore – Only 60 people in Singapore have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic first emerged, and some 82 percent of its population is now fully vaccinated against the disease.

In June, the government announced it would move towards a “living with COVID-19” strategy, focusing on tracking and treating outbreak clusters with vaccinations and hospital admissions – but without the strict lockdowns, border closures, and work-from-home orders that have been the defining feature of much of the pandemic across the world.

That month, it began the gradual easing of its coronavirus curbs, but the weeks since have laid bare the challenges of moving from pandemic to endemic.

Relaxed restrictions have sent cases soaring. Reopening plans have been delayed and some restrictions have been re-imposed, giving lockdown-weary Singaporeans a renewed sense of deja vu.

After months of relatively low numbers of daily new cases, over the weekend Singapore reported crossed the 1,000 mark for new daily cases, the highest since April last year.

Health officials found 1,012 new cases on Sunday, up from 1,009 new cases on Saturday. There were 873 patients in the hospital on Sunday (up from 863 on Saturday), with 118 serious cases requiring oxygen support (up from 105 on Saturday), and 21 in critical condition in the intensive care unit (up from 18 on Saturday).

The government has called the increase a “rite of passage” as the island nation adapts and adjusts its hoped-for model of living with – as opposed to eradicating – the virus and its variants.

“We are on a path of transition to a new normal of living with COVID-19,” Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told a virtual press conference on Friday. “It is a journey that is uncertain and full of twists and turns.”

Public hospitals are seeing a surge in the number of patients but the vast majority – more than 98 percent – are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, so health officials are now urging them to go to a general practitioner or clinic to free up hospitals for urgent care.

On Saturday, health officials expanded home recovery as the default care management model for fully vaccinated COVID-19 patients aged 12 to 69 without severe symptoms. Seven in 10 patients are expected to qualify for home recovery under the new scheme, which is designed to relieve the pressure from growing caseloads on hospitals, intensive care units, and the healthcare community’s capacity to cope with what feels like an endless battle.

Dr Ong Eu Jin Roy, a family physician in Singapore, says medical workers are nearing exhaustion.

“We’ve been enduring, but there has to be an endpoint where we can see the goal post,” Ong said. “When the government wants us to open up and be endemic, I think that’s great, because really we are reaching the end of our limits. You cannot be in a heightened alert state where the adrenaline is going every day that you go in. It cannot go on.”

‘Back to basics’

In addition to boosting the capacity of medical services to handle increased cases, Dr Steven Tucker credits the country with expanding services to help residents cope with mental health issues and COVID-induced stress, from anxiety over personal safety to rent relief for food and beverage outfits forced to close under lockdown orders.

“The stressors that are affecting everyone, as variable as they may be, are: ‘Am I going to get sick. Is my family member sick? Am I going to need to quarantine? Do I have access to care?” Tucker, an American-trained oncologist living and practicing in Singapore since 2006, told Al Jazeera.

“All of this amounts to a mental health stress that Singapore has responded very quickly to, acknowledged, and has made efforts to address,” Tucker added.

Dr Ong says the country of 5.7 million has not yet reached the endemic stage, where the virus becomes something people routinely live with, like the flu.

“I would say it’s endemic when half our friends have it, or have had it,” Ong told Al Jazeera. “Right now maybe one in 10 or one in 20 of our friends have had it. In my circle, it’s only my relatives who have had it. None of my friends have had it.”

But even when the virus poses severe risks only to the vulnerable and unvaccinated, living with COVID-19 will mean the many precautions that Singaporeans have taken – including wearing face masks, social distancing, working from home, eating at home, and limits on inbound travellers – are likely to stay for the foreseeable future, Ong said.

He also sees booster shots as having a place in Singapore’s ongoing coronavirus strategy as variants arise, as well as daily or weekly rapid tests at work, until the pandemic comes under control everywhere in the world and the virus gradually loses its potency.

Among the reasons for Singapore’s high vaccination rates is that the country makes it hard to do things – such as being allowed into restaurants or other public places – without being fully vaccinated.

“Singapore has done relatively well, with widespread testing, tracking, vaccinations, and broad adherence to government policies,” Jeannette Ickovics, a professor of public health and psychology at Yale-NUS College in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. “These practices and policies will continue here, because the global epidemic persists with more infectious variants and an anemic global vaccine rollout. It is a basic principle of public health that all are vulnerable if any are vulnerable; therefore, we must remain vigilant.”

She added, “How do we live with COVID-19? Go back to basics: wash your hands, wear a mask, convene outdoors, socially distance, if not feeling well stay home. Try to streamline your work, evaluate and articulate what you need to get it done, and embrace flexibility.”

Following the rules

Juliana Chan, a media entrepreneur, says she appreciates how much work has gone into the effort to keep the virus from spreading. Her daughter was placed on quarantine when a classmate came down with COVID-19 and her son had to take a leave of absence from school as well.

“We were visited regularly at our home either in person or by video call, and we received texts and calls daily,” Chan told Al Jazeera. “It is a mammoth exercise to run contact tracing at scale, and I was very impressed by the professionalism of all the staff involved.”

Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University, says decisive leadership has been aided by Singaporeans’ willingness to follow government instructions such as mask-wearing, which also was common during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

“Singapore’s experience has demonstrated the need for not just a whole-of-government but a whole-of-society approach to dealing with the pandemic,” Tan told Al Jazeera. “While Singapore has benefitted from a cooperative citizenry, the use of technology for contact tracing has been critical too in keeping the pandemic under control.”

Although some in the business community complain privately that it is time to allow more cross-border travel freedoms, many say Singapore’s handling of the pandemic has helped its status as a key centre for global business.

“If anything, Singapore has become even more attractive as a hub for global and regional business in the past two years,” Steven Okun of consulting firm McLarty Associates told Al Jazeera. “For example, as a result of both US-China trade tensions and the need for more resilient supply chains given the pandemic, businesses from both China and the US see Southeast Asia as a critical market.”

While Singapore’s vaccination rate is among the world’s highest, the country is still trying to convince sceptics to go for the jab.

On Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, already vaccinated nearly eight months ago, received a COVID-19 booster jab, and shared a photo and video with a message to fellow seniors.

“Cases are increasing rapidly. A booster jab will strengthen your protection against COVID-19,” Lee said on Facebook.","Singapore – Only 60 people in Singapore have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic first emerged, and some 82 percent of its population is now fully vaccinated against the disease.

127,singapore,Singapore hopes US and China can find ways to move forward despite their differences: Vivian Balakrishnan,"SINGAPORE - Competition between major powers is inevitable, but constructive competition and cooperation are possible, necessary and beneficial for all countries, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Tuesday (Sept 14).

He noted that in recent months, US-China tensions have generated some discomfort and unease among countries in the region.

""Nobody wants to be forced to choose sides. For us, we hope that both the US and China will find a modus vivendi in the conduct of their relations, open channels of communication, manage tensions and frictions as and when they arise, and find a way to move forward despite their differences,"" he added.

Dr Balakrishnan was speaking at a joint press conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tanglin with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Singapore for a two-day working visit that ended on Tuesday.

Dr Balakrishnan said he was glad to hear from his counterpart that China seeks a cooperative relationship with the United States, as an equal.

""Both the US and China have strategic interests in this region, and are key economic partners with all members of Asean,"" he said.

Dr Balakrishnan added that Singapore welcomed the recent phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden.

""We hope that these discussions will continue, and will auger a new trajectory for a healthy relationship between the two powers. Ultimately, we would like to see the two biggest economies in the world coexist peacefully, and in an open and inclusive regional architecture throughout Asean, and this will be win-win for all of us,"" he said.

The ministers were also asked whether they saw recent high-level visits, such as US Vice-President Kamala Harris' visit to Singapore in August and Mr Wang's ongoing visit to the region, as part of diplomatic competition between the China and the US.

Mr Wang said there are some countries that are not accustomed to China's development. ""It has created some concerns and even misjudgments towards China,"" he said, adding that this would affect the development of bilateral relations.

""The US may be in a such a situation. From China's point of view, we hope that the US can be like other countries, including Singapore, and understand that in this world, the US is not the only one with the right to develop, but other countries also have this right,"" he added.

Mr Wang also spoke of China's commitment to multilateral cooperation.

He said he and Dr Balakrishnan agreed that given the global uncertainty and the pandemic situation, the international community needs to work together, more than before.

Mr Wang added that it is necessary to promote mutual cooperation and discard the zero-sum approach of the past.

The world cannot be built upon one or a few developed countries, while other countries remain in poverty, he said, adding that this was unfair and unethical.","SINGAPORE - Competition between major powers is inevitable, but constructive competition and cooperation are possible, necessary and beneficial for all countries, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Tuesday (Sept 14).

128,singapore,"Singapore joins US, EU in lifting flight ban on Boeing 737 Max planes","SINGAPORE - Singapore's aviation authority has lifted a flight ban on Boeing 737 Max planes that was imposed more than two years ago.

The 737 Max had been banned from commercial operations in Singapore in March 2019 after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia involving the aircraft.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Monday (Sept 6) said it has lifted the restrictions on the 737 Max after completing its technical assessment.

This comes after other aviation authorities - such as those in the United States and the European Union - earlier lifted restrictions on the plane.

The CAAS said it had evaluated the design changes made to the aircraft by Boeing, which were approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other validating authorities.

""CAAS also reviewed the operational data of flights of the aircraft that had resumed service over the past nine months and observed that there have been no notable safety issues,"" it added.

The 737 Max was grounded by aviation authorities worldwide after two crashes in five months - from October 2018 to March 2019. A total of 346 people were killed.

Investigations pinpointed a faulty flight handling system known as the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) as a principal cause in both crashes.

Meant to keep the plane from stalling as it ascends, the automated system had instead forced the nose of the plane downwards.

Boeing has made changes to the system and also to the plane, such that flight crews are ""likely never to experience a situation that would activate MCAS"".

CAAS has issued a directive for operating the aircraft, in line with the lifting of restrictions.

It requires airline operators that operate the 737 Max in Singapore to implement a set of measures, including establishing a specific flight crew training programme. Pilots have to go through additional simulator sessions to ensure they are adequately trained to handle aircraft emergencies.

SIA is the only one of the three local airlines which has the 737 Max, with six of such aircraft in its fleet.

CAAS said SIA must prove that it has implemented all required actions before it can use the plane for commercial operations.

Foreign airlines intending to operate the 737 Max will have to comply with a range of safety requirements as well.","SINGAPORE - Singapore's aviation authority has lifted a flight ban on Boeing 737 Max planes that was imposed more than two years ago.

SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Singapore has started trialing robots to patrol public areas and deter poor social behaviour in its latest effort to further augment its strong portfolio of surveillance tools.

Ranked one of the safest countries in the world, Singapore has put two autonomous robots on trial to detect bad behaviour such as flouting of COVID-19 safety measures, smoking in prohibited areas and the improper parking of bicycles, Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency said in a statement on Sunday.

It said the two patrol robots, named Xavier, are equipped with cameras that can detect bad social behaviour and trigger real-time alerts to the command and control centre.

The trial is taking place at an area with high foot traffic in central Singapore.

The agency said that during the three-week trial, the robots would be used for surveillance and displaying messages to educate the public on proper behaviour. A spokesperson from the agency said on Monday the robots would not be used for law enforcement during the trial.

""The deployment of Xavier will support the work of public officers as it will reduce the manpower required for foot patrols and improve operation efficiency,"" the agency said.

Singapore's home affairs minister, K Shanmugam, said in August the city-state aimed to have more than 200,000 police cameras by 2030, more than double the current number of cameras deployed across the island state in Southeast Asia.

130,singapore,Rugby: HSBC Singapore Sevens cancelled for second straight year due to Covid-19,"SINGAPORE - The HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens has been cancelled for the second year in a row due to Covid-19, Sport Singapore said on Friday (Sept 3).

The national sports agency added it made the collective decision with World Rugby and their partners to call off the Oct 29-30 event. SportSG said it remains committed to bringing back the tournament next April ""subject to the improvement of the global pandemic situation"".

Among the reasons cited for the cancellation were global travel restrictions, quarantine protocols in Singapore and participating countries as well as prevailing safe management measures on event days.

""Past editions have always been remembered as a fun family sport and entertainment event for all,"" said the organisers. ""Unfortunately, under the circumstances, we would be unable to create that experience and continue to run a successful large-scale event for the fans, players, officials.""

This year's tournament was initially planned for April before it was pushed back because of the coronavirus.

When it was last held in 2019, the event featured 16 teams and attracted 57,000 fans to the National Stadium.

Besides the Singapore leg, those in Hong Kong (November), Paris (October) and Cape Town (December) have also been cancelled.

The 2021 series has been shortened to two stops in Canada, starting in Vancouver from Sept 18-19 before concluding in Edmonton a week later. In past seasons before the virus, there were typically 10 stops.

The 2022 campaign will kick off with a pair of tournaments in Dubai. The Nov 26-27 round will be held behind closed doors followed by the Dec 3-4 event with fans in attendance.

The Singapore Sevens is one of several marquee events the Republic hosts annually, including football's International Champions Cup (ICC), golf's SMBC Singapore Open and the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix.

All three did not feature this year while other competitions like the Singapore Badminton Open (June) and the Singapore leg of the Fina Swimming World Cup (August) were also dropped this year.

133,singapore,10-hour debate in Parliament over foreign competition in job market ends past midnight,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's answer to foreign competition in the local job market cannot be to shut its doors and turn away investors. Instead, the country has to - and will - invest in its people, working to mitigate the downsides of an open economy and striving for growth that will benefit all.

This was the gist of a 10-hour parliamentary debate that ended past midnight, during which four political office-holders rebutted the Progress Singapore Party's (PSP's) assertion that the Government's foreign talent policy has cost citizens jobs.

Finance Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged that an open economy has its downsides, even though the vast majority benefit.

""In the end, the government has the responsibility to govern and to make policy decisions in the best interest of all Singaporeans,"" he said. ""Some decisions will not be so popular, even though we are convinced they are necessary, and must proceed for the good of all.""

They were debating the issue of jobs and foreign talent, which PSP Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai and Mr Wong had filed motions on. The minister said he asked to speak as Mr Leong's proposed topic falsely attributed the challenges Singapore faces to free trade agreements (FTAs) and foreigners.

This was why the Government had sought ""to explain and reiterate our position on this important matter,"" he added. ""It is important Singaporeans - and the world - understand where we stand.""

The minister sharply criticised the racist and xenophobic undertones in the PSP's rhetoric on foreign talent - an allegation the opposition party has repeatedly denied. ""Look - if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it is a duck,"" Mr Wong said, adding that such irresponsible politics will divide society and spell disaster for Singapore.

Mr Leong had urged the Government to take ""urgent and concrete"" action to restore balance in the job market - starting by raising qualifying salaries for work pass holders and imposing a monthly levy on Employment Pass (EP) holders.

A lengthy exchange ensued between Mr Leong and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who pressed Mr Leong for his position on various issues, including his support for FTAs such as the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) with India.

He also sought to get Mr Leong to admit that other Singaporeans, like some PSP members, might see his views as racist.","SINGAPORE - Singapore's answer to foreign competition in the local job market cannot be to shut its doors and turn away investors.

Many governments and central banks around the world are exploring the use of CBDCs, which are digital forms of existing currencies. Some, like China, are trialing retail-focused CBDCs designed to replicate cash in circulation, while others are considering using so-called wholesale CBDCs to improve the internal workings of their financial systems.

Most projects are still in the early stages and are domestically focused, but developing global rules and frameworks for how CBDCs can be used internationally is complicated technically, and potentially politically.

This latest project aims to develop prototype shared platforms for cross-border transactions using multiple CBDCs, said the statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank Negara Malaysia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the South African Reserve Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Innovation Hub, which is leading the scheme.

These platforms would enable financial institutions to transact directly with each other in CBDCs, which could eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the time and cost of transactions.

The initiative, which will also explore different technical, governance and operating designs, should publish its results in early 2022, the statement said.

""The multi-CBDC shared platform ... has the potential to leapfrog the legacy payment arrangements and serve as a foundation for a more efficient international settlement platform,"" Bank Negara Malaysia's assistant governor Fraziali Ismail said in the statement.

138,singapore,"Singapore to extend vaccinated travel lane scheme to eight more countries, including US, UK, Spain","SINGAPORE: Singapore is extending its vaccinated travel lane scheme to eight more countries, allowing those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter Singapore without having to serve quarantine.

From Oct 19, fully vaccinated travellers from Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States will be able to enter Singapore under this arrangement, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced on Saturday (Oct 9).

This expansion is being conducted in a ""cautious and step-by-step manner"" to help ""reclaim and rebuild"" Singapore's status as an international aviation hub with global connectivity, said CAAS.

The latest announcement comes after the ""experience and confidence gained"" from the first two vaccinated travel lanes with Brunei and Germany, which were launched last month, it added.

It also comes a day after Singapore announced another vaccinated travel lane with South Korea.

Speaking during a press conference on Saturday, Transport Minister S Iswaran said the vaccinated travel lanes would restore ""two-way quarantine-free travel"" between Singapore and the eight newly announced countries.

He added that the airlines and Changi Airport, together with various government agencies, had gained ""valuable experience"" through the implementation of the two existing vaccinated travel lanes over the past month.","SINGAPORE: Singapore is extending its vaccinated travel lane scheme to eight more countries, allowing those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter Singapore without having to serve quarantine.

139,singapore,"Singapore's new 'vaccinated travel lanes' won't significantly increase risks, minister says","Singapore is set to open ""vaccinated travel lanes"" with more countries — but that doesn't mean the country is taking on significantly higher risks, Transport Minister S. Iswaran told CNBC on Monday. The city-state announced last week that it will be launching more travel lanes for vaccinated travelers from South Korea, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S. That's in addition to similar arrangements with Germany and Brunei that started in September. The initiative allows quarantine-free travel for those who are vaccinated, but travelers will have to take Covid-19 tests to ensure they are not infected with the virus before entering the country. Singapore will look into similar travel arrangements with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and ""many other countries"" in the region next, he added.

Reopening international travel

Iswaran, who is also Singapore's minister-in-charge of trade relations, said the country's existing initiative with Germany and Brunei picked up only two cases of infected travelers — out of 3,000 people who entered Singapore through the so-called VTLs in the first month. ""So when you combine that with the vaccination requirement as well, actually the vaccinated travel lanes and the cross border flows that we're facilitating do not increase the risk that we are taking as a country … significantly at all,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""

We are finding paths to open up international aviation in a safe way and reclaim and rebuild Singapore's status as an international aviation hub. S. Iswaran Singapore transport minister

Iswaran was responding to some criticism online that the city-state's plans to reopen international travel seemed at odds with its decision to impose some new restrictions within the country. Singapore on Saturday said it will tighten some Covid restrictions, aimed at protecting the vulnerable, such as the elderly and unvaccinated. Those who are not vaccinated will no longer be allowed to enter malls, and even those vaccinated will be subject to a limit of two people when entering malls. The minister pointed out that the VTLs demonstrated that only a limited number of infected cases were entering the country, but community infections have risen far more quickly — with a ""significant proportion"" spread through community activities.

On a ""risk assessment basis,"" there's a need to limit some of those activities while allowing economic and general activity to continue ""to the extent possible,"" while also imposing some ""important constraints,"" Iswaran said. As of Oct. 9, 83% of the population has completed two doses of a Covid vaccine. However, the number of cases started spiking after some restrictions were loosened, and hit daily record highs last week to hover above 3,000. Last month, Singapore authorities tightened Covid measures again in a bid to blunt community transmissions and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. The country has also started encouraging those infected with Covid, who are exhibiting mild symptoms, to self-isolate where possible.

Singapore aims to reclaim global aviation hub status

Iswaran said that the launch of the vaccinated travel lanes was part of efforts to reestablish the city-state as an international aviation hub. Pre-pandemic, Singapore's Changi Airport was among the busiest in the world and handled 68.3 million passengers in 2019. However, that dropped more than 80% to only 11.8 million passengers in 2020, according to local media.","Singapore is set to open ""vaccinated travel lanes"" with more countries — but that doesn't mean the country is taking on significantly higher risks, Transport Minister S.

140,singapore,Singapore to extend vaccinated travel lane scheme to Australia and Switzerland,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will extend its quarantine-free vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme to Australia and Switzerland from Nov 8.

For Australia, however, two-way travel applies only to fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families due to its current border measures, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Tuesday (Oct 26).

""Singapore’s VTL for Australia will allow fully vaccinated travellers from Australia to enter Singapore without quarantine, for all purposes of travel,"" said CAAS.

Australia has said it intends to reopen to more travellers in future.

""We also expect student and business pass holders from Singapore to be able to enter Australia, after Australia has finalised the arrangement for their entry,"" said CAAS on Tuesday.

""Other travellers from Singapore would not be able to travel to Australia until a later stage.""

Under the vaccinated travel lane scheme, travellers must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries in the last 14 days before departure to Singapore.

They must take two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - before departure and on arrival at Changi Airport - and enter Singapore via designated flights.

Unvaccinated children aged 12 and below are allowed to travel under the scheme - except to South Korea - as long as they are accompanied by a traveller who meets the requirements.","SINGAPORE: Singapore will extend its quarantine-free vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme to Australia and Switzerland from Nov 8.

143,singapore,Singapore hospitals risk being ‘overwhelmed’ after record daily Covid deaths,"Singapore’s healthcare system is at risk of being “overwhelmed” by surging coronavirus infections, government officials warned on Wednesday, a day after the city-state expanded quarantine-free travel as it shifts its approach to dealing with the pandemic.

The health ministry reported 18 deaths on Wednesday – Singapore’s highest toll in a single day – and 3,862 more cases, just shy of the record 3,994 tallied the day before.

“At the current situation, we face considerable risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed,” Lawrence Wong, co-chair of a government taskforce fighting Covid-19, said before the new figures were released.

Wong, who is also the finance minister, said nearly 90% of isolation beds in hospitals have been filled and more than two-thirds of intensive care unit beds are occupied.

His comments come a day after the city-state expanded its quarantine-free travel to fully vaccinated passengers from eight countries, including key trading partners the United States, Britain and France.

The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has said the global business hub cannot remain closed indefinitely, and the city-state has shifted from a zero-tolerance strategy with lockdowns and closed borders to taking the approach of living with Covid-19.

Analysts said the travel lane scheme, which started with Brunei and Germany last month, could provide a shot in the arm for the pandemic-hammered airline and tourism industries. But it nevertheless stirred fears among some ordinary Singaporeans as the city grapples with its latest outbreak.

Most of Singapore’s cases are mild or asymptomatic with patients recovering at home, allowing hospitals to focus on seriously sick Covid patients.

“We are trying to add capacity, but it’s not simply a matter of having extra beds or purchasing new equipment because ... our medical personnel are stretched and fatigued,” Wong said.

“And while we are trying to reinforce the team, it will take time for these reinforcements to come in.”

Taskforce co-leader and health minister, Ong Ye Kung, said the number of infections among unvaccinated people aged 60 years and above “continues to be high”, accounting for two-thirds of patients in the ICU and those who have died.

Singapore has reported more than 158,000 coronavirus cases and 264 deaths.

The recent spike in infections after the relaxation of some restrictions has prompted Singapore to pause further reopening.

The city-state extended its social curbs on Wednesday to contain the spread of Covid-19 for around a month in order to ease the pressure on the healthcare system.

More than 80% of Singapore’s total population has been vaccinated against the virus.

144,singapore,Singapore parliament debates bill to tackle foreign interference,"Summary Experts raise concerns over broad measures in bill

Singapore says it is vulnerable to foreign interference

Discussions, advocacy by Singapore citizens not covered -govt

SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Singapore's parliament began discussion on Monday of a proposed law to counter foreign interference that has sparked concern from opposition parties, rights groups and experts about its broad scope and limits on judicial review.

The small and open city-state, which says it is vulnerable to foreign meddling, targeted fake news with a far-reaching law in 2019, and joins nations such as Australia and Russia that have passed laws in recent years to deter foreign interference.

It allows authorities to compel internet, social media service providers and website operators to provide user information, block content and remove applications, and is likely to be passed, as the ruling party has a majority in parliament.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

But some critics say its broad language risks capturing even legitimate activities, while rights group Reporters Without Borders said the law could ensnare independent media outlets.

""The pre-emptive powers ... and broad scoping of provisions could potentially provide the government with significant wherewithal to curb legitimate civil society activity,"" said Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University.

""FICA has the makings of being the most intrusive law on the statute books,"" he said of the bill, to be formally known as the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act (FICA).

In response to a Reuters query, the home ministry said the bill did not cover discussion or advocacy by Singapore citizens, or the vast array of their collaborations with foreigners.

But orders can be issued if a citizen acts for a foreign principal in a manner contrary to the public interest, it added, saying the law set out clear thresholds.

The bill lets the home minister order investigations in the public interest to ""expose hostile information campaigns"", based on suspicion of foreign interference.

Instead of open court, an independent panel, chaired by a judge, will hear appeals against the minister's decisions, a move the government says is necessary as matters may involve sensitive intelligence with implications for national security.

GROWING THREAT

As use of social media and communications technology increases, experts and opposition parties have agreed on the need to counter a growing threat of foreign interference in domestic affairs.

Critics have said Russia's 'sovereign internet' 2019 law allows authorities the discretion to limit access to resources and information, while Australian laws target lobbyists for foreign countries.

In parliament on Monday, Singapore home minister K. Shanmugam pointed to examples of spurts in online activity over the years 2016 and 2017 as well as 2018 and 2019 that aimed to influence sentiment or create artificial impressions of Singapore's positions, but he did not name any countries.

In 2016, Singapore went through a choppy period in ties with China over Taiwan and the disputed South China Sea, while 2018 saw it embroiled in a dispute over airspace and maritime boundaries with neighbouring Malaysia.

Singapore's bill is unique in targeting foreign interference through the internet as well as individuals, but not as extensive as U.S. or Australian laws on transparency and regulation of individuals, Chong Ja Ian, a political analyst at National University of Singapore.

Besides aiming to remove content that threatens immediate and significant harm, it imposes obligations on those considered ""politically significant persons"", who are directly involved in Singapore's political processes, such as MPs.

Others may be included in the category if their activities are directed towards a political end, however.

The main opposition Workers' Party has called for changes to the draft law, such as narrowing the scope of executive powers to reduce the chance of an abuse of power. read more

Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had said the bill would not apply to foreign individuals or publications ""reporting or commenting on Singapore politics, in an open, transparent and attributable way.""

Rights groups had warned the 2019 law on fake news could hurt freedom of expression. The government said legitimate criticism and free speech are unaffected.

145,singapore,Singapore to investigate ‘unusual’ surge in COVID-19 cases,"Recent spike in infections after relaxation of some restrictions has prompted the city-state to pause further reopening.

Singapore’s health ministry has said that it is looking into an “unusual surge” in infections after the city-state reported 5,324 new cases of COVID-19 — the most since the beginning of the pandemic.

Singapore also recorded 10 new deaths from the disease on Wednesday, increasing the toll to 349.

“The infection numbers are unusually high today, mostly due to many COVID-positive cases detected by the testing laboratories within a few hours in the afternoon,” the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Wednesday night.

“MOH is looking into this unusual surge in cases within a relatively short window, and closely monitoring the trends for the next few days.”

As of Wednesday, a total of 20,895 people in Singapore are recovering from COVID-19 in their own homes. Meanwhile, 4,589 are in community care facilities and 849 are in treatment facilities, while 1,777 are in hospital for observation, the MOH statement added.

Data from the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed that there has been a sharp rise in the number of cases in the dormitories.

The 818 cases in the dormitories reported on Friday was a jump from the 452 registered on Thursday, 448 on Wednesday and 515 on Tuesday.

Friday’s daily tally surpassed the previous daily high of 2,478 that was recorded the day before.

This means that the increase of 431 cases was dominated largely by the dormitory cases, which went up by 366 in a day.

Among the new locally transmitted cases are 556 patients who are aged above 60, MOH said in its daily update on the coronavirus situation.

There are 1,356 patients who are in hospital, four fewer than the day before.

Of these, 222 patients require oxygen support to help them breathe, up from the 204 the previous day.

The number of patients under intensive care has remained at 34 since Sept 29.

Of those who have fallen very ill, 214 are patients aged over 60.

Eight more deaths were also reported on Friday, bringing the tally to 103 so far.

Singapore has logged a total of 99,430 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic last year.

MOH said that over the last 28 days, the percentage of local cases who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms is 98.2 per cent.

During the same period, 471 cases required oxygen aid and 52 had been warded in intensive care units

Of these, 51.1 per cent were fully vaccinated and 48.9 per cent were not vaccinated or partially vaccinated

Over the last 28 days, 45 people have died, of whom 26.7 per cent were fully vaccinated and 73.3 per cent were not vaccinated or partially vaccinated

CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING

Among large clusters that are being closely monitored by the ministry, 10 had new cases, with a total of 168 new infections added on Friday.

Of the 10 clusters, eight are foreign worker dormitories.

VACCINATIONS

As of Sept 30, 82 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, and 85 per cent has received at least one dose.

A total of 9,204,856 doses of Covid-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme (Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty and Moderna) have been administered.

So far, 4,594,491 people have received at least one dose of vaccine under the national vaccination programme, and 4,487,124 individuals have completed the full vaccination regimen.

MOH added that to date, it has invited about 500,000 eligible seniors to receive their vaccine booster.

It said that 236,849 individuals have received their booster shots and another 111,000 have booked their appointments.

In addition, 198,533 doses of other vaccines such as Sinovac that are recognised in the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing have been administered, covering 101,290 individuals.","SINGAPORE — There was a record 2,909 new cases of Covid-19 in Singapore on Friday (Oct 1), with 2,079 cases in the community, 818 in migrant worker dormitories and 12 that were imported.

She is due to meet with Singapore officials next week to discuss the resumption of cross-border travel between the two neighbours, which she expects to happen as soon as next month.

Malaysia is aiming to reopen its borders to international tourists in November, and visitors from the city state could be among the first to be allowed into the country, she said.

""We are open (to) Singapore as long as Singapore is open to us as well,"" Datuk Seri Nancy told CNBC's Street Signs Asia show on Thursday (Oct 21).

When asked when she expected an arrangement with Singapore might be worked out, she said she was ""very optimistic that it should be by November"".

Prior to the pandemic, a high volume of people crossed the Causeway in Woodlands and the Second Link in Tuas daily to visit families or for work purposes.

Before the border closed in March last year, roughly half a million people from both countries made daily trips between Singapore and Johor.

More than 100,000 Malaysians are estimated to be stuck in Singapore since the borders were closed, and are hoping to be reunited with families back home.

Present cross-border travel with Malaysia is facilitated by the Periodic Commuting Arrangement scheme and the framework for emergency visits in case of deaths or critical illness.

Following Malaysia's reopening of its Langkawi island resort under a travel bubble programme for fully vaccinated domestic tourists last month, more than 128,000 people have travelled to the island by ferry or flight as at Oct 16, Ms Nancy said.

Malaysia on Oct 11 lifted a ban on interstate travel as it transitions to an endemic phase of living with the coronavirus, and has allowed the economy to reopen as its vaccination rate has risen.

The country is currently in the process of administering the Covid-19 vaccination to teenagers, as well as booster shots to high-risk groups.","KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia could be opening up to international tourists including travellers from Singapore ""very soon"", Malaysia's Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Nancy Shukri has said.

149,singapore,161 deaths and a slowdown in reported infection rate: Singapore's COVID-19 situation since the start of new restrictions,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has reported more than 160 COVID-19 deaths in the past three weeks, as the country experiences its worst wave of the pandemic.

There has also been an upward trend in the number of cases who require hospital care, patients who need oxygen supplementation and those in the intensive care unit.

Three weeks ago, the Government tightened restrictions for dining-in and social gatherings in what it called the Stabilisation Phase. The restrictions are expected to be in place until Oct 24.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said then that it would review the measures two weeks after implementation and adjust them based on the community situation.

At a multi-ministry task force press conference on Sep 24 when the new restrictions were announced, co-chair Gan Kim Yong said the ""rapid"" rise in COVID-19 cases was putting a ""serious strain"" on hospital resources.

At the time, he warned that the daily number of cases, about 1,600 then, could double by the next week and increase beyond that if the trend continues.

This follows a review of the COVID-19 situation in these countries, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.

From 11.59pm on Oct 26, travellers (excluding short-term visitors) with a 14-day travel history to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, prior to departure to Singapore will be allowed to enter or transit through the country again.

These travellers will be subject to Category IV border restrictions, which include a 10-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities.

STAY-HOME NOTICE PROTOCOLS SIMPLIFIED

On top of that, Malaysia, Cambodia, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Mongolia, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Seychelles, South Africa, Tonga, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Vietnam, will be placed under Category III measures.

From 11.59pm on Oct 26, all travellers from Category III regions will be able to serve their 10-day stay-home notice at their declared place of residence or accommodation – regardless of the vaccination status and travel history of the traveller and their household members.

Category III travellers currently have to apply to opt out of serving their stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, subject to certain restrictions.

“By default, they will not be allocated accommodation in any dedicated SHN facilities,” said MOH on Saturday.

Returning residents should ensure they can secure alternative accommodation prior to their return if their homes are unsuitable for their stay-home notice, it added.

But the authority added that these travellers must remain in their declared place of residence or accommodation throughout their stay-home notice period, and wear an electronic monitoring device.

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Saturday (Oct 23) that advisories issued by these countries are for their own citizens.

It is to alert them that infection rates here are higher, and to inform them to take precautions.

The advisories do not impact fully vaccinated individuals from Singapore travelling to these countries, he added.

In the past week, Germany and the United States have moved Singapore to their higher Covid-19 risk categories of destinations.

Mr Ong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force handling Covid-19, said that these countries are reflecting the fact that Singapore is going through a big wave of coronavirus spread and therefore infection rates are higher.

But there is a lot of goodwill between such nations and Singapore, noted the minister.

""Everybody has gone through these waves; we all know that it is a rite of passage we have to go through.

""At some point, it will stabilise, it will come down, and we all want to work together - maintain our connections, our people-to-people exchanges,"" said Mr Ong.

154,singapore,Singapore is No. 2 in the world for attracting and developing talent: Insead,"SINGAPORE - Singapore has moved up one notch to second place in a global ranking of how well countries attract, develop, support and retain talent - behind Switzerland but ahead of the United States.

The yearly global talent competitiveness index, which covers 134 countries, is published by French business school Insead and non-profit research body Portulans Institute.

In the same index for cities, Singapore ranked seventh, down from third last year but still the only Asian city in the top ten.

San Francisco topped the city index, followed by Geneva, Boston and Zurich.

For the country ranking, Singapore made it to top three in four of the six criteria, which encompass enabling, attracting, growing and retaining talent, vocational and technical skills, and global knowledge skills.

The Republic was praised for enabling talent with its strong regulatory landscape, attracting talent around specific areas such as bio-nanotechnologies, and growing talent with its strong education quality.

It also excelled in global knowledge skills, and has one of the world's best pools of vocational and technical skills which help Singapore's ability to match labour market demand and workforce supply.

""However, the city state's ability to retain talent remains its main weakness, and more needs to be done to improve issues related to both sustainability and lifestyle,"" the study said.

Indeed, Singapore continues to face challenges in dealing with its manpower crunch, especially in top technology jobs that require highly skilled individuals.

Dr Bruno Lanvin, Insead distinguished fellow and co-editor of the index, told The Straits Times that while Singapore attracts international talent, it does not keep them for very long.

But there is also much that the city state has improved in, he said.

""Singapore's position in formal education has improved, mainly because of greater vocational enrolment and higher tertiary education spending,"" he added.

""It also reflects Singapore's continuous efforts to enhance the quality of its educational system, from coding classes at an early age to problem-solving in primary and secondary education.""

He added that the quality of Singapore's information technology infrastructure has been an asset during the Covid-19 pandemic, as other less-connected economies have been struggling to maintain economic activities in the face of lockdown measures.","SINGAPORE - Singapore has moved up one notch to second place in a global ranking of how well countries attract, develop, support and retain talent - behind Switzerland but ahead of the United States.

157,singapore,Court dismisses claim by drug trafficker facing execution that he has 'mental age of person below 18',"SINGAPORE - The High Court on Monday (Nov 8) dismissed a bid by a 33-year-old Malaysian, who is scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday (Nov 10) for drug trafficking, to escape the gallows.

However, Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam was granted a stay of execution pending a hearing before the Court of Appeal at 2.30pm on Tuesday.

Nagaenthran, who was arrested in 2009 at the age of 21 with a bundle of heroin strapped to his left thigh, had sought to challenge his execution, contending that he had the mental age of a person below 18 years old.

He argued that the execution of intellectually disabled persons is prohibited under customary international law as this amounted to inhuman punishment.

He also claimed the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has an ""internal policy"" not to execute convicts who are mentally disabled - a claim the agency has refuted.

In his oral remarks dismissing the application, Justice See Kee Oon said there was no credible basis for Nagaenthran's assertions as to his mental age.

The alleged mental age was based on the opinion of his lawyer, Mr M. Ravi, who has no medical expertise and has met the prisoner only once, on Nov 2, for 26 minutes, the judge noted.

Justice See reiterated that Nagaenthran has been accorded due process in accordance with the law.

""It is not open to him to challenge the court's findings pertaining to his mental responsibility, whether directly or indirectly, in yet another attempt to revisit and unravel the finality of those findings.""

Nagaenthran's case came under the spotlight late last month when a letter from the SPS to his mother in Ipoh on Oct 26 was circulated on social media.

The letter informed her that the death sentence on her son would be carried out on Nov 10, and that SPS would facilitate extended daily visits till then.

A petition calling for him to be pardoned from the death sentence has since garnered more than 64,000 signatures.

It argued that Nagaenthran should be spared the gallows because he had committed the offence under duress, and had been assessed to have a low IQ of 69.

He was sentenced to death by the High Court in 2010 after being convicted of trafficking 42.72g of heroin.

159,singapore,"Singapore's response to Covid-19 variant Omicron: Too much, too little or just right?","SINGAPORE - When the stakes are very high, it is always better to take possibly unnecessary precautions than to be caught off guard and end up with needless suffering and deaths.

This is what Singapore and the rest of the world are doing with the emergence of Omicron, the latest Covid-19 variant of concern (VOC).

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has very quickly declared it a VOC - less than a month after it was first detected and even before there is enough information to know if it really will be of concern.

The decision was based on the potential for more rapid transmission given the number and location of the spike protein mutations in Omicron that might make it easier for the virus to enter human cells and reproduce.

This is unlike how the WHO dragged its feet in declaring the Covid-19 a pandemic in 2020. That resulted in slower reactions by many countries in dealing with the spread of the virus - and is partially responsible for the more than 5.2 million Covid-19 deaths over the past two years.

One could say the world has learnt from its mistakes and is reacting much faster, just in case, instead of waiting for more information to emerge.

This time, more than a dozen countries, including Singapore, have started closing their borders to visitors from countries where the new variant might be spreading, primarily those in southern Africa.

Entry requirements into Singapore have also been tightened, with all air travellers required to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on arrival.

If there is a positive test result, a ringfence will be thrown around the person and any close contacts, to prevent Omicron from entering the community.

But the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 has stopped short of dialling back the recent relaxation of measures in the community, which now allows people to dine in groups of five, among other things.

It has, however, paused further relaxation while signalling its readiness to act if the situation demands it.

This approach seems well-calibrated as the community measures have only recently been eased. Until Omicron spreads in the community, there is no need to tighten measures, as it can be done quickly if needed.

The obvious questions that arise are: Is Singapore doing too little? Too much? Or is this the best approach?

There are bound to be different opinions, but there will not be a clear answer until some time into the future.","This is what Singapore and the rest of the world are doing with the emergence of Omicron, the latest Covid-19 variant of concern (VOC).

160,singapore,"Spooked by Omicron, Singapore defers expanding reopening plans","A quarantine-free entry policy for vaccinated arrivals in Singapore will not be extended to more countries for now.

Singapore will hold off on more reopening measures while it evaluates the Omicron coronavirus variant and will increase testing of travellers and front-line workers to reduce the risk of local transmission, authorities say.

A quarantine-free entry policy for vaccinated arrivals in the Asian financial and travel hub will not be extended to more countries for now, while current social distancing measures will remain in place, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Tuesday.

“This is a prudent thing to do for now, when we are faced with a major uncertainty,” Ong told a media briefing, adding that the variant had not yet been detected locally.

Singapore will be prioritising the use of COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests produced by Thermo Fisher for travellers. Thermo Fisher said it is able to detect the Omicron variant.

Any Omicron cases found in Singapore will be placed in government healthcare facilities rather than the home isolation so far used for mild COVID-19 cases.

Ong said Singapore’s high vaccination rate should offer some protection against the variant.

Here are details of the measures Singapore will undertake:

From December 3, all air travelers entering or transiting through Singapore must take a Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, test on arrival,

People entering via air Vaccinated Travel Lanes will have to take additional supervised rapid COVID tests on day three and seven after arrival,

Enhanced testing measures for inbound travelers will last initially for a month,

Airport and border front-line workers in contact with travellers from regions affected by Omicron will have to take weekly PCR tests,

Travelers from seven African states who entered Singapore between November 12 and 27 will have to take one-time PCR tests,

Confirmed or suspected Omicron-infected patients will be required to quarantine for 10 days in government facilities.

The measures come at a time when nations around the world are at odds over how to best protect themselves against a variant for which there is little information and that has now been found in locations from South Africa to Spain, Canada and Australia.

For Singapore, a small city-state that has maintained tough restrictions since early in the pandemic, Omicron has raised fears among the population that the government may have to reconsider its approach to border reopenings at a time when general travel is just getting going.

The Southeast Asian nation, which is highly exposed to global trade winds and geopolitics, has been shifting away from a COVID-Zero approach to living with the virus.

With 85 percent of its population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and new infections stabilised, Singapore had recently allowed people from different households to dine together at restaurants and gather socially. It had also gradually extended its vaccinated travel lane programme to more countries before delaying those with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a precaution amid concern about Omicron.","A quarantine-free entry policy for vaccinated arrivals in Singapore will not be extended to more countries for now.

161,singapore,Singapore to start charging Covid patients who are ‘unvaccinated by choice’,"Singapore will no longer pay the Covid-19 medical bills for people “unvaccinated by choice”, the government said, as the country grapples with a surge in cases.

The government currently covers the full Covid medical costs for all Singaporeans, as well as permanent residents and long-term visa holders, unless they test positive soon after returning home from overseas.

However from 8 December, the government said it will “begin charging Covid-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice”.

It said unvaccinated people “make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive in-patient care and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources”.

Covid-related medical bills will still be paid for people who aren’t eligible for a vaccine. The government will also foot the bill for individuals who are partially vaccinated until 31 December, giving them time to get a second dose.

Singapore has among the highest coverage rates in the world, with 85% of the population fully vaccinated.

Yet the city state is struggling with rising Covid infections and last month warned its healthcare system was at risk of being “overwhelmed” by surging cases. It came a day after the country expanded quarantine-free travel as part of a shift in its approach to dealing with the pandemic.

The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, previously said the global business hub could not remain closed indefinitely, and Singapore has moved from a zero-tolerance strategy with lockdowns and closed borders to living with Covid-19.

A spike in infections after the relaxation of some restrictions prompted the island to pause further reopening in late October. Social curbs were extended for around a month in order to contain the spread of Covid and ease the pressure on the healthcare system.

On 8 November, the country reported 2,470 new cases and 14 deaths.

Mr Lee and his Malaysian counterpart Ismail Sabri Yaakob were giving speeches at the Istana on the first day of the land and air VTL between Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Ismail Sabri is on his first official visit to Singapore.

Mr Lee said the aim is to expand the land VTL to include general travellers from the middle of December, taking into account the public health situation. Currently, travellers must be citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders of the country they are entering.

Mr Ismail Sabri said they also spoke about expanding the land VTL to include bus services on the Tuas Second Link, trains operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu, and ""gradually"" personal vehicles such as cars and motorcycles.

The leaders also discussed launching a sea VTL, possibly between Tanah Merah ferry terminal in Singapore and Desaru in Johor, and expanding the air VTL to include destinations such as Penang, Langkawi, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu.

Countries have raced to contain the new Omicron variant amid reports it is potentially more contagious than the current dominant Delta variant. Some have closed borders to foreign travellers or tightened restrictions on them.

Malaysia's Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said on Monday that authorities detected a COVID-19 case through an on-arrival antigen rapid test conducted at the Johor entry point of the Causeway.

Authorities are confirming the positive result using a polymerase chain reaction test, and assessing if passengers who travelled on the same bus need to be quarantined or subjected to other restrictions, Mr Khairy said.","SINGAPORE: Singapore and Malaysia want ""more open borders"" even if the new Omicron coronavirus variant disrupts plans to expand the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) between both countries, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday (Nov 29).

Similarly, up to 1,440 Malaysian citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders in Singapore will also be able to go back home, as part of the initial phase of a much-anticipated land vaccinated travel lane (VTL) between the two countries.

Tickets for the designated land VTL buses go on sale at 8am on Thursday (Nov 25).

Those travelling via the land VTL must test negative using a professionally administered antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within two days of departure.

The test must be done at an accredited laboratory or testing centre.

Those travelling to Malaysia will also need to take an additional supervised on-arrival ART after they clear immigration.

The ride from Singapore will cost $15 for adults and $8 for children, while buses from Malaysia will cost RM20 for adults and RM10 for children (S$6.50 and S$3.30 respectively).

For now, those travelling via the land VTL have to be citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders of the country that they are entering. This includes work pass holders, student pass holders and long-term visit pass holders.

This arrangement is meant to give priority to workers in either country who have not been able to visit their families since the land border was shut in March last year.

SINGAPORE, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Singapore's government is easing some of the tight social curbs it imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, after infections stabilised in the city-state over the past month.

From Monday, limits on social interactions and dining out will be expanded to five people from the current rule of up to two vaccinated people, government ministers told a news conference on Saturday.

They said the overall infection numbers and hospital situation have largely stabilised and improved.

""We are now transiting towards living with COVID-19,"" Gan Kim Yong, minister for trade and industry, told reporters. ""I know many or some prefer to open up more quickly but we must do so in a very careful and step-by-step manner.""

""This means that we will ease some measures, observe, monitor and ensure the situation continues to be under control and stabilised before easing further,"" he said.

Singapore's daily COVID-19 cases have fallen below 3,000 on average. About 85% of the island nation's 5.45 million people have been vaccinated.

The number of infections fell to 1,734 cases on Friday from a record daily count of 5,324 in late October.

Business events in Singapore are already bouncing back.

Singapore hosted top executives of big global companies this week at a host of conferences, marking its gradual return to normalcy and underscoring the contrast with long-time rival Hong Kong, which is sticking with some of the toughest quarantine rules in the world.

Despite all this, compared to Europe, Britain and the United States, Singapore still has tight COVID-19 restrictions, including mandatory mask-wearing in public.

""We will monitor the situation over the next few weeks and if the overall situation remains stable, our healthcare system remains stable, we can consider the next series of moves, say around end of December,"" said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong.

165,singapore,Singapore detects first 2 imported Covid-19 cases who test preliminarily positive for Omicron,"SINGAPORE - Two imported Covid-19 cases have preliminarily tested positive for the Omicron variant on Thursday (Dec 2), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.

Both cases were isolated upon arrival in Singapore on Wednesday, and had no interaction with anyone in the community.

""There is currently no evidence of any community transmission from these cases,"" said MOH in a statement on Thursday.

The ministry added that both cases are currently recovering in isolation wards at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. They are fully vaccinated, and have mild symptoms of cough and scratchy throat.

Both cases arrived from Johannesburg on board Singapore Airlines flight SQ479 on Wednesday.

The first case is a 44-year-old Singapore permanent resident who was travelling from Mozambique and transited in Johannesburg.

He had tested negative for Covid-19 in his pre-departure test in Mozambique on Nov 29.

The second case is a 41-year-old Singaporean woman who travelled from South Africa.

She had tested negative for Covid-19 in her pre-departure test in Johannesburg on Nov 29.

""They had undergone a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore and were immediately conveyed to a stay-home notice (SHN) dedicated facility to be isolated while awaiting their test results,"" said MOH.

166,singapore,Singapore slams border shut just month after setting up quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia,"Singapore will freeze the sale of tickets for arriving flights and buses under its quarantine-free travel program for four weeks from tomorrow, the government said, citing the risk from the fast-spreading Omicron COVID-19 variant.

Under the vaccinated travel lane program, Singapore allows quarantine-free entry for fully vaccinated travellers arriving on designated flights and buses from about two dozen countries including Australia, India, Malaysia, Britain and the United States.

But no new tickets would be issued for people hoping to arrive from any of those countries from Thursday until January 20, the government said on Wednesday.

'Our border measures will help to buy us time to study and understand the Omicron variant, and to strengthen our defences, including enhancing our healthcare capacity, and getting more people vaccinated and boosted,' the Health Ministry said in a statement.

Singapore will freeze the sale of tickets for arriving flights and buses under its quarantine-free travel program for four weeks from tomorrow

Singapore had set up a quarantine-free bubble with Australia just a month ago, but the government has already cancelled the agreement in the lead up to Christmas

The government said it would also reduce the VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel after January 20.

Travellers already holding VTL tickets who meet all other requirements can still travel.

The government also urged people arriving in Singapore to minimise their social interactions, avoid large gatherings and eating out for seven days even if their tests, which they have to take every day for the week, are negative.

Singapore has confirmed 65 imported Omicron cases, along with a handful of local cases.

Omicron has fast become the dominant Covid-19 strain in many countries since it emerged about a month ago, accounting for more than 70 per cent of cases in the US alone.

The variant has been found in Singapore, which has been opening its borders to select countries since October after abandoning a Covid-zero approach still pursued by the likes of China and Hong Kong.

Singapore is the latest country in south-east Asia to suspend reopening efforts in an attempt to buy time against the more transmissible variant after Thailand halted its quarantine-free entry program this week.

In Australia, there's pressure from medical experts to bring back mandatory mask-wearing and density limits, while New Zealand has pushed back the phased reopening of its border until the end of February due to the omicron variant threat.

Government are looking to further 'study' the Omicron variant before re-opening to the world

Singapore is now also instructing people returning from overseas to avoid high-risk mask-off activities such as dining at restaurants or exercising in gyms for seven days after arrival, even if they test negative each day.

Previously, returnees were allowed to move freely once they tested negative.

Singapore's local cases have plunged from a daily high of more than 4600 in late-October to just 221 on December 21, according to Ministry of Health data. Still, imported cases - most of them omicron - are on the rise to more than 50 each day.

169,singapore,"Tel Aviv is world's most expensive city, with S'pore and Paris in joint second","SINGAPORE - Tel Aviv is now the most expensive city in the world to live in, according to an index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

The Israeli city climbed from fifth place last year to head the rankings - the first time it has been in the top spot - after pushing Paris down to joint second place with Singapore.

Singapore rose two spots to dislodge Hong Kong as Asia's priciest city.

EIU data also revealed that price increases are contributing to the fastest rise in the cost of living for city dwellers in five years.

Its index showed that average prices for goods and services have risen 3.5 per cent year on year in local currency terms, compared with an increase of just 1.9 per cent this time last year.

Transport costs rose most rapidly in this year's survey, mainly because of costlier oil driving a 21 per cent increase in the price of unleaded petrol. Combined with fluctuating consumer demand and exchange-rate shifts, the resulting supply problems also fuelled price rises in the world's major cities.

The EIU conducts the survey twice a year, comparing more than 400 individual prices across over 200 products and services in 173 cities.

Data is collected each March and September with researchers surveying a range of stores, including supermarkets, mid-priced shops and higher-priced speciality outlets, as well as an array of service providers.

Items are individually weighted across a range of categories and a comparative index is produced using the relative difference by weighted item.

The study, which is in line with the Singapore Green Plan, will go on until mid-2022, before the companies decide on their next move.

For Woodside, Singapore and Japan would be ideal export destinations for hydrogen from its planned H2Perth Hydrogen facility in Western Australia, while Keppel Data Centres said it is studying the use of hydrogen to power its data centres.

172,singapore,‘I thought I was going to die’: otters attack British man in Singapore park,"A man attacked by a pack of otters in a Singapore park has said that he thought he was going to die during the ordeal.

Graham George Spencer, a British citizen living in Singapore, said he was chased, pinned down and bitten “26 times in 10 seconds” by a family of otters while out for an early morning walk in the botanic gardens.

Spencer told The Straits Times he was approaching the gardens’ entrance on 30 November when he spotted about 20 otters crossing a path in front of him.

The animals were moving quietly but “went crazy” after another man ran towards them, Spencer told the paper. The runner was able to avoid the animals but Spencer was not as lucky.

He said they lunged at him, biting his ankles, legs and buttocks and causing him to fall over.

“I actually thought I was going to die – they were going to kill me,” he added.

Spencer’s friend, who was about “15 paces” away from him, ran up screaming in a bid to scare away the otters.

“I was bitten 26 times in 10 seconds. If it wasn’t for my friend, I don’t think I’d still be here. I’d be dead,” he told local outlet Today.

The pair said they ran towards a visitor centre, still pursued by the otters. After staff at the centre treated some of the wounds, Spencer took himself to nearby Gleneagles hospital where he was given tetanus shots and oral antibiotics.

He said he has returned to the hospital three times to treat his wounds. The attack has cost about $1,200 in medical bills.

After speaking with a representative from the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Spencer said he was told authorities were investigating the incident.

The island is believed to be home to 10 families of otters, or about 90 in total. Driven away by pollution in the 1970s, they have returned as the country’s waterways have been cleaned up in recent years. The Washington Post reports the animals are common sights in hospital lobbies and condominium pools, and have even been seen drinking from public fountains.

Although river otters appears benign, the animals have been known to attack people in the past. In May, a 77-year-old man reportedly was bitten on the leg by an otter while exercising near Kallang River in Singapore.

Residents of Anchorage, Alaska, were confronted by a pack of aggressive otters in September. A spate of reported incidents saw the group attack dogs, children and adults near creeks, rivers and lakes in the area.

Bernard Seah, a member of OtterWatch and the Otter Working Group that track otters in the area surrounding the Singapore Botanic Gardens, said that the family of otters, named the “Zouk family”, were regular visitors to the Gardens and may have bitten Spencer fearing danger.

“Given that it was early morning, it may have been dark and confusing for the otters and (Spencer) may have just been a victim of circumstance,” he told the Straits Times.

Singapore’s national parks board has issued an advisory on what to do during an encounter with an otter. “DO NOT touch, chase or corner the otters. Observe them from a distance. Going too close to the otters may frighten them,” it says.","A man attacked by a pack of otters in a Singapore park has said that he thought he was going to die during the ordeal.

Those aged between 18 to 29 years who have passed five months since completing their primary vaccination jabs will also be able to receive their booster shots from December 14.

The Pfizer vaccine is the first Covid-19 vaccine approved by Singapore for use for children aged five to 11, following a recommendation by the expert committee on Covid-19 vaccination, which the multi-ministry taskforce has accepted.

The committee said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks posed to the young children, especially given the ongoing community transmission and emergence of the Omicron variant.

It recommended children with moderate to severe chronic medical conditions should be given priority to receive the jabs.

The children will be given smaller doses - one-third of that used for those 12 and above - and the jabs will be spaced at least 21 days apart, said the health ministry.

MOH will work with the Ministry of Education and Early Childhood Development Agency to roll out vaccinations for the school-going age group.

Senior Minister of State for Health Dr Janil Puthucheary said in a Facebook post that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) had conducted a thorough evaluation of data in consultation with two groups of experts from HSA’s Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts.

Based on the data, Dr Puthucheary said the “benefits outweigh the risks for use in the young”.

He said: “In an ongoing study of over 2,000 children aged 5 to 11 years, vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 90.7%. In addition, side effects such as injection site pain, fatigue, headache, chills and fever were generally reported less frequently and were milder in severity in the children compared to adolescents...

178,singapore,"448 Omicron cases in S'pore to date, new cluster linked to The Vinyl Bar on River Valley Road","SINGAPORE - An Omicron cluster of 10 cases linked to The Vinyl Bar in River Valley Road has been detected.

All 10 are fully vaccinated and have mild or no symptoms, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Dec 25).

MOH is ringfencing the cases through contact tracing, the statement said.

The primary case in the cluster is a traveller who arrived in Singapore on Dec 14 from the United States on a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flight, MOH said.

The traveller's on-arrival test was negative for the virus but he tested positive for Covid-19 on Dec 18, said MOH.

On Dec 15, the traveller met a colleague, who two days later visited The Vinyl Bar at 266 River Valley Road.

Epidemiological investigations found that this was when the colleague likely transmitted the virus to a staff of the bar, as well as to three patrons who were at the bar that evening.

One of the patrons then infected four household members.

Staff and visitors of The Vinyl Bar who have been identified as close contacts of the new cases will be placed on quarantine, said MOH.

As a precautionary measure, staff and visitors who were at the bar at the same time as the traveller's colleague on Dec 17 will be contacted by MOH for a one-time targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

Meanwhile, all visitors to The Vinyl Bar are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit.

""They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell,"" said MOH.","SINGAPORE - An Omicron cluster of 10 cases linked to The Vinyl Bar in River Valley Road has been detected.

179,singapore,Dormitory-bound work pass holders cannot enter Singapore via vaccinated travel lane: MOM,"SINGAPORE - From 11.59pm on Saturday (Dec 4), employers of all S Pass and work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sector will not be allowed to make new applications for workers to enter Singapore via vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs).

This will also apply to employers of other dormitory-bound work pass holders, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said on Saturday.

These workers should enter Singapore via ongoing industry initiatives - such as programmes with upstream testing and isolation in the source country - or the Work Pass Holder General Lane.

The entry of workers under these lanes is done at a pace where they can be safely onboarded before entering high-risk settings like dormitories and worksites, said MOM in a statement. For instance, workers have to show verification of vaccination and go for medical examination under these lanes.

Workers who had obtained approval before Saturday to enter Singapore via VTLs will still be allowed to do so. However, they will need to take an on-arrival Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction test and self-isolate while waiting for the results. Those who test negative will go through a five-day onboarding programme.

More details will be communicated to the employers.

In its statement on Saturday, MOM noted that Malaysian and female work pass holders will still be allowed to enter Singapore via VTLs.

MOM said: ""This is because (these) individuals generally do not reside in dormitories.""

MOM's statement comes after it announced in October that it would resume entry approvals for migrant domestic workers and work permit holders from the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors on the condition that they are fully vaccinated.

This follows its announcement in May that it would stop accepting new applications from higher-risk countries or regions due to Covid-19 with immediate effect.

As a result of manpower shortages in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors, a pilot was launched in July to bring in migrant workers from India to alleviate the situation.

According to the Singapore Contractors Association Limited, the Association of Singapore Marine Industries and the Association of Process Industry, the number of work permit holders in these sectors has declined by more than 15 per cent or 60,000 since end-2019.

The three associations said in July that these restrictions have resulted in project delays and significant labour cost increase, which in turn affect the viability of businesses.

""Besides delays in housing and infrastructure projects, which have implications for home owners and Singaporeans, there are implications for Singapore's global competitiveness, credibility of our businesses and locals employed in these sectors when projects are not delivered on time or terminated,"" they added.","SINGAPORE - From 11.59pm on Saturday (Dec 4), employers of all S Pass and work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sector will not be allowed to make new applications for workers to enter Singapore via vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs).

HONG KONG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Singapore affiliate of Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said on Monday it will withdraw its local licence application and wind down its digital payment token business in the broadly crypto-friendly city-state.

The company, which has come under growing scrutiny globally, did not give a reason for its decision beyond ""strategic, commercial and developmental"" considerations and said it would refocus the local unit's operations on becoming a blockchain innovation hub.

Governments and financial watchdogs around the world have intensified scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry this year, posing a challenge to exchanges that have thrived in a mostly unregulated environment.

Singapore is a popular location for cryptocurrency firms due to a comparatively clear regulatory and operating environment and is among the forerunners globally in developing a formal licensing framework.

Binance's Singapore unit was one of well over 100 cryptocurrency companies to apply for a license to operate in Singapore and had been allowed do business while its license request was being processed.

Singapore issued its first licences this year, including to a unit of southeast Asia's largest bank DBS (DBSM.SI), however dozens of others have been withdrawn or rejected.

Binance said its Singapore platform for trading fiat and cryptocurrencies will close by mid-February. In September, the company said that because of local regulation, users in Singapore would not be able to trade on its global platform.

A spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Binance Asia Services had provided them with a plan for orderly cessation of its regulated payment services which ""will allow sufficient time for customers to seek alternative providers, or, if they wish, to liquidate their holdings.""

""I think this (Binance's withdrawal of its application) signifies again Singapore's licence regime is quite stringent,"" said Chia Hock Lai, co-chairman, Blockchain Association Singapore.

""Having said that, Binance also stated that Singapore will remain as their blockchain innovation hub, so it is still consistent with the narrative that Singapore is a very important blockchain hub.""

Financial regulators in Hong Kong, Britain, Germany, and Japan among others have targeted Binance, raising issues such as consumer protection and anti-money laundering checks. Some have banned the platform from certain activities, while others have warned consumers that it was unlicensed to operate. read more

181,singapore,Malaysia detects first Omicron case; VTL with Singapore continues,"KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - Malaysia has detected its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant but its health minister said the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme between the country and Singapore will continue.

The variant was identified in a 19-year-old woman who had arrived from South Africa via Singapore on Nov 19, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said in a briefing on Friday (Dec 3).

She is a student at a private university in Ipoh, Perak, and has completed her Covid-19 vaccination, he said.

The student was quarantined for 10 days before being released on Nov 29.

Authorities had re-tested earlier positive samples after the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced Omicron as a variant of concern on Nov 24, Mr Khairy said.

Five other people who shared a vehicle with the woman prior to her quarantine all tested negative.

""It's important to note that this case came in to Malaysia on Nov 19 before South Africa reported the first case to the World Health Organisation,"" he said.

""After we found out about Omicron we went back to do genomic tests on all positive cases from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport between Nov 11 and 28. That's how we detected the case.""

Authorities, however, have asked the student along with eight close contacts to undergo further testing after her earlier test samples were confirmed to be the new variant, Mr Khairy added.

An increasing number of countries are reporting cases of the Omicron variant, which the WHO has said carries a very high risk of causing surges of infection.

Neighbouring Singapore confirmed two imported cases on Thursday.

In response to media queries, Singapore's Ministry of Health saidon Friday that the traveller had arrived in Changi Airport from Johannesburg via Singapore Airlines Flight SQ479 on Nov 19. She remained in the transit holding area until she left for Malaysia on the same day.

The ministry added that 15 passengers on board her flight had been identified as her close contacts, but none entered Singapore with contact tracing underway.

This week, Malaysia temporarily banned the entry of travellers from eight southern African countries that have reported the presence of the variant or are considered high-risk.","KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - Malaysia has detected its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant but its health minister said the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme between the country and Singapore will continue.
