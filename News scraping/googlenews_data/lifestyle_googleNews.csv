The study, published in The Obesity Society’s (TOS) journal Obesity, utilised multi-trajectory modelling to analyse the longitudinal relationship linking concurrent changes in lifestyle patterns and the BMI z scores of young children, revealing their influence on childhood obesity.
The multi-trajectory modelling implemented by the researchers highlighted groups of children with comparable lifestyle patterns and BMI z score trajectories, with multinomial logistic regression assessing the determinants of the trajectory groups.
Behavioural indicators of childhood obesityThe researchers distinguished three trajectory groups of childhood lifestyle patterns and BMI z scores, all demonstrating various healthy and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours.
Group one being an “unhealthy lifestyle, with low BMI z”, group two “healthy lifestyle pattern, mid-BMI z“, and group three “unhealthiest lifestyle pattern, high BMI z“.","parental, impact, z, lifestyle, bmi, patterns, pattern, group, obesity, children, childhood, study"

While healthy lifestyles play an important role in reducing disease burden, the researchers warn that healthy lifestyle promotion alone ""might not substantially reduce the socioeconomic inequity in health, and other measures tackling social determinants of health are warranted.""
Lifestyle factors are commonly viewed as mediators between socioeconomic status and health, but it's not clear to what extent healthy lifestyles might alleviate the socioeconomic inequities in health.
Their findings are based on 44,462 US adults aged 20 years or older and 399,537 UK adults aged 37-73 years.
Unhealthy lifestyles mediated a small proportion of the socioeconomic inequity in health in both US and UK adults; therefore, healthy lifestyle promotion, although essential, alone might not substantially reduce the socioeconomic inequity in health, and other measures tackling social determinants of health are warranted, say the researchers.","socioeconomic, inequity, lifestyle, status, lifestyles, explains, adults, cvd, risks, small, unhealthy, health, healthy, uk"

Healthy living was defined by five things: not smoking, meeting guidelines for physical activity, following a healthy diet, moderate alcohol use, and moderate sleep duration.
