Life expectancy at birth dropped to 77.8 years from 78.8 in 2019, according to provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Black men saw a three-year decline in life expectancy, while the gap between the sexes rose to 5.4 years, the most in more than two decades.
The figures capture the impact of a pandemic that’s been directly responsible for almost half a million American deaths.
Life expectancy in America had already shown signs of stalling out in the years before the coronavirus, after rising steadily for most of the period since World War II.","plunged, war, deaths, world, signs, life, ii, expectancy, 2020, higher, pandemic, half"

“At the same time,” he said on Thursday, “Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV (drone) strikes and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries.
Sullivan said the Biden administration already had halted two sales of precision-guided munitions and kept regional allies in the region informed of actions to avoid surprises.
The State Department is also reviewing a Trump administration designation last month of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.
The Biden administration last week approved all transactions involving Yemen’s Houthi movement for the next month as it carries out the review.","trump, president, war, end, yemen, biden, ends, saudi, administration, arabia, support"

“We are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales,” Biden said.
The rebels launched missiles at an airport and airbase in Saudi Arabia in 2019, and at Saudi oil stations last year.
Sheline worries Saudi Arabia could try to entice the US back into military support with claims that its actions are defensive in nature.

Captain Sir Tom Moore's coffin is carried by members of the Armed Forces during his funeral service at Bedford Crematorium on Saturday.
Draped in a union flag, his coffin was carried by soldiers while a World War II-era C-47 Dakota plane performed an honorary fly-past.

The Federal Government plans to spend A$498 million (S$520 million) on an extension of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra that will expand its exhibition space and allow it to display larger objects such as a fighter helicopter and a reconnaissance plane.
However, some MPs in the committee are expected to write a dissenting report, as the project has proven controversial and raised questions about the proper aims of a national war memorial.
Critics of the war memorial's overhaul have expressed concern about the enormous cost, arguing that the memorial already successfully and respectfully chronicles Australia's war history for the general public.
He said the museum should be a ""poignant tribute"" to Australians who died at war, rather than a military museum.","overhaul, war, memorial, stirs, military, project, australia, costly, controversy, museum, australian, revamp, sydney, national"

Should a politically driven world war and a biologically driven pandemic, more than seven decades apart, be put side by side at all?
In fact, before World War II, combatants were far more likely to die of an infectious disease than from battle-related trauma.
World War II was the deadliest war in human history, but not in American history: that distinction belongs to the Civil War.
In retrospect, the American response to World War II stands in sharp contrast to the current political divisions over the coronavirus, and the fragmented and uneven national response.","toll, war, fair, deaths, death, world, history, ii, killed, battles, died, pandemic, compare, coronavirus"

Neuruppin prosecutor Cryll Klement told the Associated Press that the man, whose name is being withheld under Germany’s privacy laws, is alleged to have worked at the Sachsenhausen camp between 1942 and 1945 as an enlisted member of the Nazi Party’s paramilitary wing.
The prosecutor said the Neuruppin office was given the case in 2019 by the special federal prosecutors’ office in Ludwigsburg charged with investigating Nazi-era war crimes.
The charges come less than two weeks after prosecutors in the northern town of Itzehoe filed similar charges against a 95-year-old woman who worked during the war as the secretary to the SS commandant of the Stutthof concentration camp.
The camp was notorious for early experiments in the killing of inmates by gas in what became a trial run for the murder of millions in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.","naziera, war, 100yearold, concentration, charged, trial, camp, prosecutors, told, worked, prosecutor, man, alleged, sachsenhausen, nazi, crimes"
