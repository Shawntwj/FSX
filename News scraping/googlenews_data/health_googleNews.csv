After four years of attempts to strip health care from millions of Americans, President Biden will sign two executive actions that will begin to restore and strengthen Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care.
These actions demonstrate a strong commitment by the Biden-Harris Administration to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, meet the health care needs created by the pandemic, reduce health care costs, protect access to reproductive health care, and make our health care system easier to navigate and more equitable.
As part of their reviews, agencies will consider whether to take additional actions to strengthen and protect access to health care.
President Biden is also issuing a Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care.","sign, care, fact, medicaid, insurance, strengthening, president, quality, americans, reproductive, sheet, executive, access, health, protect, affordable, orders"

And no one is saying yet how soon the results of these sorts of studies of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines will be available.
There are other candidate COVID-19 vaccines in the pipeline, and tests will need to be done on them as well.

MethodsIn this retrospective observational cohort study, we repurposed private insurance claims data provided by Aetna (Connecticut, USA), to measure health-care delays in tuberculosis diagnosis in the USA in 2008–16.
Health-care delays were defined as the duration between the first health-care visit for a tuberculosis symptom and the initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment.
FindingsWe confirmed 738 active tuberculosis cases (incidence 1·45 per 100 000 person-years) with a median health-care delay of 24 days (IQR 10–45).

“What we’re going to see, and we’ll probably see it soon, is that people will realize that we take safety very seriously,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the president’s top medical adviser for the coronavirus, during an interview on the ABC News program, “This Week.”“We’re out there trying to combat the degree of vaccine hesitancy that still is out there,” Dr. Fauci said.
“And one of the real reasons why people have hesitancy is concern about the safety of the vaccine.”On Friday, federal officials lifted a pause that had been recommended on April 13 for the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because of a few cases of a rare blood clotting disorder that had occurred mainly among younger women.

Potential benefits of human genome editing include faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders.
However, some risks exist, for example, with germline and heritable human genome editing, which alter the genome of human embryos and could be passed on to subsequent generations, modifying descendants’ traits.
The reports published today deliver recommendations on the governance and oversight of human genome editing in nine discrete areas, including human genome editing registries; international research and medical travel; illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research; intellectual property; and education, engagement and empowerment.
The recommendations focus on systems-level improvements needed to build capacity in all countries to ensure that human genome editing is used safely, effectively, and ethically.","public, issues, somatic, research, advancement, editing, global, human, health, genome, recommendations, reports, including"

From Utah grocery chain Harmons to Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan Chase, companies are telling their unvaccinated workers to get the shots or pay more for health insurance.
In a September survey, the Society for Human Resource Management found less than 1% of organizations had raised health insurance premiums for unvaccinated workers and 13% have considered doing so.
Since mid-October, unvaccinated employees have had $60 deducted from their wages each month to go into this pool.

Their statement was issued after a group of South African health organisations published a paper on medrxiv.org as a pre-print, meaning the work was not yet certified by peer review.
Earlier in the day, microbiologist Anne von Gottberg at NICD had echoed the same views at an online news conference hosted by the World Health Organization, saying South Africa was seeing an increase in COVID-19 reinfections due to Omicron.
