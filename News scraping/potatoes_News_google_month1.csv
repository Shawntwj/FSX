Self-confessed “potato man” jimlad83 shared his secret tip with his TikTok followers.

In the video he explains that you should pour a generous glug of vegetable oil into a roasting tin before popping it into the oven for 15 minutes.

In the meantimes parboil your peeled and quartered potatoes in salted water, before draining them and adding a hefty sprinkling of plain flour to the pan.

Adding the lid to the pan, give the spuds a vigorous shake until they are coated in the plain flour.

Remove the roasting tin from the oven and then place the potatoes in the oil - be VERY careful doing this as the oil will be extremely hot.

Jim suggests letting them sizzle for a moment then season with salt, pepper dried rosemary and thyme.

He then adds his secret ingredient Clover spreadable margerine, placing several heaped scoops into the pan.

Cook the potatoes at 180 for 40 minutes at which point turn them over and bake for another 30 minutes or until crispy.

Jim’s followers agreed that the spuds “looked amazing” with many declaring they would be using Jim’s method from now on.

1,potatoes,Sweet Potato Is The Caribbean’s Regenerative Giant,"Originally domesticated in Latin America more than 5,000 years ago, sweet potatoes currently grow in more developing countries than any other root crop, with up to a million tonnes produced in the Caribbean per year (FAOSTAT, 2016). Identified as the fifth most important food crop in the developing world, and one of the main crops identified for Caribbean food security, sweet potatoes produce more biomass and nutrients per hectare than any other food crop. This superfood has immense potential to fuel Caribbean development, not only in the alleviation of food insecurity and as a nutrition crop but also from the perspective of climate adaptation and mitigation, and as a driver of economic development.

Sweet potatoes are able to grow in a variety of settings and conditions. Small and subsistence farmers have the ability to produce the crop on small parcels of marginal or inferior land without pricey inputs such as labour, fertilizers and irrigation— allowing rural communities to take charge of their own production and food security. As sweet potatoes have gained importance as a strategic crop, many production systems have transitioned to larger, commercial-sized acreages.

The largest producers in the region are currently Jamaica (43,188 tonnes in 2019), Haiti (42,002 tonnes in 2019), St Vincent and the Grenadines (2,500 tonnes in 2019), Dominica (2,385 tonnes in 2019) and Barbados (2,093 tonnes in 2019). (FAOSTAT)

Sweet potato is conducive to sustainable growth, producing high yields per unit area of land with limited impact to air, water, land, soil or forests and can grow at both high and low altitudes, with a smaller environmental footprint than other staple crops. It easily adapts to harsh environmental conditions— also making it a climate-resilient crop— and provides environmental benefits with respect to climate change mitigation and soil health.

As a perennial, or crop that lives for 3 or more years, the sweet potato crop does not need frequent replanting or reseeding which means that it is not damaging to the soil and can grow in extremely dry conditions.

In 2020, Dr Angela Alleyne, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry at the University of the West Indies (UWI), conducted research on 15 varieties of sweet potato across five Caribbean countries, and identified several drought-tolerant varieties under commercial production in Dominica (“SDPW-01” and “SRDY-DOM”), Grenada (“Cricket Gill” and “Hucky”), Jamaica (“Ganja” and “Fire on Land”), and St. Lucia (“SSLYY”). These climate resilient varieties are an excellent choice for production as the region continues to experience more severe dry seasons.

Recently, the “Up-lifter” variety of sweet potato, in Jamaica, was also identified for its role in soil protection. Farmers have reported that within 10 weeks of planting, the crop covers the soil, preventing erosion.

Sweet potatoes present an excellent opportunity for food waste reduction— most parts of the plant are edible, including leaves, roots, and vines. Regional processors have reported that between 30 and 50 per cent of production typically gets thrown away in processing, but with some creativity, this is avoidable.

An effective role for the underutilized parts of the sweet potato plant, for example, is in animal feed. Not only is sweet potato a nutritious option for animals, but studies have suggested that animals fed on high protein sweet potato vines produce less methane gas, helping to reduce the 220 pounds of harmful emissions that a single cow produces each year.

From a nutritional perspective, sweet potato is a super food. Sweet potatoes are rich in carbohydrates, micronutrients, antioxidants and fibre and produce more edible energy per hectare per day than wheat, rice or cassava. The leaves and shoots are good sources of vitamins A, C, and B (Riboflavin) and the flesh is one of the best food sources of beta carotene, a powerful antioxidant that the body can convert to vitamin A. Just 125 grams of sweet potato can meet the daily Vitamin A requirement of a preschool child, thus protecting that child from stunting and night blindness.

Globally rising food prices and reduced availability of staples such as cereals and grains has led the governments of the region to establish food and nutrition security goals to reduce reliance on imports, through import substitution with traditional staples, such as sweet potato.

Sweet potato’s role as a strategic food crop was highlighted in Grenada, during COVID-19, when the population was at its most vulnerable.

“What we have seen here at CARDI is a massive increase by farmers and home gardeners in sweet potato production, and this took place as a result of COVID-19,” explained Reginald Andall, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) representative to Grenada. “People have taken it into their own hands to try to increase their local food production, and this is the first year in many years that we have seen such a great demand for sweet potato planting material.”

According to Dr Greg Robin, Jamaica country representative of CARDI, there is an under-tapped income opportunity for regional producers, in that the Caribbean imported approximately $57.4 million worth of sweet potatoes in 2019. Trinidad and Tobago imported 393 tonnes of sweet potatoes during that year alone.

And at a consumer level, not only is sweet potato nutritious and delicious, but it is also affordable. In June 2014, a research team obtained the average prices and nutritional benefits of one hundred and fifty eight commonly consumed foods across six parishes in Jamaica, after which they were ranked. Sweet potato was found to be the cheapest food to make it into the top ten.

In the region, the root vegetable has been typically used in its primary state, either baked, boiled or fried, as an accompaniment to a protein, or as a key ingredient in traditional dishes such as sweet potato pie or Ducana, a dumpling or pudding made from sweet potato, grated coconut, sugar, flour, coconut milk, and/or water, raisins, ginger, grated nutmeg, salt and vanilla extract.

“Sweet potato is the candy vegetable,” says Barbadian Chef, Jason Howard. “It’s one of my favourite vegetables to cook with as it has the perfect texture and taste and is very versatile when transformed into a powder or liquid form.”

Due to a growing health consciousness among Caribbean consumers there has been an emerging market for value added products made with sweet potato.

In recent years, agri-processers have begun to convert the crop into starch, flour, alcohol, confectionery, snacks, purees and thickening agents, nutraceuticals, animal feed, and other value added products.

In September 2020, it was announced that CARDI would be collaborating with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to set up a solar-energy drying project to produce flour from sweet potato in Grenada. That project is ongoing.

In September 2020, Onel Williams, owner of food services company Essential Goods and Services Trading Ltd, producers of the Nella's Foods JA brand, launched Nella's Tendaronis, Jamaica’s first sweet potato pasta.

In Barbados, agri-food processor Carmeta’s transforms the succulent Bajan sweet potato into a variety of value added options including Carmeta’s Sweet Potato Flour, Carmeta’s Marion Sweet Potato Cookies and Carmeta’s Sweet Potato ‘n Spice Sorbet.

Starch and flour processing from sweet potato has provided the opportunity to create new economic and employment activities for rural households, while adding nutritional value to local food systems. Repositioning sweet potato production and its potential for value-added products will optimize its food systems benefits to the region.

Sweet potato is the Caribbean’s regenerative giant. It is adaptable to a wide range of uses, from food security crop to cash crop, from human nutrition to animal feed, from fresh food to processed products and as a strategic regenerative crop for the community, the economy and the environment.","Not only is sweet potato a nutritious option for animals, but studies have suggested that animals fed on high protein sweet potato vines produce less methane gas, helping to reduce the 220 pounds of harmful emissions that a single cow produces each year.

Jim Chapman, who calls himself the ""potato man"", has shared hundreds of videos on TikTok, where he's known as @jimlad83, on how he prepares his roast dinners.

And the way he cooks his roast potatoes has won him one of his biggest following yet, over 120,000 followers, reports Daily Star.

(Image: TikTok / @jimlad83)

But Jim said it all starts from picking the right type of potatoes.

He said the right variety of potato ""without a doubt is Maris Piper"".

And to guarantee that crispy skin, you also have to use the right fats and seasoning.

Jim said: ""When Parboiling your potatoes do it with salty water then give them a sprinkle of plain flour afterward.

""There are so many ways to season a potato but I find the most popular and consistently nice way is to add salt, pepper, Rosemary, Thyme and a couple of lumps of Clover.""

Jim swears by margarine, preferably Clover, as it adds ""a buttery flavour and also helps with a golden crunchiness"".

And for oil, Jim uses Crisp n Dry rapeseed oil but will also use fancy goose fat for Christmas and Easter roasts.

Jim said: ""It was in fact my awesome TikTok followers that suggested the goose fat which does an excellent job but as it is more expensive I like to save it for special occasions.""

The dad and husband said he joined the video-sharing app in March 2020 when his daughter signed him up.

""I started doing different videos and was hooked once I realised I was able to cheer people up during lockdown,"" he recalled.

He added: ""Now I find myself trying to perfect the whole roast every Sunday whilst documenting it on TikTok, receiving comments and tips trying my best to interact to them all.

""When I get asked, which I do a lot, on how do I cook a roast dinner the best bit of advice I could give would be to make sure you have plenty of time, don’t rush, try and enjoy it, sometimes a glass of wine can help!

""I am the captain of our local pub skittles team in which I have the responsibility of doing the food for the teams after the game.

10,potatoes,Dealing with double whammy of drought and contract cut — Farm Focus,"by George Fullerton

New Brunswick potato farmers Brent and Carol Anderson continued the Anderson tradition of getting their crops harvested and safely stored again this fall. Brent is the third generation of Andersons, based in Beechwood, N.B., to carry on the farming tradition.

The farm is on the Cahill Road in central Carleton County and a couple of miles east of the Saint John River.

Brent’s grandparents John and Edith Anderson operated a small 50-acre mixed farm at the location. When John became very ill with arthritis, their sons Dean, Frank, and Gordon were taken out of school to attend to spring planting and general farm operations.

Like many of their generation, there wasn’t much schooling after that. Dean and Frank dedicated themselves to farming, while Gordon sought out other employment.

In 1956, Dean and Frank began contracting potatoes to McCain Foods, delivering to the French fry plant in Florenceville. The two Anderson brothers, with the dedicated support of Dean’s wife Clara, continued to add land and built up the operation, eventually abandoning less profitable aspects of the mixed farm and concentrating more and more on potatoes and other cash crops. In addition to contracting potatoes to McCain, they grew seed potatoes and marketed table potatoes. They also produced peas contracted to McCain, and grew grains in rotation with potatoes.

Through their tenure, the Anderson brothers grew the operation to around 175 acres of potato production annually. The brothers were recognized a number of times by McCain Foods as one of the company’s top-10 producers.

NEW GENERATION

In 1986, Dean and Frank were looking forward to retirement and began the management transition to Dean and Clara’s son Brent and his wife Carol.

Brent and Carol continued with a high standard of management and growth of Anderson Farms Ltd. During the past 30-odd years, the farm has been recognized by McCain Foods 16 times as one of its top-10 producers and twice received the champion grower award.

The current generation of managers has built the farm’s potato production up to around 500 acres annually.

Family values continue to be important in the operation. Brent and Carol employ their son Ryan on a full-time basis and their daughter Cara on a seasonal basis, along with Brent’s brother Stacey, cousins Terry Anderson and Calvin Ruff, cousin-in-law Laurie Crain, as well as Jordan Wade, Trudy Vail, and Ryan Crain.

“We have a very dedicated group of employees and they continue to make a major contribution to our success,” said Brent. “I attribute our good quality record to our attention to a good crop rotation plan. We follow every potato crop with a plow-down year, where we plant a mix of clover and alfalfa. The crop is chopped with a batwing mower and plowed down to add organic matter to the soil and boost biological activity. The alfalfa has a deep and aggressive tap root, which penetrates and breaks up soil compaction and benefits water control in the soils.”

Following plow-down, fields are planted in oats, which are contracted to Quaker Oats for human consumption. Harvested oats are delivered to Eastern Grains in Drummond, N.B., where the crop is cleaned, dried, and stored, and eventually shipped out to Quaker production facilities.

In recent years, more than 90 percent of the Andersons’ potato production has been contracted to McCain Foods, with the balance to table markets. Varieties produced include Russet Burbank, Shepody, and Innovator.

Potato seed is sourced from the New Brunswick government’s Bon Accord Elite Seed Potato Centre as E1 stock, which the Andersons plant as E2 stock the following spring. The harvest is sold as E3 product to McCain Foods.

FALL FERTILIZING

In the autumn, prior to the potato growing year, fields are uniformly grid sampled using two-acre blocks. Fields are then limed and fertilized with a GPS-equipped spreader truck operated by County Lime Ltd. according to the nutrient requirements of specific areas of the fields.

“Springtime is very busy and having fertility for the potato crop already in the ground avoids one of the springtime chores,” said Brent.

As McCain contractors, the Andersons must subscribe to the CanadaGAP (Good Agricultural Practices) Program, which is a food safety audit program. They have a comprehensive audit scheduled every four years and may be subject to a random audit in the intervening years.

The program requires detailed record keeping.

The audits focus a good deal of attention on traceability from seed through the production cycles and delivery to the processing plants. The audits review records of inputs, field rotations, chemical storage, application, and container disposal, and many more production practices.

This year, the Andersons wrapped up their potato harvest during the first week of October. According to Brent, the combination of COVID-19 and this summer’s drought made for a very challenging season.

Because pandemic restrictions shut down a good deal of restaurant businesses, at least temporarily, there was a severe decline in demand for French fries. As a result, McCain Foods announced a 15 percent cut to producers’ traditional contracts for 2020.

Brent said the contract cut had a major impact on their operation but added that this year’s drought hurt them even more.

“The drought was definitely the worst I have seen in my lifetime,” he said. “It has caused us a production reduction of 30 to 40 percent. This will be a very hard year for all producers.”

Despite the production deficit, Brent said that the quality of their potatoes was very good.

The Andersons celebrated the end of harvest with a big turkey dinner for their entire crew – another important tradition!","In 1956, Dean and Frank began contracting potatoes to McCain Foods, delivering to the French fry plant in Florenceville.
The brothers were recognized a number of times by McCain Foods as one of the company’s top-10 producers.
The current generation of managers has built the farm’s potato production up to around 500 acres annually.
In recent years, more than 90 percent of the Andersons’ potato production has been contracted to McCain Foods, with the balance to table markets.
As a result, McCain Foods announced a 15 percent cut to producers’ traditional contracts for 2020.",https://www.atlanticfarmfocus.ca/farm-focus-november-2020/2021/1/29/dealing-with-double-whammy-of-drought-and-contract-cut,2021-01-30 08:00:00+00:00
11,potatoes,How to Make Sweet Potato Skins Taste Delicious,"I have been getting a lot of emails lately. Most are about baking soda and ground beef, one was about Stuart Murdoch, and a fair number are about sweet potatoes, their skins, and how I am a doofus for not eating them (a thing I mentioned in this blog about roasting them):

Unlike white potatoes such as russets or Yukons, yams and sweet potatoes do not have skins that are pleasurable to eat. Instead of getting crispy, they get tough, with a texture somewhere in-between paper and leather.

While no one disagreed with my description of the skin’s texture, they urged me to “consider the syrupy, caramelized sweetness and rich flavors that can become attached to the skins’ inner surfaces,” and to “butter that bad boy liberally (or use oil or shortening) and sprinkle on some coarse salt.” (Oddly these emails were some of the most polite I’ve ever received, unlike the beef emails, which were quite rude).

As a dedicated consumer of white potato peels, I was somewhat embarrassed to learn I have been missing out. So I did what the nice, polite readers suggested and baked another sweet potato.

I kept the cooking temp and time the same (400℉ for an hour in the oven/half that in the air fryer), and left the skin un-punctured, only this time I coated the yam in bacon grease and Sicilian sea salt before baking. If you’ve never coated a root vegetable in bacon grease, it’s very easy: scoop some grease up with your (clean) fingers, and rub it all around the potato with your hands, then sprinkle on salt to form a glittering crust.

I must say, I was not disappointed with the results. Though I stand by my initial assessment that sweet potato skins are “leathery,” they weren’t unchewable, and chewing on something infused with bacon fat is pretty fun. (Vegetarians: Try olive or avocado oil.) By itself the peel is pretty bitter, but that bitterness pairs well with the potato’s sweet interior. In fact, the combination of sweet flesh, lightly bitter peel, and all those caramelized bits on the inside is pretty delightful.

But more importantly—nay, most importantly—this means I never have to peel another sweet potato. And as a fan of not over- doing things, this is great news.","Most are about baking soda and ground beef, one was about Stuart Murdoch, and a fair number are about sweet potatoes, their skins, and how I am a doofus for not eating them (a thing I mentioned in this blog about roasting them):Unlike white potatoes such as russets or Yukons, yams and sweet potatoes do not have skins that are pleasurable to eat.

12,potatoes,These Martha Stewart-approved cinnamon rolls are made with … mashed potatoes?,"The secret to light and fluffy cinnamon rolls, according to Martha Stewart, is a lot of love and a little bit of … mashed potato. One medium russet potato, to be exact.

In a post from December, the Martha Stewart Instagram account shared a photo of a cinnamon roll recipe from food editor, Lauryn Tyrell, saying, ""Meet your latest baking project: our lightest, fluffiest cinnamon rolls ever. The addition of mashed potatoes is our secret to its ultra-light texture.""

In the recipe, published by Martha Stewart Living in 2018, an eight-ounce potato is peeled and cut into one-inch pieces. After boiling and mashing, the potato is added to a mixture of butter, milk, yeast, sugar egg, flour and salt to create the dough.

Then comes the rising.

When I attempted this intriguing recipe at home, I joked that you'd need to really sit down and plan the rising times into your schedule: There's an initial rise, followed by rolling the dough, adding a cinnamon and brown sugar filling and slicing the whole thing into beautiful cinnamon rolls.

These decadent cinnamon rolls were a labor of love — but well worth it. Terri Peters

Then, you guessed it, more rising: The rolls hang out for eight hours (overnight, in my case) in the refrigerator.

The next morning, I removed my rolls from the fridge and let them rise on the counter for another hour and a half. Finally, it was time to pop the potato-filled treats into a 350 F oven.

While the cinnamon rolls baked for about 30 minutes, I mixed up the cream cheese glaze included in the recipe. I'm gonna be honest: It was very hard to resist licking it right off the spatula while I waited for the rolls to finish baking.

After cooling and glazing the fresh, golden-brown rolls, the recipe recommended letting them sit for another 20 minutes: ""This completes the cooking process and yields tender and airy, not gummy, buns,"" it reads.

While I couldn't really taste potato in the cinnamon rolls, the addition definitely changed up the texture. Terri Peters

For those keeping score at home, I was nearly 14 hours into the process at this point. Was it worth it? Absolutely.

The cinnamon rolls had a unique, subtly starchy flavor that I can only assume was the mashed potato's doing. The texture was light, almost crispy and flaky — again, thanks to the potato — with the butter and cinnamon-sugar filling caramelizing beautifully around the edges.

While they required a good amount of work in the kitchen, these rolls turned out to be a rewarding project. After all, any time I can work potatoes into my breakfast, that's a morning win for me.","The secret to light and fluffy cinnamon rolls, according to Martha Stewart, is a lot of love and a little bit of … mashed potato.

13,potatoes,Cover crop research on Island farm yields positive results — Farm Focus,"by Emily Leeson

“We have to do anything we can to minimize the time soil is left bare without anything growing,” says Dr. Judith Nyiraneza, a research scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) based in Charlottetown.

Nyiraneza and Oyster Cove Farms of Hamilton, P.E.I., recently completed a two-year study that tested the performance of cover crops planted following the potato harvest.

Nyiraneza said that a variety of cover crop options can help producers better manage soil health and reduce the environmental impacts of soil erosion.

When soil erodes, the valuable topsoil is lost. As it is blown away by winds or washed away by rainfall, the quality of the soil decreases – ultimately resulting in lower yields and potentially higher costs for producers trying to remedy their soil’s decreasing productivity. Erosion also increases the potential for groundwater pollution as agricultural chemicals from the soil are swept into water sources.

Nyiraneza said several factors account for the high risk of erosion on P.E.I. While the humid climate and sandy soil set the stage, traditional farming practices also play a role. With more than 80,000 acres of potatoes grown on the Island each year, the aggressive production takes its toll on the land. Growers gearing up for a short window of spring planting tend to till in the fall, leaving the land exposed to the snowmelt of early spring. Even after the potato planting, fields are relatively bare for several more weeks until the crop fully develops. Oscillating periods of drought and intense rainfall worsen the erosion problem.

The two-year study tested the performance of Winter rye, Winter wheat, and Spring barley planted after the potato harvest.

Cover crops work in many capacities. They increase organic matter and available nitrogen in the soil, promote beneficial insects, deter weed growth, bring up deep-rooted minerals, and increase the soil’s moisture-holding capacity. Cover crop plant growth also protects against erosion from wind and water – holding the soil in place and protecting it against the impact of heavy rainfall and run-off.

“Soil particles are detached by rain impact, and if there is a slope they are transported to other places,” said Nyiraneza.

During the study, the researchers used splash pans in cover crop fields to measure the soil movement caused by raindrops and the soil’s vulnerability to erosion. They measured the amount of carbon and nitrogen in the soil and measured the nitrates in the soil at different times throughout the fall, spring, and summer.

“We also did analysis on the yield quality of Winter wheat and Winter rye the following summer,” said Nyiraneza.","Nyiraneza said that a variety of cover crop options can help producers better manage soil health and reduce the environmental impacts of soil erosion.

14,potatoes,Sun Valley Resort suspends all ski operations Friday due to snow conditions: 'It was almost like mashed potatoes out there',"Operations may be delayed through Saturday morning, according to resort officials.

SUN VALLEY, Idaho — Sun Valley resort announced on Facebook that all skiing and riding operations on Bald Mountain have been suspended as of 2 p.m. on Friday. Operations were suspended due to snow conditions.

Sun Valley reported a whopping 31 inches of snow accumulation in the 24 hours between 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday and 5:30 a.m. on Thursday. As of 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, the resort's snow stake camera showed nearly 19 inches of new snow since it was cleared at 4 p.m. Wednesday.

Ethan Davis, an avalanche forecaster with Sawtooth Avalanche Center, advises all skiers to stay out of the backcountry and the decision for the resort to close early made sense.

""We saw widespread national avalanche activity, we heard of three skiers triggering avalanches in out of bounds terrain near the Warm Springs drainage and Bald mountain so the decision to close certainly isn't surprising,"" Davis said.

Due to avalanche mitigation work, all of the bowls, Seattle Ridge, and Sunrise Expansion Area were closed on Thursday and remain closed on Friday. No uphill traffic is allowed until further notice.

""My kids wanted to go over to Warm Springs so we kinda got in the car and drove over there got unpacked and started walking over there and that's pretty much when the entire mountain closed,"" said skier Matt Hanna.

Matt Hanna and his family drove to Sun Valley from Layton, Utah. It was their first time at the resort, and unfortunately, it was cut short because of winter conditions.

""It was a little bit overboard, we all like a powder but they got a ton overnight on top of even more,"" he said. ""It was almost like mashed potatoes out there, it was pretty nasty"".

Hanna said visibility was low, making it dangerous for newcomers on the mountain.

""The signage is challenging when you can only see five, ten feet and front of you and there are tons of people,"" he said. ""I haven't seen this before in terms of people today kinda cry uncle that usually wouldn't and say 'I'm done for the day.'""

Davis said this winter season has been abnormal. The season started with a big snowfall early on and was followed by a long period of drought. Davis added that when there's a long drought, the new snowfall doesn't adhere to the underlying snowfall, ultimately causing dangerous conditions.

""That's really what kinds driving a lot of these warnings,"" Davis said. ""You don't need to be in some extreme environment to see an avalanche, they can occur around town, just on the hillsides around town especially in the Wood River Valley and they happen frequently.""

Snow will continue to fall in most mountain areas through Friday night, bringing upwards of eight more inches of snow at higher elevations. The snow will taper off on Friday before starting up again early next week. See the latest KTVB weather forecast.

Avalanche warnings are in effect for the West Central Mountains near McCall and a wide swath of Central Idaho's backcountry that includes areas surrounding the Wood River Valley until 6 a.m. Sunday.

No uphill traffic will be permitted for the remainder of the day Friday and opening on Saturday morning may be delayed.","SUN VALLEY, Idaho — Sun Valley resort announced on Facebook that all skiing and riding operations on Bald Mountain have been suspended as of 2 p.m. on Friday.

15,potatoes,There’s Nothing Better Than This Cheesy Potato Soup,"One thing you’ll have to decide is whether to remove the jalapeño seeds. This will depend on how spicy you like things, and how fiery your peppers are. Sometimes you can predict the heat of a chile by smelling it — if it’s a scorcher, it will make your nose tingle. But a more reliable way is to cut one open and give its guts a lick. Usually, I end up removing some but not all of the seeds by shaking the opened pepper over the sink. It’s the lazy person’s way, and it works for me.

Along with the pickled peppers, I garnish bowls with some cilantro and scallions for freshness, plus plenty of grated Cheddar, which melts into a gooey raft as it meets the hot soup.

Then pair it with a leafy salad for something green, along with slices of good crusty bread to round it all out. Whether you get those slices from a homemade loaf or otherwise, you’ll be happy for the chance to sop up every last drop of this savory, creamy soup.","One thing you’ll have to decide is whether to remove the jalapeño seeds.

17,potatoes,One Pan Dinner: A steak lover's dream,"Recipe: Coffee-Chili–Rubbed Steaks with Sweet Potatoes and Scallions

Why This Recipe Works: While we usually depend on a ripping-¬hot skillet to turn out steaks with a strong crust, we saw potential in our sheet pan to give us similar results for a complete meal using a more hands-off approach. A pleasantly bitter coffee rub accentuated the meat’s savoriness; chili ¬powder added heat, and brown sugar guaranteed some appealing caramelization. We sliced sweet potatoes into wedges and let them soften in the pan as it heated up, then added the steaks 25 minutes in and scattered scallions over the potatoes. Since the pan had preheated while cooking the sweet potatoes, it provided the sizzle we love (and the sear that comes with it) when we added the steaks. Our steaks reached a juicy medium-¬rare in only 12 minutes. To give our dish a final ¬flourish, we served our steaks with quick-pickled radishes. Don’t be afraid to use all of the coffee rub on the steak—it aids in browning in addition to adding flavor. The scallions should be left whole; trim off only the small roots. We prefer these steaks cooked to medium-¬rare.","A pleasantly bitter coffee rub accentuated the meat’s savoriness; chili ¬powder added heat, and brown sugar guaranteed some appealing caramelization.
