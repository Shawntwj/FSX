TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical said on Friday (Oct 1) that "human error" caused metal contaminants to get into Moderna Covid-19 vaccine doses, leading to a recall.
Moderna conducted an investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi, which operates the plant where the contamination occurred.
A total of five, sequential lots of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine manufactured at Rovi between June 27 and July 3 were investigated.
The first three were shipped to Japan and later recalled after the discovery of particles, later determined to be stainless steel, inside 39 vials.
The companies and Japan's health ministry have said the particles of stainless steel did not pose any additional health risk.
