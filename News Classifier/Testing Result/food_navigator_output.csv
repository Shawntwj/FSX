According to CRUST Group Founder and CEO Travin Singh, in addition to the firm’s conventional business model of producing and selling its own upcycled products, it is also adding a new business model which has been dubbed ‘Sustainable Unique Label’ or SUL, which will see the firm coming in as an R&D partner for other food and beverage firms to work on the development of unique upcycled products.
“The target in particular will be big food firms that have a lot of food waste left over from their production operations which they would usually donate or throw away, as currently most of them are not aware or not able to upcycled this waste,”​ Travin told FoodNavigator-Asia​.
“In addition to SULs, we’re also planning to do a lot more in terms of special projects with high PR value to bring up consumer awareness of upcycled products, e.g.
“CROP also has an additional good point of marketing which is that it is a functional drink, as it contains parabiotics (compounds containing inactivated unused parts of probiotics) that are believed to improve microbiome health,”​ he said.","['model', 'upcycling', 'reveals', 'firms', 'cobranding', 'upcycled', 'big', 'crust', 'singapore', 'worked', 'need', 'beverage', 'help', 'collaboration', 'beer', 'food']",idiosyncratic,10.6773074

plant-based, fermentation technology and cell culture technology,”​ Cooperhouse told FoodNavigator-Asia​.
“We've also found through our research that foodservice operators are very motivated [to try cultured seafood] because they currently have such an inconsistent supply chain - It's the reason why restaurants don't always have seafood on their menu, it's very variable because the supply chain is so unpredictable,”​ he added.

“So until [real replacements] are made, I believe the future of alternative proteins in Asia [for the foreseeable future] will lie in hybrid products, a combination of plant-based ingredients with conventional meat,”​ Wang added.
Chinese plant-based meat firm HEROTEIN for example is partnering with cultured animal product company Mission Barns to develop a line of hybrid meat products.
“In terms of cost, it will take some time for the price of cultured meat to come down, and the food system needs an alternative protein option that is more affordable and available to the masses within a shorter period of time.
So hybrid products look like the best option to solve these challenges and gain consumer acceptance more quickly for the alternative protein market to grow faster.”​HEROTEIN aims to be the first to launch hybrid products within the country, which is a bold objective given that cultured meat has yet to see regulatory frameworks set up as of yet.","['protein', 'steady', 'stepbystep', 'chicken', 'products', 'consumers', 'meat', 'plantbased', 'industry', 'hybrid', 'experts', 'convert', 'real', 'cultured', 'product', 'strategy']",idiosyncratic,11.6259936

This means that companies looking to market plant-based products in this region need to place more emphasis on the main driving criteria of taste and nutrition – areas which can also be the most challenging for this market.
“Plant proteins have strong market potential but taste, texture and nutritional optimisation are challenges [that many firms still] need to overcome,”​ stated the report authors.
“[Here, we believe that] hybrid formulations with both plant and other proteins are appealing to consumers and represent a winning strategy for manufacturers to overcome these challenges.

The food manufacturing sector is expected to achieve an overall growth of 4.5% as measured by MPI by the end of the year.
In addition to food manufacturing, food exports have also seen significant growth in the first seven months of 2021 and the government has even bigger hopes for this sector, banking on rising food demands and depleted stores in various foreign countries.
“These countries have eased local lockdown measures as vaccination rates increased, so food service businesses have reopened and are recovering, particularly in China to which Thailand saw a 40% growth in exports year-on-year.","['production', 'making', 'measures', 'maintain', 'growth', 'manufacturing', 'hails', 'urges', 'food', 'months', 'covid19', 'yearonyear', 'industry', 'factories', 'vigilance', 'slump', 'exports', 'thailand']",idiosyncratic,16.48485004

“These are massive environmental issues [decimating aquaculture populations], but instead of just staying on the coast and [letting things play out], the only way that the aquaculture can move away and forward is to look to technology.
For instance, using IoT to predict algal blooms and planning harvests and countermeasures.​“But the real prize with technology is for aquaculture to go down the smart farming route, which goes beyond tech to prioritise urbanisation and super-intensive efficiency with a small footprint.

“[One main issue in the industry is that inspections are currently not optimised] as the lead times given are often too short so advanced shipment notice (ASN) information is often not prepared in advance,”​ said MLTI.
“[Firms] should send ASNs in advance and utilise technologies such as QR codes or other labels such that inspections upon arrival can be done by just scanning and reading these – this would lead to a reduction in inspection time,”​ said MLTI.
The reduced number of vehicles also gave advantages such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions and alleviating the problem of driver shortage.”​Distribution waves​The report also highlighted that a phenomenon dubbed ‘distribution waves’ was also adding to logistical issues, calling for food firms to stop tightly adhering to conventions such as compulsory product delivery in the morning.

“The aim is to ensure that agri-food chain legislation for the protection of human health, animal health and welfare, and plant health, is correctly applied and enforced.​“[As for palm oil], imports of palm oil or consumption of food products with palm oil are not banned in the EU.
“​Like in the case of organic produce or other sustainability schemes, consumers in the EU are however demanding sustainable palm oil and guarantees that palm oil does not come from plantations, which cause deforestation,”​ she said.
The jury is still out on the discrimination bit, but though this was not a restriction or ban per se on palm oil in food, to say that there has been ‘no ban’​ on palm oil in the EU does seem to be stretching things a bit.","['nonnegotiable', 'insists', 'consumers', 'products', 'ambassador', 'sustainability', 'west', 'palm', 'produce', 'uk', 'oil', 'sustainable', 'challenges', 'trade', 'eu', 'food', 'strategy']",Man-Made Disaster,11.03855958

This means more rice still needs to be produced in the years to come, especially as market liberalisation in Asia could well lead to reduced production in the future.

That said, on average Lloyds Food Safety Challenge Director Dr Tim Slingsby still found that poorer countries are at higher risk of food safety related diseases and death, and urged all stakeholders in the food industry to pay closer attention to these risks.
That said, some of the countries with the highest satisfaction rates in government management of food safety have also been found in Asia – the top countries for the region were unsurprisingly Singapore (93% satisfied in government’s food safety efforts), Philippines (87%), Indonesia (86%), Malaysia (78%) and China (76%).

Active and smart packaging material are typically made from synthetic dyes, toxic inorganic and organic compounds, and solvents.
In smart packaging, there should be sufficient labelling to not mislead the consumer, and provide recognition of non-edible portions.

Australia’s 2025 National Packaging Targets include shifts to 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging; 70% plastic packaging to be recycled/composted; 50% of recycled content in packaging; and phasing out problematic/unnecessary single-use plastics.
On the other hand, the 2030 Food Waste Strategy aims to cut Australia’s food waste by half by 2030.

WEF researchers proposed that China tackle this escalating problem by also looking at food waste in the value chain from production to consumption, which stands at around 30% globally, and reduce this by implementing a digitalised food supply chain from farm to fork.
“If well implemented, a digitalised food supply chain could reduce food loss by 50%.

“We are pleased with the continuous operation and energy savings achieved with the LKH pumps.”​The broader scope of supply provided greater energy savings from Alfa Laval agitators and pumps, more water savings from Alfa Laval Unique Mixproof valves and agitators, and a smaller footprint due to the compact equipment size and efficiency.

“We need to develop programmes to increase the engagement of landholders and farmers in the adoption of sustainable management practices, and encourage them to become commercial farmers,”​ he stressed.
Ministry ‘encouragement’​The Minister admitted that the low economic return from local agriculture was discouraging more landlords from becoming commercial farmers or upgrading their mechanisms and work systems.
Furthermore, developing marketing schemes and supply chains for small-scale producers will help achieve the sustainability of local vegetable production, he said.","['production', 'imports', 'fresh', 'commercial', 'homegrown', 'food', 'produce', 'uae', 'boosting', 'agriculture', 'local', 'zeyoudi', 'modern', 'seeks', 'slash', 'farmers', 'minister', 'product']",Trade Dispute,21.1993257

“India’s greatest need is for an effective cold chain solution that will integrate the supply chains for agricultural commodities from their respective production centres to consumption centres, thereby reducing physical waste and loss of value of perishable commodities​,” said Pawanexh Kohli, advisor to the National Centre for Cold Chain Development.
Being largely unorganised, the supply chain suffers from a lack of transport facilities, meaning greater reliance on middlemen, he added.
In the process of bringing produce to market, losses occur in the quantity and quality of the produce, owing to improper facilities and poor handling practices employed by these intermediaries.
The doubling of farmers’ income is not possible without doubling the sales and doubling market rate of the agricultural produce, and cold chain is a key enabler to make this happen​,” added Kohli.","['improved', 'supply', 'doubling', 'produce', 'market', 'reducing', 'kohli', 'cold', 'raise', 'chain', 'need', 'farmers', 'income']",Economic Crisis,14.36618555

Fonterra’s Dairy Foods Category director of NZMP, Casey Thomas, said Fonterra developed the ingredient through a manufacturing process where they are now able to reduce the golden appearance of the butter.
Thomas said that while Fonterra’s yellow butter already sees success in the market, there was an opportunity to tap into this new area for customers to use in a variety of applications such as spreadable jar cheese, recombined cream cheese, and potentially in ice cream.
Future plans include launching the product in Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and even South America.","['east', 'white', 'manufacturers', 'cheese', 'ingredient', 'food', 'develops', 'zealand', 'middle', 'fonterra', 'butter', 'yellow', 'product', 'dairy']",idiosyncratic,12.87855009

“Just knowing you should eat your veggies has not proven sufficient; consumption even in developed countries falls short of the daily intake recommended by the World Health Organisation​,” she said.
Rekhy said the basis for the study was the fact that appropriate vegetable consumption was crucial to reduce the risk of diseases such as cardiovascular conditions, cancers and obesity.

Previous methods of estimating the economic value of pollination have focused on desktop calculations of the value of crops and the dependency of those crops on pollinators.
Prof. Wratten says the experimental manipulation of pollination rates is a more direct estimation of the economic value of pollination, or ecosystem services (ES).
After changes in seed yield, seeds per pod and proportion of unfertilised pods as a result of changing pollination rates were identified, they then extrapolated the economic impact of varying pollination rates to the main 18 pollination-dependent crops in New Zealand.

It is believed that the stolen meat is often sold on through online forums and community buying/selling groups on social media.
The reselling of stolen meat is much less likely to arouse suspicion compared to electronic goods, such a stereos and televisions, due to the latter’s dramatic markdown in price.
“In our experience, that’s not merely because meat is an expensive item, but because it’s worth a fair amount on the black market.
We’re aware that it’s often stolen in large quantities, then sold online through social media, and we’ve even seen reports where items like bacon have been used as currency by criminals to barter.”​Auror recorded at least 20 cases of over $200-worth of meat stolen last month.","['month', 'stolen', 'auckland', 'meat', 'nearly', '10000', 'item', 'goods', 'social', 'theft', 'online', 'worth', 'retailers', 'sold', 'media']",idiosyncratic,15.57356248

Despite rising for the third consecutive month, the FAO said April’s price index score of 151.8 points remains 10% below one year ago and more than one third lower than the Food Price Index highs seen in 2011.
Uneven growth​The gradual increase in food prices in recent months has been ‘far from even’, according to the FAO, which highlighted that the current rises were driven largely by a “grim 2016 production outlook for palm oil coupled with a growing worldwide demand”​ which saw palm oil prices hit a 17 month high – leading to a 4.1% spike in the vegetable oil price index.
The FAO also noted that international prices for soy, which is the second most important oil crop to influence the vegetable oil price index, rose due to less favourable 2015/16 production prospects in South America.
Sugar prices, which provided a driver for strong growth in March (growing by 17%), were down by 1.7%, while meat prices rose 0.8% on the back of growing U.S. demand for Australian beef, said the FAO.","['price', 'month', 'continued', 'rise', 'fao', 'spike', 'drives', 'rose', 'palm', 'prices', 'noted', 'index', 'oil', 'food']",Man-Made Disaster,13.4034218

1817,1817,12-Apr-16,Retailers mull effect of China’s new online shopping tax,www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2016/04/12/Retailers-mull-effect-of-China-s-new-online-shopping-tax,"According to media reports, retails giants such as Alibaba said they believed that overseas brands and retailers active on their sites would absorb the higher prices before gradually passing these on to consumers.
Some of these companies have expressed concern at the lack of detail in the new regulations, especially regarding tougher requirements to determine which goods can be imported through cross-border e-commerce warehouses in pilot free-trade zones in 12 cities that were given preferential tax and customs treatment.
E-commerce is witnessing something of a boom in China, where an expanding middle-class that is increasingly unsatisfied with the quality of local products has become steadily more willing to pay higher prices for products from countries where food is deemed safer, such as Australia.
China’s finance ministry unveiled a new 11.9% value added tax last month which analysts said will increase the tax burden on low-end products while lowering the tax rate for some premium items such as cosmetics.
The move was taken by authorities in a bid to level the playing field between offline and online sellers, with the latter heretofore enjoying lower tax rates on imported goods.","['effect', 'witnessing', 'products', 'willing', 'goods', 'warehouses', 'shopping', 'online', 'prices', 'imported', 'higher', 'tax', 'retailers', 'zones', 'chinas', 'mull']",idiosyncratic,11.19165853

Following two years of very high prices, farmers have expanded their planted area and consequently production has increased.
Current arrivals in the main markets in India are 60% below average, following lower production from the current season.
The crop is forecast to fall substantially short this year due to an erratic monsoon, scarcity of rain, lower planted area and a disease which has severely reduced production in the Madhya Pradesh province.
The situation has been aggravated by farmers holding on to stocks, with a view to maximising revenues in the months to come as prices remain firm.","['production', 'markets', 'crop', 'main', 'following', 'prices', 'fall', 'increase', 'planted', 'spice', 'farmers', 'lower', 'madhya', 'sharply']",Acute climatological event (droughts),29.14837835

In fact, EU imports of pork accounted for around 74% of all pork products exported to China in 2015, claims the report.
This is believed to be a result of China suffering from a significant drop in its breeding herd, which in turn led to a tightening of supplies and a rise in domestic pig prices.
A weakening euro was compounded by an abundant supply of pork – exacerbated by Russia’s trade ban – and these factors made EU pig meat attractive to Chinese buyers, the report says.
This, in addition to a low level of consumer trust in domestic pig meat, may help the EU continue to grow its pork exports in China.","['pork', 'remain', 'report', 'meat', 'supply', 'pig', 'market', 'propped', 'exports', 'china', 'eu', 'domestic']",Trade Dispute,7.044059532

Consequently, demand from canneries has weakened, driven by an expectation of lower prices.

According to China Customs data, sucralose exports from the country were up 8% year on year during the first-half of 2015, while prices were down 19%.
Indeed, the two cases differ mainly in the fact that sucralose prices have fallen further and exports have increased even faster.
The accompanying statement attributed this sharp drop to “capacity increases in China​” and the “overhang of unsold Chinese sucralose​”, among other things.
“But the EU and US markets are effectively irreplaceable—if either market were to impose an anti-dumping duty, it would be a huge blow to the Chinese sucralose industry​.”","['manufacturers', 'lyle', 'antidumping', 'tate', 'pull', 'prices', 'industry', 'chinese', 'trigger', 'suit', 'exports', 'sucralose', 'china']",idiosyncratic,16.79104922

This characteristic originally benefited the barley plant because it helped in dispersing the seed and the natural spreading of the species.
Professor Finch said that although the discoveries have the potential to create possibilities in barley breeding processes, the findings have a largely agricultural interest.

CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) Dr Yusof Basiron echoed this concern, saying: “Every year RSPO will meet and they will make new regulations and every one then must follow.

This means blenders that sell fuel into the domestic markets look sharply at the spread between palm oil and diesel prices.

But participation of agriculture in carbon markets—including those involving grazing-based livelihood systems—has so far been quite small.
One reason for this is the challenge of measuring how much carbon is being trapped as a result of improved farming practices.
Only with reliable and affordable approaches measuring, reporting and verifying carbon sequestration can provide access to climate funds.

The study found that while whales do consume huge quantities of prey, they also passed a large proportion of the nutrients they consumed back into ocean surface waters, providing food for other prey fish.
Dr Trish Lavery said that whether whales compete with fisheries for marine resources has been hotly debated, especially in light of depleting fishing stocks in Asia.
The study also said that global declines in marine production occurred at the same time as whale stocks were being reduced during the Industrial whaling era, although a direct correlation could not be made.
Lavery said her research suggested that maintaining or increasing whale numbers could form part of a long-term strategy for the replenishment of surface fisheries.","['declining', 'stocks', 'consumed', 'study', 'prey', 'marine', 'finds', 'fisheries', 'surface', 'whale', 'whales', 'waste', 'waters', 'save']",idiosyncratic,16.0237209

“Several programmes have been rolled out by the government to expand rice production in the eastern states and the impact is already evident from the rapid rise in production over the last few years​.”China’s government has also been attempting to expand its rice production to keep up with demand, but the rapidly rising costs of production and pressure on rice from other competing crops are likely to keep imported rice a lot cheaper than producing rice domestically.

However, rice imports tripled in just one year to around 1.8m tonnes in 2011, and will continue to grow this year to the tune of 2.5m tonnes.
Sign of insecurity​Officials said this increased dependency on food imports should be seen as a sign of food insecurity in China.

“We see that shift being really extraordinary and substantial and it isn’t a shift that’s temporary.
There are similarities in terms of consumer structure between Latin America and Asia, with very wealthy and poor segments of the population, so Asia is familiar with how the country operates.

But, despite initial research, little is understood about the specific molecule or complex in the honey that confers this effect.
But another effect of the high price of New Zealand’s manuka honey is the apparent practice of blending high quality bioactive manuka honey with inferior or less active honeys according to one of the New Zealand Government’s research institutes, GNS Science.
Sources within the manuka honey industry believe it is hard to prove but stress that these practices must be occurring as the quantity of the highly bioactive manuka honey, which is being claimed and offered for sale at retail, appears to be far greater than the actual volume of manuka honey produced in New Zealand.
A major advantage from the research presented by the Auckland University group is that it provides a basis to detect the practice of adulteration of high value manuka honey.","['manuka', 'honey', 'way', 'findings', 'high', 'practice', 'fraud', 'food', 'specific', 'demand', 'research', 'university', 'fingerprint', 'combat', 'zealand']",Acute climatological event (heat stress),14.7317519

The recommendations to switch to the traffic light system were made under the Food Labelling Review carried out by a former Australian health minister Dr Neal Blewett in early 2011, but it has been stiffly opposed by large sections of the food industry.
Traffic light labelling uses green, amber and red lights at the front of the pack to show, at a glance, the relative levels of fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium in a food product, and has been argued for by Australian health groups.
The government also said that it would issue new rules that will improve back-of-pack labelling to give consumers more information on sugar, fat and sugar content in foods.

Under the filing, the dairy cooperative has said to ordain that comparison between mayonnaise and butter is not permissible under Indian law.
In the lawsuit, Amul made it clear that while the promo was not naming Amul's butter product specifically, a generic disparagement of a rival product without specifically identifying it was objectionable.

Fruit and vegetable exporters were amongst the businesses hoping to tap into a market which borders Thailand - trade that would facilitate the cheap export of many fresh food products.","['vegetables', 'sector', 'push', 'tropical', 'producers', 'food', 'fruit', 'week', 'promote', 'thai', 'exports', 'boost', 'trade', 'thailand']",Acute climatological event (droughts),20.78055876

China is currently faced with the problem of feeding a population that is currently estimated at between 1.2 and 1.4 billion people.
The five days of talks in Beijing involved Brazilian government leaders from both country's as well as Chinese cabinet ministers, states governors and around 450 business leaders.
In the last year three years total trade between the two nations has increased five-fold to €8 billion, much of that derived from the trade in soya beans.
The growth in arable land use is being largely attributed to the planting of soy crops, which the government says could solve China's short falls in domestic demand.","['soya', 'supply', 'land', 'soy', 'met', 'million', 'solve', 'chinese', 'problem', 'increasing', 'trade', 'currently', 'brazilian', 'china', 'leading']",Trade Dispute,13.98451934

One Thai trader told Reuters that domestic supply of feed is not sufficient to satisfy the demand to restock.
Thai poultry exports to the EU are enormous - the UK alone imports over 40,000 tonnes each year.
The move is supported by the Vietnam Husbandry Feed Association, which represents 138 feed processors in the country.
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that countries affected by the deadly avian influenza virus H5N1 should not restock their flocks too quickly to avoid the disease flaring up again.","['early', 'disease', 'feed', 'country', 'restock', 'spread', 'vietnam', 'thai', 'poultry', 'virus', 'thailand']",pandemic,4.686825013

At times the discussions have been heated and certain issues, such as quotas, have proved to be extremely tricky, but the two countries finally signed an official free trade agreement in October last year.
Lychee and longan are among the main fruit crops in Thailand.
Australia has its own small lychee and longan fruit industry which, until now, has been protected by the ban on imports from Thailand.
Thai authorities estimates that in the three months since the agreement was introduced Thai fruit and vegetable exports to China have increased by 80 per cent.","['crops', 'market', 'longan', 'australia', 'fruit', 'free', 'agreement', 'hit', 'thai', 'lychee', 'trade', 'thailand']",Acute climatological event (heat stress),17.8383737

Currently Vietnamese imports of Chinese products are a trickle, compared to the exports it makes to the huge China market.
Currently around 2 per cent of the total imports from China are actually foodstuffs, backing the governments claim that such trade is largely restricted to the border regions.
On the other hand, Vietnamese foodstuff exports currently amount to around $400 million worth of agricultural products a year.
