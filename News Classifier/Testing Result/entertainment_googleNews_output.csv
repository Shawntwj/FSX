Online gamers grew 20 per cent to reach 360 million in 2020, it said.Transaction-based game revenues grew 21 per cent, despite adverse regulation in certain states, while casual gaming revenues rose 7 per cent, it added.According to the report, the largest absolute contributor to the fall of the sector was the filmed entertainment segment which declined to Rs 7,200 crore in 2020 from Rs 11,900 crore for 2019.While theatrical revenues plummeted to less than a quarter of their 2019 levels, a portion of this loss was made up through higher digital rights revenues which almost doubled during 2020 to Rs 3,500 crore,"" it said.However, the stoppage in production for over six months had its impact, which will now only recover once a healthy slate of films is made ready for release and the fear of stepping into crowded places subsides.The report estimated TV, film and music would take one to two years, assuming that there are no further setbacks, while traditional print, radio, OOH would take beyond three years.It further said the M&E sector has gone medium agnostic, given the fact that now video, audio, text and experiences are available across almost all segments.The sector is redefining itself across these 4 verticals - Video (TV, video OTT), Experiential (Online gaming, cinemas, events, OOH), Textual (print, online news) and Audio (radio, music, audio OTT), it said.","pandemichit, 2020, report, log, online, revenues, entertainment, growth, segment, rs, sector, crore, 2021, gaming, cent, media",idiosyncratic,16.891176160767664
