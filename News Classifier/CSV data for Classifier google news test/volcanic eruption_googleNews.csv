Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano, erupted Wednesday, emitting a river of lava onto the mountain below and gas clouds into the sky.

The eruption set off the volcano's longest lava flow since the danger level for Merapi was raised in November, Hanik Humaida, the head of Yogyakarta's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center, told The Associated Press. Sounds of the eruption could reportedly be heard almost 18 miles away.

The 9,737-foot volcano sits on the densely populated island of Java and near the ancient city of Yogyakarta. It has repeatedly erupted recently, keeping local officials and residents living nearby on a state of alert.

In November, local authorities evacuated nearly 2,000 people who lived in the Java mountain districts of Magelang and Sleman after Merapi erupted. Earlier this month, authorities evacuated more than 500 people in Magelang after the volcano spewed hot clouds of ash.

No residents were evacuated as of 5:30 a.m. EST, but Indonesian authorities are closely monitoring the volcano's activity. People were told to stay out of the 3-mile danger zone around the crater.

Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people.

Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, sits along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the ocean. That location leaves the country prone to earthquakes, volcanic activity and tsunamis.

In August, Indonesia's Mount Sinabung, located on Sumatra Island, spewed a plume of ash several miles into the sky posing health and aviation risks for days.

A series of eruptions in 2018 at the Anak Krakatau volcano, which also triggered a deadly tsunami, caused serious damage and forced authorities to reroute flights."

It was Mount Merapi's biggest eruption since authorities raised its danger level in November.

After morning rain, ash-fall turned into muck in several villages, where the sound of eruption could be heard 30 kilometres away.

The 2,968-metre volcano is on the densely populated island of Java and near the ancient city of Yogyakarta.

Police and rescue services evacuated people in some villages to temporary shelters in the Sleman regency near the city.

Local tour guide Wandha, who like many Indonesians only goes by their first name, told the ABC that people in the area are ""traumatised"".

Authorities in November had evacuated nearly 2,000 people living on the mountain in Magelang and Sleman districts, but most have since returned.

""Residents [around the volcano] mostly rely on making a living from nature, and when the main source of income was forcibly stopped, it cost us significantly,"" he said.

""It's difficult to find fodder, and our needs continue as usual without having any income.""

He said many now relied on selling their farm animals or doing odd-jobs.

The volcanic activity of Merapi was recorded as ""very high"" by Yogyakarta's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Centre on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Mount Merapi is the most active volcano among the dozens across Indonesia's ring of fire.

It has spewed clouds of ash and spurts of lava several times since November, triggering hundreds of earthquakes and dozens of landslides in the area.

Some 2,000 local residents had fled their homes in the Sleman and Magelang districts near to the volcano after a series of eruptions, but had begun to return.

Local authorities said they were prepared to evacuate people again if necessary and told people to stay clear of the 5 kilometer (3 mile) danger zone around the crater.

""We are taking inventory of vehicles that will be used to transport villagers,"" the head of the local civil protection agency, Makwan, was quoted as saying by the Antara news agency.

""So far no ash rain has been observed in residential areas,"" he said.

Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java, spewed hot clouds as far away as 4.5 kilometers (nearly 3 miles) on Saturday.

There were no immediate evacuations, but the National Disaster Mitigation Agency warned people who live in the villages on the slopes of the 3,676-meter (12,060-foot)-high mountain to be vigilant in looking for signs of danger.

Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati said that people around the river basin on the slopes of the mountain should beware of high rainfall intensity that can trigger lava floods.

Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center did not raise Semeru's alert status, which already had been at the third-highest level since it began erupting in May. The volcano spewed hot ash for 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in early December, triggering panic among villagers.

One is a sorcerer’s toolbox including dozens of amulets, rings, statuettes and other good luck charms made of ivory, bronze, glazed ceramics and amber — that were clearly not enough to protect the city from doom.

“It’s one of the most peculiar things we found during our excavations: amulets we found in a box in a house… which seem to belong to a woman — or a man, perhaps — who used magic,"" said Massimo Osanna, the director of the Pompeii archaeological park near Naples in southern Italy.

He was speaking at the inauguration of the Antiquarium, a refurbished museum housing bronze statues, frescoes, gold and silver jewels as well as the haunting casts of those killed when Vesuvius erupted in October 79 AD.

“You have some of the most important objects uncovered here since the 19th century. So really, this Antiquarium takes you through the centuries of Pompeii’s history, up until the fateful day of the eruption,"" Osanna told AFP.

The room that chronicles the last days of the city is “the most poignant part (of the exhibition),"" the Italian archaeologist added.

The plaster casts of the dead, including small children, were made by filling voids left by their bodies in the calcified layers of ash.

Osanna has headed the Pompeii park since 2014 and overseen a major conservation project, mostly funded by the European Union, which revitalised a UNESCO world heritage site formerly plagued by neglect and building collapses.

Last month, archaeologists announced the unique discovery of a thermopolium, a fast-food bar.

It had surviving polychrome decorations and traces of food and wine that offered an unprecedented glimpse of the snacking habits of the ancient Romans.

A team found duck bone fragments as well as the remains of pigs, goats, fish and snails in earthenware pots, one of which “gave off a very strong stench of wine"", archaeologist Teresa Virtuoso said.

The frescoes decorating the site included electioneering slogans and graffiti, scribbled over the image of a dog, in which a man — presumed to be a former slave — was accused of practising sex with dogs.

In 2019, Pompeii had more than 3.9 million visitors, making it Italy’s third most popular tourist destination after the Colosseum and Roman forum complex and the Uffizi Galleries in Florence.

But, like most other cultural sites in Italy, it has been mostly shut in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It reopened on January 18 but has admitted fewer than 100 visitors per day, compared to a pre-Covid-19 average of around 8,000.

“We’ve lost 80 percent of our visitors, and this also means 80 percent of our ticket revenues,"" Osanna said, adding that the site had to rely on generous subsidies from the Italian culture ministry to keep going.

On Monday, the vast archaeological park looked deserted, save for the journalists who came for the museum opening and the usual presence of archaeologists, restorers, guardians and unemployed tourist guides.

Its current state is surreal, but Osanna said it was nevertheless a great time to visit.

“It is almost as if you can see Pompeii’s inner soul, its spirit,"" he said.

“This is an abandoned city, and seeing it empty of tourists perhaps makes you think harder about the dreadful catastrophe that forever ended life here and reduced to silence a place that was bustling.""

9,2021-01-21 00:00:00,Reawakened geyser does not foretell Yellowstone volcanic eruptions: Analysis of Steamboat Geyser also finds relationship between column height and reservoir depth,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/01/210104170104.htm,"Also, no sequence of Steamboat eruptions other than the one that started in 2018 occurred after periods of high seismic activity.
To explore the reasons for Steamboat Geyser's variability, the team assembled records related to 109 eruptions going back to its reactivation in 2018.
In the spring and early summer, with melting snow and rain, the underground water pressure pushes more water into the underground reservoir, providing more hot water to erupt more frequently.
Because the hot water in geysers continually dissolves and redeposits silica -- every time Steamboat Geyser erupts, it brings up about 200 kilograms, or 440 pounds of dissolved silica.
Studies of water eruptions from geysers could give insight into the eruptions of hot rock from volcanoes, he said.","relationship, foretell, geysers, higher, yellowstone, water, geyser, team, height, variable, reawakened, finds, eruptions, steamboat, hot, volcanic, reservoir",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"When Yellowstone National Park's Steamboat Geyser -- which shoots water higher than any active geyser in the world -- reawakened in 2018 after three and a half years of dormancy, some speculated that it was a harbinger of possible explosive volcanic eruptions within the surrounding geyser basin. These so-called hydrothermal explosions can hurl mud, sand and rocks into the air and release hot steam, endangering lives; such an explosion on White Island in New Zealand in December 2019 killed 22 people.

A new study by geoscientists who study geysers throws cold water on that idea, finding few indications of underground magma movement that would be a prerequisite to an eruption. The geysers sit just outside the nation's largest and most dynamic volcanic caldera, but no major eruptions have occurred in the past 70,000 years.

""Hydrothermal explosions -- basically hot water exploding because it comes into contact with hot rock -- are one of the biggest hazards in Yellowstone,"" said Michael Manga, professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and the study's senior author. ""The reason that they are problematic is that they are very hard to predict; it is not clear if there are any precursors that would allow you to provide warning.""

He and his team found that, while the ground around the geyser rose and seismicity increased somewhat before the geyser reactivated and the area currently is radiating slightly more heat into the atmosphere, no other dormant geysers in the basin have restarted, and the temperature of the groundwater propelling Steamboat's eruptions has not increased. Also, no sequence of Steamboat eruptions other than the one that started in 2018 occurred after periods of high seismic activity.

""We don't find any evidence that there is a big eruption coming. I think that is an important takeaway,"" he said.

The study will be published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Manga, who has studied geysers around the world and created some in his own laboratory, set out with his colleagues to answer three main questions about Steamboat Geyser: Why did it reawaken? Why is its period so variable, ranging from 3 to 17 days? and Why does it spurt so high?

The team found answers to two of those questions. By comparing the column heights of 11 different geysers in the United States, Russia, Iceland and Chile with the estimated depth of the reservoir of water from which their eruptions come, they found that the deeper the reservoir, the higher the eruption jet. Steamboat Geyser, with a reservoir about 25 meters (82 feet) below ground, has the highest column -- up to 115 meters, or 377 feet -- while two geysers that Manga measured in Chile were among the lowest -- eruptions about a meter (3 feet) high from reservoirs 2 and 5 meters below ground.

""What you are really doing is you are filling a container, it reaches a critical point, you empty it and then you run out of fluid that can erupt until it refills again,"" he said. ""The deeper you go, the higher the pressure. The higher the pressure, the higher the boiling temperature. And the hotter the water is, the more energy it has and the higher the geyser.""

To explore the reasons for Steamboat Geyser's variability, the team assembled records related to 109 eruptions going back to its reactivation in 2018. The records included weather and stream flow data, seismometer and ground deformation readings, and observations by geyser enthusiasts. They also looked at previous active and dormant periods of Steamboat and nine other Yellowstone geysers, and ground surface thermal emission data from the Norris Geyser Basin.

They concluded that variations in rainfall and snow melt were probably responsible for part of the variable period, and possibly for the variable period of other geysers as well. In the spring and early summer, with melting snow and rain, the underground water pressure pushes more water into the underground reservoir, providing more hot water to erupt more frequently. During winter, with less water, lower groundwater pressure refills the reservoir more slowly, leading to longer periods between eruptions. Because the water pushed into the reservoir comes from places even deeper than the reservoir, the water is decades or centuries old before it erupts back to the surface, he said.

In October, Manga's team members demonstrated the extreme impact water shortages and drought can have on geysers. They showed that Yellowstone's iconic Old Faithful Geyser stopped erupting entirely for about 100 years in the 13th and 14th centuries, based on radiocarbon dating of mineralized lodgepole pine trees that grew around the geyser during its dormancy. Normally the water is too alkaline and the temperature too high for trees to grow near active geysers. The dormancy period coincided with a lengthy warm, dry spell across the Western U.S. called the Medieval Climate Anomaly, which may have caused the disappearance of several Native American civilizations in the West.

""Climate change is going to affect geysers in the future,"" Manga said.

Manga and his team were unable to determine why Steamboat Geyser started up again on March 15, 2018, after three years and 193 days of inactivity, though the geyser is known for being far more variable than Old Faithful, which usually goes off about every 90 minutes. They could find no definitive evidence that new magma rising below the geyser caused its reactivation.

The reactivation may have to do with changes in the internal plumbing, he said. Geysers seem to require three ingredients: heat, water and rocks made of silica -- silicon dioxide. Because the hot water in geysers continually dissolves and redeposits silica -- every time Steamboat Geyser erupts, it brings up about 200 kilograms, or 440 pounds of dissolved silica. Some of this silica is deposited underground and may change the plumbing system underneath the geyser. Such changes could temporarily halt or reactivate eruptions if the pipe gets rerouted, he said.

Manga has experimented with geysers in his lab to understand why they erupt periodically, and at least in the lab, it appears to be caused by loops or side chambers in the pipe that trap bubbles of steam that slowly dribble out, heating the water column above until all the water can boil from the top down, explosively erupting in a column of water and steam.

Studies of water eruptions from geysers could give insight into the eruptions of hot rock from volcanoes, he said.

""What we asked are very simple questions and it is a little bit embarrassing that we can't answer them, because it means there are fundamental processes on Earth that we don't quite understand,"" Manga said. ""One of the reasons we argue we need to study geysers is that if we can't understand and explain how a geyser erupts, our hope for doing the same thing for magma is much lower."""

HONOLULU -- Lava spattered and flowed over the weekend inside the crater of a Hawaii volcano that began erupting in December.

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the lava is confined to the summit crater of Kilauea, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday.

The eruption began Dec. 20 within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. The observatory said there was no data to indicate magma is moving into either of Kilauea’s rift zones — areas where the volcano is splitting apart.

Vents on the northwest side of the crater spattered Saturday while erupting lava flowed through crusted-over channels into a lava lake that has formed in the crater.

The lake was about a tenth of a square mile and about 620 feet (189 meters) deep, with a narrow black ledge surrounding the area, the observatory said.

A small island of cooler, solidified lava floated in the lava lake, rising about 20 feet (6 meters) above the surface, scientists said.

A report by the observatory in the Hawaii Herald-Tribune on Sunday said the primary hazard from the eruption is volcanic air pollution produced by the gases emitted at the summit.

The lava lake would need to rise about 262 feet (80 meters) before reaching a level that could be visible to the public from Kilauea Overlook in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the observatory said.

After two weeks of spewing tons of lava, the erupting vent has taken the form of a “dome fountain,” which resembles a red-hot balloon floating atop a lake of lava.

“Dome fountains can occur when lava rapidly emerges from a constricted vent or fissure onto the surface or, as in this case, beneath the surface of a lava lake. ... The result is a rolling upwelling of lava,” the U.S. Geological Survey wrote in a Jan. 5 Facebook post.

“The feature resembles, in part, a bubbling water fountain. The height of the dome fountain was estimated to be about 5 m (16 ft) with an estimated width of 10 m (33 ft).”

On Jan. 7, experts said they suspected the fountain is being fed by at least two sources.

The volcano, located inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, has been erupting for two weeks and has maintained a steady flow of lava since Dec. 26, the USGS says. It’s currently producing about 100,000 gallons of lava per minute, experts say.

Enough molten magma has spewed out to create an 70-acre lava lake that is about 630 feet deep, officials say. The 35 million cubic yards of lava remains within the walls of the volcano’s Halemaumau crater. (A 7-acre island formed in the lake, and has been seen drifting around, the USGS reports.)

The flow of lava has been such that the vent is now drowning, which forces the lava to emerge from “roofed vertical channels,” the USGS reports. The “vigorous” dome fountain was first recorded on Jan. 2, the USGS says in its video.

Dome fountains have been observed during eruptions at multiple volcanoes in Hawaii, including a rare ”symmetrical dome fountain” that reached 65 feet in height at Kilauea Volcano in 1969, according to a USGS tweet.

New research answers a longstanding question about explosive volcanic eruptions like the ones at Mount St. Helens in 1980, the Philippines’ Mount Pinatubo in 1991, or Chile’s Mount Chaitén in 2008.

Microscopic bubbles can tell stories about Earth’s biggest volcanic eruptions. Now, geoscientists have discovered some of those stories are written in nanoparticles.

Geoscientists have long sought to use tiny bubbles in erupted lava and ash to reconstruct some of the conditions, like heat and pressure, that occur in these powerful eruptions. But there’s been a historic disconnect between numerical models that predict how many bubbles will form and the actual amounts of bubbles measured in erupted rocks.

The researchers worked for more than five years to reconcile those differences for Plinian eruptions. Named in honor of Pliny the Younger, the Roman author who described the eruption that destroyed Pompeii in CE 79, Plinian eruptions are some of the most intense and destructive volcanic events.

“Eruption intensity refers to the both the amount of magma that’s erupted and how quickly it comes out,” says Sahand Hajimirza, a postdoctoral researcher and former PhD student in Helge Gonnermann’s lab in the earth, environmental, and planetary sciences department at Rice University.

“The typical intensity of Plinian eruptions ranges from about 10 million kilograms per second to 10 billion kilograms per second. That is equivalent to 5,000 to 5 million pickup trucks per second.”

One way scientists can gauge the speed of rising magma is by studying microscopic bubbles in erupted lava and ash. Like bubbles in uncorked champagne, magma bubbles are created by a rapid decrease in pressure. In magma, this causes dissolved water to escape in the form of gas bubbles.

“As magma rises, its pressure decreases,” Hajimirza says. “At some point, it reaches a pressure at which water is saturated, and further decompression causes supersaturation and the formation of bubbles.”

As water escapes in the form of bubbles, the molten rock becomes less saturated. But if the magma continues to rise, decreasing pressure increases saturation.

“This feedback determines how many bubbles form,” Hajimirza says. “The faster the magma rises, the higher the decompression rate and supersaturation pressure, and the more abundant the nucleated bubbles.”

In Plinian eruptions, so much magma rises so fast that the number of bubbles is staggering. When Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, for example, it spewed more than one cubic kilometer of rock and ash in nine hours, and there were about one million billion bubbles in each cubic meter of that erupted material.

“The total bubbles would be around a septillion,” Hajimirza says. “That’s a one followed by 24 zeros, or about 1,000 times more than all the grains of sand on all Earth’s beaches.”

In his PhD studies, Hajimirza developed a predictive model for bubble formation and worked with James Gardner, a professor of geological sciences in University of Texas’s Jackson School of Geosciences, to test the model in experiments at UT Austin. The new study builds upon that work by examining how magnetite crystals no larger than a few billionths of a meter could change how bubbles form at various depths.

“When bubbles nucleate, they can form in liquid, which we call homogeneous nucleation, or they can nucleate on a solid surface, which we call heterogeneous,” Hajimirza says. “A daily life example would be boiling a pot of water. When bubbles form on the bottom of the pot, rather than in the liquid water, that is heterogeneous nucleation.”

Bubbles from the bottom of the pot are often the first to form, because heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation typically begin at different temperatures. In rising magma, heterogeneous bubble formation begins earlier, at lower supersaturation levels. And the surfaces where bubbles nucleate are often on tiny crystals.

“How much they facilitate nucleation depends on the type of crystals,” Hajimirza says. “Magnetites, in particular, are the most effective.”

In the study, the researchers incorporated magnetite-mediated nucleation in numerical models of bubble formation and found the models produced results that agreed with observational data from Plinian eruptions.

Hajimirza says magnetites are likely present in all Plinian magma. And while previous research on hasn’t revealed enough magnetites to account for all observed bubbles, previous studies may have missed small nanocrystals that would only be revealed with transmission electron microscopy, a rarely used technique that is only now becoming more broadly available.

To find out if that’s the case, the researchers called for a “systematic search for magnetite nanolites” in material from Plinian eruptions. That would provide observational data to better define the role of magnetites and heterogeneous nucleation in bubble formation, and could lead to better models and improved volcanic forecasts.

“Forecasting eruptions is a long-term goal for volcanologists, but it’s challenging because we cannot directly observe subsurface processes,” says Hajimirza. “One of the grand challenges of volcano science, as outlined by the National Academies in 2017, is improving eruption forecasting by better integration of the observational data we have with the quantitative models, like the one we developed for this study.”

The study appears in Nature Communications.

Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park is the world's tallest active geyser, shooting water between 90 and 120 meters (300-400 feet) high. Unlike other geysers, Steamboat does not erupt on a predictable schedule, with recorded intervals between major eruptions ranging from three days to fifty years. The geyser's first documented activity was in 1878. The geyser was dormant from 1911 to 1961. In 2018 it reactivated after three and a half years of dormancy, prompting speculations about an imminent reawakening of the Yellowstone supervolcano. The major geyser fields sit just outside the volcanic caldera, but no major eruptions have occurred here in the past 70,000 years.

A new study by geoscientists published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that geyser activity is not directly linked to underground magma movement that would be a prerequisite to an eruption.

Michael Manga, professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and the study's senior author, and his team found that, while the ground around the geyser rose and seismicity increased somewhat before the geyser reactivated and the area currently is radiating slightly more heat into the atmosphere, no other dormant geysers in the basin have restarted, and the temperature of the groundwater propelling Steamboat's eruptions has not increased. Also, no sequence of Steamboat eruptions other than the one that started in 2018 occurred after periods of high seismic activity.

The activity of Steamboat Geyser is more likely linked to the morphology of its underground plumbing system and precipitation patterns in Yellowstone.

By comparing the eruption heights of 11 different geysers in the United States, Russia, Iceland and Chile with the estimated depth of the reservoir of water from which their eruptions come, the researchers found that the deeper the reservoir, the higher the eruption jet. Steamboat Geyser, with a reservoir about 25 meters (82 feet) below ground, has the highest column - up to 122 meters, or 400 feet - while two geysers studied in Chile were among the lowest, with eruptions about a meter (3 feet) high from reservoirs 2 and 5 meters below ground.

The deeper the geyser's plumbing system goes, the higher the water's weight and pressure on the bottom. The higher the pressure, the higher the boiling temperature. And the hotter the water is, the more energy it has and the higher the resulting steam eruption.

The researchers also compared the timing of 109 eruptions going back to the geyser's reactivation in 2018 with variables like seismic activity, ground deformation rates, weather and streamflow data. They also looked at previous active and dormant periods of Steamboat and nine other Yellowstone geysers and ground surface thermal emission data from the Norris Geyser Basin. The intensity of tremors, ground deformation rates, and thermal emissions are used to monitor partially molten rock movements in the underground of Yellowstone.

Finding no correlation between seismic activity and eruption intervals, the study concludes that variations in rainfall and snowmelt were probably responsible for part of the variable eruption activity, and possibly for the variable period of other geysers as well. In the spring and early summer, with melting snow and rain, the underground water pressure pushes more water into the underground reservoir, providing more hot water to erupt more frequently. During winter, with less water, lower groundwater pressure refills the reservoir more slowly, leading to longer periods between eruptions.

Long-term activity is likely controlled by the rising or falling groundwater table, drought periods reflecting a decrease in geyser activity, as happened before 1961 and 2018 at Steamboat Geyser."

“I remember my first visit to the lava tunnel with a cousin who is studying Geology. I had never seen such a landform in Maharashtra. I had seen caves and crevices but walking into a tunnel was an entirely different experience. It is neither too big a place nor too tiny. It was dark and we were not sure what to expect. Would there be bats, scorpions, snakes or water? However, we now know that it’s safe to go there and experience its charm,” says Sushil Chikane of ‘Journeys’.

He adds that the group would meet at the foothills and, after breakfast, make the short climb to the caves and, then, to the tunnel before returning to base by lunchtime. “The cave contains engravings and statues of Buddhist and Hindu deities and were carved out of a single rock formation around the 3rd and 4th centuries CE,” says Chikane.

With the Covid protocol still in place, small groups will be taken with experts and an adventure team to ensure safety. “It is an easy climb for young people as well as senior citizens,” says Chikane, adding that the people of Pune, who enjoy the outdoors, have graduated from flocking to hill stations to exploring natural delights such as waterbodies around the city and taking up physical activities such as cycling and hiking.

The time for curiosity about Geology is yet to come. “We thought about clubbing Geology and travel on this trip,” he says.

He adds that the state sits on a dormant volcano and lava tubes and distributaries have been studied in Western Deccan Volcanic Province. “Unlike the volcanoes that we see in films, where the crest of the mountain bursts, the one in Maharashtra is of the kind where there were a lot of cracks in the flatland. Due to tectonic movements, the lava flowed out and melted the rocks of the hill. It left channels of lava that we will be trying to understand during the visit,” says Chikane. The trip will be on till January 10.

USF's numerical volcano model

The team from USF developed an advanced numerical model that allows users to simulate and accurately reconstruct ancient eruption rates. The model estimates the dimensions of the umbrella clouds that have deposited huge amounts of ashes and minerals in the past millennia.

The team, led by USF doctoral candidate Robert Constantinescu, was able to reconstruct a 2,500-year-old eruption of a volcano in Ecuador.

Current measurements of old eruptions are reliant on deposits ejected over large areas. These deposits erode over time and can give inaccurate readings, Constantinescu explained in a press statement.

Reconstructing umbrella clouds

The USF team's work shows that the dimensions of the umbrella cloud are crucial in reconstructing the trajectory of old eruptions.

""The better we can reconstruct the nature of past eruptions from deposit data, the better we can anticipate potential hazards associated with future explosive eruptions,"" the team wrote in the new journal article.

The researchers applied their model to the tephra deposit of the eruption that occurred at Pululagua, a now dormant volcano located approximately 50 miles (80.5 km) north of the capital city of Quito.

""If in modern times the umbrella clouds of large eruptions are easily observed, we now have the ability to estimate the umbrella clouds of past eruptions,” Constantinescu said. ""Our numerical model enables us to better characterize past volcanic eruptions and inform models for future hazard assessment."""

ROME (AP) — Mount Etna, the volcano that towers over eastern Sicily, evokes superlatives. It is Europe’s most active volcano and also the continent’s largest.

And the fiery, noisy show of power it puts on for days or weeks, even years every so often, is always super spectacular. Fortunately, Etna’s latest eruption captivating the world’s attention has caused neither injuries nor evacuation.

But each time it roars back into dramatic action, it wows onlookers and awes geologists who spend their careers monitoring its every quiver, rumble and belch.

WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW?

On Feb. 16, Etna erupted, sending up high fountains of lava, which rolled down the mountain’s eastern slope toward the uninhabited Bove Valley, which is five kilometers (three miles) wide and eight kilometers (five miles) long. The volcano has belched out ash and lava stones that showered the southern side.

The activity has been continuing since, in bursts more or less intense. The flaming lava lights up the night sky in shocking hues of orange and red. There’s no telling how long this round of exciting activity will last, say volcanologists who work at the Etna Observatory run by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology.

While public fascination began with the first dramatic images this month, the explosive activity began in September 2019, becoming much stronger two months ago. The current activity principally involves the south-east crater, which was created in 1971 from a series of fractures.

HARD TO MISS

Etna towers 3,350 meters (around 11,050 feet) above sea level and is 35 kilometers (22 miles) in diameter, although the volcanic activity has changed the mountain’s height over time.

Occasionally, the airport at Catania, eastern Sicily’s largest city, has to close down for hours or days, when ash in the air makes flying in the area dangerous. Early in this recent spell of eruptive activity, the airport closed briefly.

But for pilots and passengers flying to and from Catania at night when the volcano is calmer, a glimpse of fiery red in the dark sky makes for an exciting sight.

LIVING WITH A VOLCANO

With Etna’s lava flows largely contained to its uninhabited slopes, life goes in towns and villages elsewhere on the mountain. Sometimes, like in recent days, lava stones rain down on streets, bounce off cars and rattle roofs.

But many residents generally find that a small inconvenience when weighted against the benefits the volcano brings. Lava flows have left fertile farmland. Apple and citrus trees flourish. Etna red and whites are some of Sicily’s most popular wines, from grapes grown on the volcanic slopes.

Tourism rakes in revenues. Hikers and backpackers enjoy views of the oft-puffing mountain and the sparkling Ionian Sea below. For skiers who want uncrowded slopes, Etna’s a favorite.

IT CAN BE DEADLY

Inspiring ancient Greek legends, Etna has had scores of known eruptions in its history. An eruption in 396 B.C. has been credited with keeping the army of Carthage at bay.

In 1669, in what has been considered the volcano’s worst known eruption, lava buried a swath of Catania, about 23 kilometers (15 miles) away and devastated dozens of villages. An eruption in 1928 cut off a rail route circling the mountain’s base.

More recently, in 1983, dynamite was used to divert lava threatening inhabited areas. In 1992, the army built an earthen wall to contain the lava, flowing from Etna for months, from hitting Zafferana Etnea, a village of a few thousand people. At one point, the smoking lava stopped two kilometers (just over a mile) from the edge of town.

Over the last century, a hiccup in geological time, low-energy explosive eruptions and lava flows, both fed from the summit and side vents, have characterized Etna."

Indonesia's Mount Merapi, one of the world's most active volcanoes, erupted on Friday, belching out fiery red lava.

The volcano, close to Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta on Java island, had already spewed lava almost two dozen times over the two last days and caused hundreds of minor volcanic quakes, according to a report by Indonesia's geological agency.

""This morning, lava avalanches were observed seven times,"" the agency said, with the lava travelling up to 700 metres to the southwest.

However, an official warning over the status of the volcano was unchanged at its second highest level, where it has remained since November last year.

Nearby residents were told to avoid the area within a five-kilometre radius of the crater and were warned about the lava as well as airborne volcanic material.

Last month, the volcano spewed huge clouds of smoke and ash that billowed down its sides.

Mount Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of around 280,000 residents from surrounding areas.

That was its most powerful eruption since 1930, when around 1,300 people were killed, while another explosion in 1994 took about 60 lives.

The Southeast Asian archipelago nation has nearly 130 active volcanoes.

Residents and municipal teams worked Wednesday to clean up a Sicilian village near Mount Etna after Europe's most active volcano spewed lava, ashes and volcanic stones.

The eruption, which featured spectacular displays of gushing lava, forced the temporary closure of Sicily's Catania Airport, a frequent occurrence when Etna is in an active phase.

As Tuesday's volcanic activity was largely expected, areas surrounding the crater were secured and there were no reported injuries or deaths. But nearby residents said the eruption was unusual in that big chunks of volcanic stones carpeted the area, not just ash.

""It was a rain of stones. Something I never saw in my entire life,"" Pedara resident Letizia Olivieri said.

Pedara Mayor Alfio Cristaudo said the village was in emergency mode from the extent of the eruption.

""The entire territory of Pedara and all the streets are covered in volcanic ashes and lapillus,"" or volcanic stones, he said.

Residents and local teams cleaned streets, courtyards and cars, bagging the ash and waiting for municipal collectors to take it away. Driving motorbikes and scooters was forbidden, and the speed limit for cars was reduced to limit the further spread of ash.

by Divya Agarwala | February 9, 2021

“You Asked” is a series where Earth Institute experts tackle reader questions on science and sustainability. The following questions were submitted for volcanologist Einat Lev following her talk, “Why We Need a Volcanic Eruption of Data.” In the talk, which was filmed as a part of the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory’s 2020 Open House at Home, Lev says that more monitoring of volcanoes could help to save lives.

Watch the short talk here, and read Lev’s responses to reader questions below.

Why is it difficult to get real-time eruption information in the Information Age?

The technology to acquire pre-eruption information exists for the most part, but, unfortunately, only very few places have enough sensors already in place. Getting instruments on volcanoes can sometimes be difficult because they can be remote, dangerous, or just complicated to work at (e.g., at national parks or private lands). Usually only one researcher goes to a site, because it can be prohibitively expensive to send a large, multidisciplinary team. So, overall, the technology to get eruption information exists, but it all comes down to economics.

How accurate are the predictions of volcanic eruptions? How much lead time is there between a prediction and an event?

Only about 20% of eruptions have an appropriate increase in the alert level before the eruption occurs. That’s pretty low considering the importance of warning citizens living near active volcanoes. Lead time can range anywhere from hours to days to months. It often varies based on the style of the volcano. For example, some volcanoes give off very few signs before erupting. Other times, you see an uptick in activity and think an eruption is coming soon, but then nothing happens for months.

It is difficult to gather enough data to find clear patterns in this wide range of volcanic behaviors. Many locations do not have adequate data due to financial constraints, but sometimes we are looking at the wrong signals. For example, some volcanoes have only one seismometer on them. If their pre-eruption upticks occur as increases in gas and not in rumbling that can be picked up as seismic waves, then there is inadequate data to predict lead times and for researchers to issue warnings.

Can you predict which volcanoes will have violent eruptions?

The general pattern is that volcanoes with more viscous magmas will have more violent eruptions. To elaborate, volcanoes on subduction zones have more water and silica, which generate viscosity, and their eruptions are more likely to be big and violent. However, it isn’t completely clear cut because predictions also depend on the size of the system and how quickly the magma moves up towards the surface. This is actually an active area of research. We are studying a volcano in Alaska, for example, which has mostly smooth lava eruptions, but every now and then, a violent blow. Researchers are comparing the development of these differing explosions.

How do you study volcanoes that are underwater?

Volcanoes underwater are harder to see directly, but it is actually easier to study their structure because we can view the area from above by sending seismic waves from a boat. These waves even reach the subsurface of the volcano, so we can see a view of what it looks like inside in much more detail and completeness than what we can do on land. Some underwater volcanoes, like Axial Seamount, off the coast of Oregon, are even equipped with cameras and pressure sensors.

Do solar activities or tidal forces have any effect on volcanic eruptions?

I haven’t seen any evidence of a link between solar activity and volcanoes but there is some documentation of a minor impact from tides. If a volcano is very close to erupting, there is a slightly higher likelihood that it will erupt when there is a change in force induced by tides. Maybe someone will find a link with the activity of the sun, that’s the beauty of science; we can just ask a question and run an experiment on it.

How has the pandemic affected volcanology?

The pandemic has severely impacted the ability to do field work and travel, but it has also led to opportunities to interact with colleagues who live far away by inviting them to remote seminars and workshops, so there is a silver lining. As a general trend, I think the pandemic has highlighted the importance of direct and accurate scientific communication. People need to understand what is going on and how science affects what they are experiencing."

In 1994, astronauts on the STS-068 mission on Space Shuttle Endeavour captured a large eruption at Klyuchevskoy using a Hasselblad film camera.
Given the ongoing activity on Kamchatka Peninsula and the continued presence of humans in low-Earth orbit, the chances of photographing another volcanic eruption may just be an orbit away.","hints, lens, recent, klyuchevskoy, taken, earth, ash, eruption, astronauts, volcanic, space, kamchatka",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"The Kamchatka Peninsula of far eastern Russia has more than 300 volcanoes, 29 of which are active. This photo, taken by an astronaut onboard the International Space Station, captures a few of the region’s active volcanoes—with some showing signs of recent eruptions. The photo was taken at a highly oblique angle with a long camera lens, giving a strongly three-dimensional perspective of the towering peaks.

In this snow-covered landscape, the peaks of Klyuchevskoy and Bezymianny volcanoes are notably darker. The astronauts were able to see evidence of ash deposits from recent eruptions. Days before this photo was taken, Bezymianny had a significant ash eruption that was recorded by the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team. The plume drifted northwest and deposited ash in the valley between Bezymianny and Ushkovshy volcanoes.

Photographing an ongoing volcanic eruption anywhere on Earth is a matter of luck for most astronauts, but Klyuchevskoy is so active that it has actually been captured spewing ash several times. In 1994, astronauts on the STS-068 mission on Space Shuttle Endeavour captured a large eruption at Klyuchevskoy using a Hasselblad film camera. More recently, astronauts on the ISS took a similar oblique shot of a long plume extending from the volcano in 2013.

Given the ongoing activity on Kamchatka Peninsula and the continued presence of humans in low-Earth orbit, the chances of photographing another volcanic eruption may just be an orbit away.

Astronaut photograph ISS064-E-319 was acquired on October 23, 2020, with a Nikon D5 digital camera using a 1200 millimeter lens and is provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations Facility and the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, Johnson Space Center.

Yesterday’s string of unusual and powerful earthquakes, almost entirely localised in southwest Iceland, continued to give off seismic activity through the night. While larger quakes may be on the way, there is mercifully no indication that a volcanic eruption in the area is imminent.

Starting yesterday morning at around 10:00 Icelandic time, dozens of earthquakes of a magnitude greater than 3—with the largest being a 5.7—began to rumble in Reykjanes, Iceland’s southwestern peninsula. The area is especially seismically active, but the strength and frequency of the quakes was regarded as unusual by scientists who monitor this activity in Iceland.

RÚV reports that this activity continued through the night, with some 242 quakes recorded between midnight and 7:00 this morning. 20 had a magnitude greater than 2 and two were greater than 3, with a 3.1 recorded just after 1:00 and a 3.4 measured at around 3:30.

In all, 57 earthquakes of a magnitude greater than 3 have been measured since yesterday at 10:06.

Amongst the possible explanations for the quakes that was being explored was the chance that volcanoes in Reykjanes such as Mt. Þórbjörn were readying to erupt. Measurements taken of the volcanoes, however, showed that there were no signs of an impending eruption.

The southwest region has nonetheless been placed on high alert, as there is still a strong chance that earthquakes of an even greater magnitude may be on the way.

The two most reliable sources for earthquake and volcano activity—the home pages for the Icelandic Met Office and Civic Protection—crashed due to the ensuing web traffic those sites received. Vísir reports that 70,000 people trying to visit vedur.is at the same time crashed the server, and Civic Protection’s site was brought down as well.

Ingvar Kristinsson of the Icelandic Met Office told reporters that the site has experienced failures due to high traffic before, and are currently taking steps to be able to ensure that up to 100,000 people could conceivably visit the site at the same time without crashing it.

The morning has thus far been a calm one in Iceland, but the country continues to hold its breath for what may be larger quakes to come.

The sun was setting, twilight was soaking the soil, and the sky was not yet on fire. For the past few days, Mount Etna’s almost preternatural displays of liquid hot rage had come along like clockwork, spaced roughly 30 hours apart on the 16th, 18th, and 19th of February 2021. It was unusual for one of the world’s most active volcanoes to be so punctual. But suddenly, on the 20th, it seemed to have broken its cycle. Behncke, a volcanologist at the Etna Observatory of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), kept his vigil.

Then, as darkness arrived, tiny jets of incandescent material flung themselves out of the summit, high above eastern Sicily. A thin tongue of lava emerged a little later, and a jet of molten rock shot up few hundred feet. The real fun began at 1:30 a.m. Violent explosions threw volcanic bombs the size of fridges from the peak. Lava spouted up more than 3,300 feet, illuminating the volcano like a flare. A red-and-black shower of fresh volcanic matter rained down, partially obscured by the six-mile-high tower of ash piercing the inky blue sky. The volcano’s roars echoed among the houses of about a million people living on its slopes—Behncke included.

This scene seems frightening, but for most Sicilians, including those in the volcano’s shadow, this is just the volcano doing what it does best: building herself, paroxysm by paroxysm. And for volcanologists like Behncke, the recent eruptive tour de force has been one of the most spectacular sights they have ever seen.

Things kept getting better. On the night of the 22nd, an even more impressive episode sent lava fountains maybe 6,500 feet up, over twice the height of the world’s tallest skyscraper. Behncke says that his jaw hit the floor.

“I sent messages to people, I called friends and I said, ‘Look, this is happening here, and it is so fucking incredible, it’s way beyond belief,’” he says. “I mean it goes for half an hour with these huge jets and a fan of five, six fountains.” The volcanic yawps are great too. “The sound is what really makes it complete.”

At press time, Etna was in the middle of its sixth paroxysm, and Behncke can’t get enough. “This is the most beautiful volcano on Earth,” he tweeted a few days earlier. He could be a little biased—he’s lived on or around it for a quarter of a century, after all—but with a show so spectacular, who could question him?

Etna is a hyperactive volcano with over 3,500 years of historically documented eruptions. It’s been erupting on and off since September 2013. Since September 2019, it’s been erupting from its various summit craters virtually continuously. Back in December 2020, Etna’s explosive activity and lava output began to spike, and in February it has been launching lava skyward like it’s nothing.

Etna’s also a bit strange. This conical colossus can produce both explosive eruptions and those that ooze lava, sometimes simultaneously. This is a product of its weird plumbing system, one that’s capable of making runny magmas and gloopier, explosion-prone porridge, a feat of volcanic engineering that scientists are still trying to decipher.

This latest eruption appears to be coming up from the depths of the mantle, the plasticky layer beneath the Earth’s crust. Extremely hot, very fluid magma is rushing up through a labyrinth of rocky conduits. But there’s another factor that results in such beautiful lava fountains.

“Etna has astoundingly high quantities of water vapor in its magma, which is what makes it explode,” says Behncke. This water does nothing to cool the magma down. It is actually a very common volcanic gas that spends much of its time dissolved in the magma. As the molten rock approaches the surface, the pressure drops, and the bubbles of water vapor expand violently and whoosh, lava gets jettisoned out of the volcano.

“It is pretty much the champagne effect,” says Behncke.

After each episode of lava fountaining and bomb-throwing, the less gassy clumps of magma linger just below the vent, a bit like superhot phlegm stuck in a lithic esophagus. Then Etna clears its throat with a new volley of gassy magma from below, setting off another pyrotechnic performance. These moments of magmatic madness are known as volcanic paroxysms, a word taken from 19th-century medicine, when it was used to describe the most dramatic manifestations of an illness. (It’s still used for the cycle of chills, fever, and sweating of a malarial episode.)

With so many paroxysms back to back, Behncke has had his hands full and his brain scrambled. For the first few, he was the volcanologist on duty, which meant updating scientists, civil defense authorities, and others.

Etna’s singular strangeness makes it a joy to study.

Etna always keeps him on his toes, but its singular strangeness makes it a joy to study. “It displays most of the stuff we see on different volcanoes,” he says. In one hour, you can get tall columns of ash, lava fountains, lava flows, avalanches of hot ash and gas called pyroclastic density currents, concrete-like flows of muddy lava known as lahars, the explosive meeting of lava and snow, volcanic bomb launches, and maelstroms of ash-borne lightning. But because it is so huge, and the activity largely confined to its upper section, it is a little easier to appreciate for its aesthetic and scientific qualities. Often, says Behncke, “it is all not dangerous for the people living on it, so this is just wonderful.”

Behncke has followed Etna’s shenanigans ever since he was a child. He eventually found his way to Sicily when he was a geology student in Germany. “When I first came here in September 1989, Etna did exactly what it’s doing now,” he says, a parade of paroxysms, and at one point one of the mountain’s flanks was ripped open. “Etna showed me right then, this is what you’re going to have. That was almost traumatic for me. It was too much!” he says, laughing. “But then I got into it.”

After getting a PhD in Catania, the city to Etna’s south, he got a job with the INGV. He has watched Etna from various points on its flanks for the past 25 years. For the first 10, he lived in Catania, but was displeased that none offered a good view. When he got married and had a daughter, Behncke says, “We decided that we had to go to a place where we had a view of Etna.”

Initially they lived fairly far upslope, but for the past eight years they have lived in a village about 13 miles from the summit, but still on Etna. From home, he has a perfect, grand-scale view of the mountain’s eruptive entertainment. And this ongoing eruption has given him the highest lava fountains he has personally seen.

Does Etna ever get old? “It is always a delight,” he says, but life goes on. Sometimes, even when there are dozens of lava fountains erupting, a friend might call and ask if he’s watching. He tells them no, he’s reading a book. So every now and then, Etna does something cool out of nowhere while he isn’t watching. “Shit, I should have seen that one as well!” he says.

Today’s huge fountains are a visceral thrill. “They have a strong psychological effect, because it brings you back to those moments in the past,” says Behncke, moments over the years when he excitedly jumped into the car to improve his view, often bringing his family along. “It kind of keeps me younger maybe. Or at least it gives me the illusion.”

It’s not clear what’s going to happen next. The timing between the paroxysms doesn’t reliably indicate how powerful the next one will be, but for now they remain confined to the summit, far from anyone.

The paroxysms may simply stop. Many volcanoes, including Etna, can often look like they are gearing up for something cataclysmic, but ultimately, says Behncke, all they do is “a little poop.” There is also non-zero chance that these paroxysms could ramp up, or that Etna’s magma tries to find another way out of the volcano and pushes through the slopes, causing a far more hazardous flank eruption, or even a collapse.

“This is something that will happen sooner or later. We hope not very soon, but it is Etna that decides,” says Behncke. There is no sign that this is coming at present. But inevitably, one day, it will. “And it could become ugly.”

But like most of those who live on or enjoy Etna, any anxiety he harbors is a distant second to appreciation. Sicilians don’t even call it Etna. They call it the “Lady Mountain.” “For many people it’s a female, a ‘super mamma,’” he says. It has great soil for wine, a great climate, it is great for tourism, and it’s a beautiful place to live. The occasional litterbug aside, “Most of the time the people are very proud of Etna. It gives us so many things.”

Its eruptions can and have been deadly, but these moments tend to pass quickly and fade into memory—and then life goes on. And like this current, fantastical display, most of its eruptions can simply be admired.

“The destructive and deadly events happen every now and then,” Behncke says,” but the benefits are there all the time.”

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council confirmed the precautionary evacuation in two villages in Talisay town but clarified that this was done due to recent volcanic activity, not because of a pending eruption.

At least 60 people living on the island were brought to the municipal social welfare office after tremors increased in the past 24 hours, the Philippine Coast Guard said.

Seismic activity

On Monday, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) warned of a slight increase in Taal’s seismic activities, as well as changes in the main crater lake. It reiterated a previous recommendation to bar entry into the volcano island, which locals call “Pulo.”In a bulletin on Tuesday, Phivolcs said the Taal Volcano Network recorded 98 tremors ranging from 5 to 12 minutes in the past 24 hours. The main crater emitted white steam-laden plumes that rose 5 meters. Volcanologists also recorded a slight deflation around the main crater since October last year, and noted the “very slow and steady inflation” of the Taal region since its eruption in January last year.

“Phivolcs reminds the public that at Alert Level 1, sudden stream-driven or phreatic explosions, volcanic earthquakes, minor ashfall and lethal accumulations or expulsions of volcanic gas can occur and threaten areas within the Taal Volcano Island,” the agency said in its bulletin.

“Local government units are advised to continuously assess previously evacuated barangays around Taal Lake for damage and road accessibilities,” it added.

No man’s land

Taal, the country’s second most active volcano, erupted in January last year, forcing hundreds of thousands of people within the 14-kilometer radius to flee their homes.

It spewed volcanic ash and gas, which was accompanied by volcanic quakes that shook the volcano island and nearby towns in Batangas.

More than a year after its eruption, the picturesque volcano transformed into a barren and desolate landscape. Several families still stayed in evacuation centers.

The government has declared Pulo a “no man’s land” and barred the return of about 8,000 people who had lived off farming, fishing and volcano tours on horseback. But caretakers of fish cages in the lake were allowed to return as the aquaculture industry started to recover. Ali Belina, a staff member of the Batangas Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said the provincial government was monitoring the situation and would look into reports of evacuation on the volcano island.

Tagaytay City Mayor Agnes Tolentino, whose city in Cavite province overlooks Taal, has appealed to the public to remain calm and alert, and monitor government reports on the situation.

“As of now, we do not see any need to evacuate Tagaytay residents,” Tolentino said in a post in Filipino on the city’s Facebook page on Tuesday.

“That kind of means we really need to go back and reevaluate the data that’s been collected in the last few decades.”—Mara Johnson-Groh (marakjg@gmail.com), Science WriterCitation:Johnson-Groh, M. (2021), Ancient eruption may change our understanding of modern volcanoes, Eos, 102, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EO154284.","carbon, change, volcanoes, bubbles, scientists, important, dioxide, modern, sunset, eruption, really, understanding, ancient, crater",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"A thousand years ago, a volcanic eruption in what is now northern Arizona sent a plume of gas 24 kilometers into the sky and lava flows streaming as far as 11 kilometers. It caused local populations to flee their homes and abandon nearby farms.

Now a new analysis of gases from Sunset Crater’s single, catastrophic eruption is surprising geologists and challenging long-standing assumptions about how such basaltic eruptions occur.

“Some of these volcanoes may actually be able to erupt in a similar manner to something like Mount St. Helens.”

Since volcanoes like Sunset Crater, called basaltic scoria cones, usually erupt only once, they don’t receive much of the attention their more active counterparts see. But the new research showed this eruption liberated disproportionally high amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur for the volume of material released, suggesting these scoria cones might be more impactful than previously thought.

“What we’re finding here is that some of these volcanoes may actually be able to erupt in a similar manner to something like Mount St. Helens,” said Chelsea Allison, lead author on the new paper and a postdoctoral researcher at the City College campus of the City University of New York. “It’s really important that we can understand how that’s happening…so that in the future, if such an event were to occur, we’d be prepared for what might happen.”

Discovering What Underscores Scoria Cones

Although the 1064 eruption of Sunset Crater rivaled the 1980 awakening of Mount St. Helens in terms of ejected material, Sunset Crater (located in the San Francisco volcanic fields spanning northern Arizona) is a much smaller volcano. Geologists at Arizona State University, led by Allison during her Ph.D. work, wanted to figure out why the scoria cone erupted in such a violent manner to help better understand the risks associated with these types of volcanoes.

Tiny gas bubbles trapped in melt inclusions, like this one from Sunset Crater, are helping scientists understand how much carbon dioxide and other gases are present before an eruption. Credit: Amanda Clarke, Arizona State University

“[Scoria cones] are the most common volcanic landforms,” Allison said. “There are just tons of these little, tiny pimples all over Earth’s surface, and they’re also really common throughout the entire solar system.”

Building on previous analysis of Sunset Crater’s ancient fissures and lava flows, the scientists studied tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside crystals in the lava. Less than a tenth of a centimeter long, these bubbles are trapped inside pockets known as melt inclusions found in crystals that form well before an eruption occurs, providing a tiny time capsule of what gases were present in the magma before they emerged and escaped into the atmosphere.

Using Raman spectroscopy, the scientists were able to analyze the amount and density of gases in the bubbles by comparing them to known standards created in the lab. The Sunset Crater bubbles were found to be primarily carbon dioxide.

Explosive Gases

Their results, published in Nature Communications in January, showed the carbon dioxide was trapped at a depth of around 15 kilometers and likely played a critical role in propelling the eruption to such explosive heights. The scientists aren’t exactly sure where the carbon dioxide came from, but it could be a result of long-brewing subduction in the region.

“If these bubbles are important in these monogentic systems—where they only erupt during one main phase of activity—and they’re important in these really active systems, they are probably important everywhere.”

Regardless of their origin, the high levels of carbon dioxide surprised the scientists and provided insight into what a similar eruption might be capable of. The Sunset Crater eruption sent 11 megatons of carbon dioxide and 6 megatons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, making basaltic cone eruptions a possibly overlooked source of atmospheric aerosols.

The new findings come 5 years after similar research first started showing the importance of melt inclusion bubbles in active volcanoes and is likely only the tip of the iceberg of research to come.

“If these bubbles are important in these monogentic systems—where they only erupt during one main phase of activity—and they’re important in these really active systems, they are probably important everywhere,” said Penny Wieser, a volcanologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the study. “That kind of means we really need to go back and reevaluate the data that’s been collected in the last few decades.”

Poland’s statement in the Yellowstone Volcanic Observatory’s monthly update asserted that existing rumors are completely false and that an eruption will likely not take place for several thousand years to come. To verify his claims Poland provided the scientific explanation behind an eruption.

“[This rumor] isn’t true. There’s two reasons why this is the case. The first is volcanoes don’t work that way. They don’t erupt on schedules. Volcanoes erupt when there is a sufficient supply of eruptable magma beneath the surface, and enough pressure to get that magma up to the surface, and right now neither of those conditions exists at Yellowstone,” said Poland.

He added that the magma chamber underneath the volcano is only 5-15% molten, which is not enough to generate a large eruption or explosion.

According to Yellowstone’s website, it has been 174,000 years since the volcano’s last large-scale eruption, which created the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since then, 60 smaller eruptions have occurred. The most recent of which took place 70,000 years ago.

“Over the last 15,000 years or so, since the last ice age, we know from the geology of Yellowstone Lake that Yellowstone has mostly gone down. In fact, it’s gone down by a net of 30 meters, almost 100 feet over that time period. So there’s no pressure and there’s really no magma to feed one of these really big explosions,” said Poland.

Additionally, Poland predicted that if the volcano erupted on schedule it still would not occur for another 100,000 years.

“631,000 years ago Yellowstone Caldera formed, before that was Henry’s Fork Caldera. That was 1.3 million years ago. Huckberry Ridge Caldera was 2.1 million years ago. If you look at the time period between those the average eruption interval between these eruptions is actually 725,000 years or so,” said Poland. “So point being, Yellowstone is not overdue and frankly, if you hear someone on a documentary or the internet saying ‘Yellowstone’s overdue,’ you know right off the bat that they don’t know what they’re talking about at all.”"

Tree rings and Iceland's Laki volcano eruption: A closer look at climate

When the Laki volcano erupted in 1783, its effects rippled around the world

February 3, 2021

By reading between the lines of tree rings, U.S. National Science Foundation-funded researchers at the University of Arizona reconstructed what happened in Alaska the year the Laki Volcano erupted half a world away in Iceland. What they learned can help fine-tune future climate predictions.

In June, 1783, Laki spewed more sulfur into the atmosphere than any other Northern Hemisphere eruption in the last 1,000 years. The Inuit in North America tell stories about the year summer never arrived. Benjamin Franklin, who was in France at the time, noted the ""fog"" that descended over much of Europe in the aftermath, and correctly reasoned that it led to an unusually cold winter on the continent.

Previous analyses of annual tree rings have shown that the entire 1783 growing season for the spruce trees in Alaska was colder than average. But Julie Edwards, a researcher at UArizona, reasoned that since Laki erupted in June, it doesn't make sense to assume that the entire growing season, which starts in May for the trees, was cooler than normal.

Edwards is lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research that outlines how she and her collaborators, using an alternative method called quantitative wood analysis, painted a different picture of Alaskan climate that year.

What happened to climate half a world away from the eruption reflects a combination of forces -- what the volcano did and natural variability in climate. To understand how volcanoes affect the climate system, the team looked closely at the structure of tree rings to reveal what happened on a finer time scale.

Edwards cut a very thin slice of tree ring and dyed it. Using computer software, she calculated the thickness of each of the stained cells. In warm years, the walls of these cells are thickened, and the wood appears darker. In cold years, however, the cell walls are thin, and the wood appears light and less dense.

""That suggests a sudden cooling at the end of the growing season, which is a different result than what you'd get by just looking at annual tree-ring width or wood density,"" said paper co-author Kevin Anchukaitis. ""Using this fine-scale analysis, this week-to-week perspective from individual cells, it is possible to explain the previous observation that the entire summer of 1783 was cold in Alaska, and get a better perspective on a truly extreme climate event.""

Residents living in Mount Etna's shadow have been forced to sweep up volcanic rubble after a fresh eruption covered their town with debris.

Etna's activity intensified earlier today as it spewed lava at 300 metres high with a subsequent rain of volcanic ash falling on nearby villages including Giarre, Fornazzo and Catania in Sicily, Italy.

For more than a week, Etna has been belching lava, ash and volcanic rocks on a regular basis with nearby Catania Airport closed temporarily.

Residents in nearby villages have now been left to clear up the debris in the aftermath which has continually covered streets, cars and houses.

At a towering 3,329m, it is the tallest active volcano in Europe and Italy's highest peak south of the Alps.

Previous eruptions have led to injuries, including in 2017 were 10 people, including a BBC news crew, were wounded.

Scientists have raised concerns that Etna is slowly slipping into the Mediterranean Sea by as much as 14mm each year.

This could result in part of the volcano collapsing into the water, risking debris entering the surrounding ocean and potentially devastating waves.

The 700,000-year-old volcano is also the second most active on Earth, after Hawaii's Mount Kilauea.

Situated between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, it generates nearly constant eruptions of varying degrees.

Each year it produces more than tens of million tons of lava and over 7 million tons of carbon dioxide, water and sulfur dioxide.

But surveys carried out 20 years after the eruption show that the landscape is regenerating and is dominated by a possibly endemic rodent species, Apomys sacobianus.

Biologists know Ap. sacobianus from a single specimen collected in 1956; previous studies conducted by the team show it may be specific only to Mount Pinatubo.

The rodent species is a “disturbance specialist,” meaning that unlike other Apomys species that thrive on mountaintops, Ap. sacobianus has adapted to living in the lowlands due to eruptions in the past.

MANILA — The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 spewed enough volcanic ash into the atmosphere to cool the world. In the immediate vicinity of the volcano, a slurry of ash, mud and volcanic debris blanketed 18,000 hectares (44,500 acres) of forest land, triggering fears among biologists that it could have doomed species left undiscovered and unstudied by science.

To hear this article read aloud, listen here:

With limited surveys conducted on the active volcano before the eruption, researchers were particularly interested in how it impacted species, particularly Apomys sacobianus, a mouse species first observed by scientists in 1956 but not seen by them since.

When biologists returned to Mount Pinatubo two decades after the eruption, in 2011 and 2012, what they found surprised them: the landscape had begun to regenerate, and the tiny mouse was the dominant rodent species on the slopes.

Eric Rickart, curator of vertebrate zoology at the National History Museum of Utah and lead author of the new paper detailing the findings, tells Mongabay that the rodent’s presence contradicts conventional wisdom about the fragility of endemic species after a cataclysmic event.

“For many years, we’ve been interested in how Philippine mammals respond to habitat disturbance — both natural and that caused by humans,” Rickart says. “Most conservation biologists think that endemic species, especially those found on tropical oceanic islands, are the most highly threatened species and are least tolerant of disturbance and competition from non-native invasive species. Clearly, Apomys sacobianus doesn’t fit this description.”

In the study, published last September in the special biodiversity edition of the Philippine Journal of Science, Rickart and his team detailed the species that survived the infamous volcanic blast: eight bat species, five native rodents and two native large mammals. The study notes the unique case of Ap. sacobianus, an extreme example of a “disturbance specialist” or one that quickly adapts to natural events.

From 2011 to 2012, the group surveyed five localities covered in the Pinatubo eruption to study how species adapted to the eruption. This “resilience” among rodents, researchers say, is “instrumental in regenerating soil and promoting early revegetation.” Similarly, understanding the natural way the environment recovers from a natural disturbance could also help conservation biologists and forest managers identify ways to reclaim deforested areas.

Before apex predators like raptors dominate a jungle, it’s the rodent species that sneak into landscapes struck by severe disturbances, Rickart says, adding that it’s common for exotic or non-native species to colonize the area and become the dominant species there.

Previous studies showed that non-native plants thrived in the Pinatubo area 15 years after the eruption, leading the team to “expect that non-native pest rats would be most abundant, along with a few hardy native species,” Rickart says. “Only native species present are widespread generalists that can tolerate disturbance.”

But in surveying Pinatubo’s weedy landscape, the researchers found that Ap. sacobianus rules the mountain. The sturdy mouse may have pushed back pest rodent species and restricted them to the upland farms of the Indigenous Aetas people, the study says. “Native small mammals are resilient, moving into areas of regenerating habitat and ultimately displacing non-native species as vegetation matures,” it says.

The study builds upon surveys conducted by Filipino biologist Danny Balete, field survey leader for the Field Museum in Chicago, who died in 2017. The survey used standardized techniques developed for Philippine small mammals. The group spent a total of 4,507 nights laying traps garnished with coconut or earthworms as bait for rodents and used mist nets for bats.

The team noted that it’s possible that some species have moved to different portions of the mountain; they used the same techniques to record the presence of two rodent species, Ap. zambalensis and Bullimus luzonicus, in localities where they were not recorded before.

While there are scattered patches of mammalian studies on Pinatubo, the researchers estimate that several species may have been lost due to the eruption. Pinatubo’s upper slopes were covered with old-growth forests and would have hosted at least six to eight species before the eruption blew its top off.

As is the case with other mountains, it’s possible too that the peak of Pinatubo has at least one endemic species — and it may be Ap. sacobianus, researchers speculate, since the genus is known to thrive on mountaintops. But unlike other Apomys species, Ap. sacobianus might have adapted to the lowlands due to Pinatubo’s long history of explosive eruptions.

“The evidence is very clear that Apomys sacobianus is thriving on Pinatubo and we believe it is adapted to living in disturbed environments — a legacy of having evolved in a place that was regularly disturbed by volcanic eruptions, some of which were much more powerful than the 1991 event,” Rickart says.

While there’s no immediate threat to the species, besides maybe a bigger eruption, researchers say it will probably rule the Pinatubo landscape until the forest regenerates and other native species return.

“If Apomys sacobianus is indeed a ‘disturbance specialist’ as we think it is, it may become less common as forest develops and species that have a greater requirement for forested habitat increase,” Rickart says.

But it’s still possible to see the species in areas with low levels of disturbance, researchers say, as the mouse is living proof that while big species dominate, it’s the small ones that endure.

Streams of red lava could be seen flowing out of a fissure in the ground in Geldingadalur, close to Mount Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland, in footage filmed by a coast guard helicopter.

While Iceland's Keflavik International Airport and the small fishing port of Grindavik are just a few kilometres away, the area is uninhabited and the eruption was not expected to present any danger.

""The eruption began at Fagradalsfjall in Geldingadalur at about 2045 GMT tonight. The eruption is considered a small one and the eruption fissure is about 500-700 metres (1640-2300 feet) long. The lava is less than 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles) in size,"" the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO), which monitors seismic activity, said in a statement.

The eruption site is in a valley, about 4.7 kilometres inland from the southern coast of the peninsula.

Police and coast guard officials raced to the scene, but the public has been advised to stay away and the main road from the capital region to Keflavik airport was temporarily closed on Friday.

Dormant for 900 years

There were no reports of ash fall, although tephra -- solidified magma rock fragments -- and gas emissions were to be expected.

Police ordered residents living east of the volcano to close their windows and stay indoors due to the risk of possible gas pollution carried by the wind.

Gas emissions -- especially sulphur dioxide -- can be elevated in the immediate vicinity of a volcanic eruption, and may pose a danger to health and even be fatal.

Pollution can exceed acceptable limits, even far away, depending on the winds.

Friday's eruption took place in the Krysuvik volcanic system, which does not have a central volcano.

Eruptions in the region are known as effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily out of the ground, as opposed to explosive ones which spew ash clouds high into the sky.

The Krysuvik system has been inactive for the past 900 years, according to the IMO, while the last eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula dates back almost 800 years, to 1240.

But the region has been under increased surveillance for several weeks after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake was registered on February 24 near Mount Keilir on the outskirts of Reykjavik.

That quake has been followed by an unusual number of smaller tremors -- more than 50,000, the highest number since digital recordings began in 1991.

The seismic activity has moved several kilometres southwest since the quake, concentrating around Mount Fagradalsfjall, where magma was detected just one kilometre under the Earth's surface in recent days.

Seismic activity had however slowed in the past few days.

Land of fire and ice

Iceland has 32 volcanic systems currently considered active, the highest number in Europe. The country has had an eruption every five years on average.

The vast island near the Arctic Circle straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a crack on the ocean floor separating the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.

The shifting of these plates is in part responsible for Iceland's intense volcanic activity.

The most recent eruption was at Holuhraun, beginning in August 2014 and ending in February 2015, in the Bardarbunga volcanic system in an uninhabited area in the centre of the island.

That eruption did not cause any major disruptions outside the immediate vicinity.

But in 2010, an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week with the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights worldwide, which left some 10 million passengers stranded.

“The fissure is estimated to be about 200 metres (219 yards) long,” the IMO said.

“I can see the glowing red sky from my window,” said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, a resident in the town of Grindavik, only 8 km (5 miles) from the eruption.

“Everyone here is getting into their cars to drive up there,” she said.

More than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred in the area in the past four weeks, a huge jump from the 1,000-3,000 earthquakes registered each year since 2014.

“The first notification was received by the Meteorological Office at 2140 GMT. The eruption was confirmed through webcams and satellite images,” the institute said on its website.

While Iceland’s Keflavik international airport, the country’s largest, and the small fishing port of Grindavik are only a few kilometres away, the area is uninhabited and the eruption is not expected to present any danger.

Volcanic eruptions in the region are known as effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily out of the ground, as opposed to explosive ones such as that of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 which spewed ash clouds high into the sky and paralysed air traffic in Europe for weeks. However, all flights in and out of the airport have been halted.

The Krysuvik volcanic system has been inactive for the past 900 years, according to the meteorological office, while the last eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula dates back almost 800 years to 1240.

But the region has been under increased surveillance for several weeks after an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 was registered on 24 February on the outskirts of Reykjavik, followed by an unusual number of smaller tremors – more than 50,000, the highest number since digital recordings began in 1991.

Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, among the largest on the planet, Iceland is a seismic and volcanic hotspot as the two plates move in opposite directions.

The source of the eruption is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, which has pushed its way to the surface over the past weeks, instigating the earthquakes.

The number of quakes had slowed down in recent days, however, leading geologists to say that an eruption would be less likely.

A helicopter with scientific personnel aboard had been scrambled to observe the eruption, IMO said.

A volcanic eruption in Iceland has transformed a tranquil green valley into an ominous-looking scene, its first dark secrets beginning to emerge as volcanologists suggest the eruption could last longer than previously thought.

Experts had initially predicted that the eruption of the fissure near Mount Fagradalsfjall, just 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital Reykjavik, would be brief, likely dying out after a few days.

But due to the constancy of the lava flow and based on the first analyses of the magma, they now suspect the eruption could be a long-hauler.

""The eruption rate has been similar since the beginning of the eruption"" on March 19, Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist at the Institute of Earth Sciences, told AFP.

""We have started to wonder if it may eventually be a long duration eruption.""

The relatively controlled lava flow has since the weekend drawn hordes of curious onlookers to the Geldingadalur valley, eager to catch a rare, first-hand glimpse of the hypnotic display of bubbling orange-red molten rock.

Grilled sausages and marshmallows

The authorities block access only sporadically in case of bad weather or high levels of toxic gas emissions.

According to preliminary calculations, the magma emerging from the volcano is almost 1,190 degrees Celsius (2,170 degrees Farenheit).

Authorities sporadically block access in case of bad weather or high levels of toxic gas emissions

Daredevil spectators who hike 90 minutes from the nearest road have grilled sausages, bacon and marshmallows on the hot lava as it cools to basalt rock.

A scientific study of the freshly-minted basalt suggests that the magma has come from deep within the Earth's mantle, around 15 kilometres (nine miles) beneath the surface.

Magma from a source this deep has not been seen in this region for thousands of years, Sigmundsson said.

""Most magmas make their way to the crust by creating their own lineals, by evolving. This magma is coming straight up,"" explained volcanologist Thorvaldur Thordarson.

And more importantly, the underground lava flow is similar to the one being seen above ground, suggesting the eruption could be protracted, he said.

""In a system where the inflow is the same as the outflow, you can keep that (going) for a long time.""

""In my view, this eruption has potential to sustain itself for quite a long time,"" he said.

Experts say the volcano's location in a an uninhabited natural basin means a lengthy eruption poses no significant danger

Because of the location of the eruption—a natural basin in an uninhabited area—experts said a lengthy eruption poses no significant danger to surrounding areas.

Flowing at its current rate, it would take weeks for the lava to reach the closest road, they said.

Eye on toxic emissions

While Iceland has more active volcanoes than any other country in Europe, the Reykjanes peninsula has not experienced an eruption since the 13th century.

The last one lasted about 30 years, from 1210 to 1240.

A reawakening of the sector could signal the beginning of a new period ""which may last centuries with eruptions, possibly 10 years to 100 years apart,"" according to University of Iceland geophysicist Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson.

The region is already popular with tourists for its famed Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.

The first signs of renewed seismic activity in the region appeared a little more than a year ago, before intensifying about a month ago—an indication that the magma was nearing the surface.

Preliminary calculations put the temperature of the magma emerging from the volcano at almost 1,190 degrees Celsius (2,170 Fahrenheit)

The eruption, located about a dozen kilometres from the closest town, the Grindavik fishing port, has grown more spectacular by the day.

The magma spewing out of a crack in the ground has formed small hills over the past week as it cools, creating two vents ejecting the lava, the biggest one measuring 20 metres.

The site is relatively safe for visitors, although the authorities are keeping a close eye on toxic emissions.

According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, sulphur dioxide levels—which can pose a danger to health and even be fatal—can at times exceed 9,000 microgrammes per cubic metre at the scene, or 450 times the World Health Organization's recommended 24-hour average exposure limit.

A volcanic eruption near Iceland’s capital city of Reykjavik is attracting a lot of attention. The volcano is located only 40 km away from the city, and has been lying dormant over a long period of time. Geologists suspected volcanic activity in the region after more than 50000 earthquakes occurred here over the last 15 months. The eruption caused the sky to turn red as 300000 cubic meters of lava was seen pouring out of the ground during the eruption. It measured upto 1640 to 2460 ft wide.Iceland, known for its active volcanoes, currently has about 32 active volcanic systems in the country. The latest volcanic eruption was caused by the shifting of the plates in the region. The volcano can be reached by taking a 90-minute hike, and people have been trying to reach the area in order to see this natural phenomenon. However, they have been advised not to get too close to the lava for obvious reasons. The lava was luckily confined to the valley, and the eruption did not pose any threat to the population.The volcano erupted after 900 years of remaining inactive. One of the greatest dangers during such an eruption is the release of sulphur dioxide that can be harmful, and sometimes fatal. Rescue operations were underway after a lot of people found it hard to find their way back into the city."

The Geldingadalur eruption therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term volcanic activity of southwest Iceland.
A new eruption seemed extremely likely—but no lava followed, and the acoustic signals vanished, says Thorbjörg Ágústsdóttir, a seismologist at Iceland GeoSurvey.
“A small eruption still releases some pressure,” Ágústsdóttir says.
“The amount of seismic energy release for this small eruption is disproportionately high,” McGarvie says.","scientists, weeks, lava, start, mark, eruption, peninsula, decades, activity, region, seismic, volcanic, magma, small, iceland",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"After being shaken by 15 months of increasingly disruptive earthquakes, including about 50,000 in the past three weeks, Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula is finally experiencing the volcanic eruption that many geologists suspected was on its way. After nearly 800 years without an eruption, this southwestern strip of the country is experiencing lava flows that experts say have been a long time coming.

On Friday, March 19, at around 8:45 p.m. local time, molten rock breached the surface in a valley near a flat-topped mountain named Fagradalsfjall, in the region of Geldingadalur, six miles from the nearest town. Incandescent spatter erupted along a crack in the earth, scorching the soil as small lava fountains illuminated the dark landscape.

The eruption involves a relatively small amount of lava confined to a series of valleys, making it unlikely that any population centers will be threatened. This type of molten rock is very fluid and trapped gasses easily escape, and it’s not erupting into water or ice, so it won’t become especially explosive, generate a sustained ash plume, or fling any sizable volcanic blocks across the region. Scientists believe the eruption will persist for a few more days or weeks before fizzling out.

But this modest eruption could mark the beginning of something bigger. Evidence from both historical accounts and ancient lava flows shows that whenever this region has experienced a major uptick in seismic activity, intermittent eruptions followed for around 100 years.

“The signs are that it’s reawakening,” says Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University.

The Geldingadalur eruption therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term volcanic activity of southwest Iceland. Scientists are scrambling to monitor what may be the opening salvo in a series of volcanic volleys, which could provide clues about why the peninsula flares up just once every eight centuries.

The case of the missing magma

Sitting on a landward portion of the continuously spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Reykjanes Peninsula, about 17 miles southwest of the capital city Reykjavík, is no stranger to earthquakes. But since late 2019, temblors have become more frequent and more energetic. Icelanders on the peninsula, particularly those in the coastal town of Grindavík, have had trouble sleeping lately due to the constant shaking.

This heightened seismic activity is thought to represent a transition from a gradual opening of the rift to a considerably more dramatic phase when both sides of the peninsula are rapidly pulled apart. When a geologic rift quickly pulls the land apart like this, it creates an empty space, and magma rushes up to fill it in.

On March 3, acoustic signals associated with the injection of magma into the shallow crust emanated from between the mountain Fagradalsfjall and a series of fissures that erupted long ago. A new eruption seemed extremely likely—but no lava followed, and the acoustic signals vanished, says Thorbjörg Ágústsdóttir, a seismologist at Iceland GeoSurvey.

Instead, the sheet of magma, known as a dyke, wandered about underground for the next few weeks. Seismic activity and the changing shape of the ground allowed scientists to roughly track its movements. They caught it oscillating between the northeast and southwest of the peninsula, causing cracks to appear in the earth above as it went.

“I called it the dithering dyke because it didn’t seem to know what to do,” McGarvie says. It appeared to be searching, to no avail, for a place it could breach the surface.

4:43

Over the past few weeks, the seismic activity in the region declined, and most dykes cool and solidify before getting a chance to erupt. This led some scientists to suspect an eruption would not occur after all.

Iceland’s uppermost crust is peculiar, however, acting somewhat elastically—meaning it’s a little closer to toffee than hard candy. The crust in this area can stretch a little to make room for magma, allowing the dyke to infiltrate the rock just below the surface without causing violent fractures and producing those telltale acoustic signals.

This stealth mode is typical for eruptions that happen along fissures, such as those along the peninsula. Scientists in Iceland had “just been in the field, and all of a sudden, the ground is opening,” Ágústsdóttir says. Apparently the waning seismic activity in this region, instead of being a sign of calmer days to come, could in fact be a precursor to an eruption.

A long-awaited eruption

On March 19, the Icelandic Meteorological Office picked up a few low-frequency earthquakes that may have come from magma moving toward the surface—but these were very subtle events, Ágústsdóttir says. With no way to know when and where an eruption would happen, local authorities continued to tell people to stay away from the fissure-riddled area.

That evening, lava began erupting close to Fagradalsfjall, inside Geldingadalur, a natural depression whose name means Eunuch Valley—possibly a reference to early settlers’ practice of castrating animals in the region. After failing to find an escape hatch to the northeast or southwest, the dyke apparently “broke through in the middle, because both directions were kind of jammed,” says Tobias Dürig, a volcanologist at the University of Iceland.

A webcam on a nearby ridge first caught sight of the lava. A Coast Guard helicopter was dispatched to the site, and the pilot quickly spotted the embers of lava spitting and hissing at the sky.

Lava first poured out of a meandering fissure 1,650 feet long, but over the weekend, the eruption focused its output on single spot, building a steep, towering cauldron of freshly cooled rock. Smooth rivers of lava crept around blockier, rubble-like lava. Lava flowing at a steady pace caused the cone to suffer a few partial collapses as it flung blobs of lava across the scorched earth.

The dyke of magma is small, just over four miles long, and the eruption is confined to a valley that is surrounded by more valleys, preventing lava from escaping the area and threatening any population centers. Sulfur dioxide, a common volcanic gas, is being emitted by the eruption, however, and even small quantities can irritate the lungs of those with respiratory conditions such as asthma. But so far, the wind is blowing the volcanic gas away from populated areas.

Scientists say one possible concern is that a new fissure could suddenly and unexpectedly open up near the current one, ambushing anyone in the area. “That could easily happen, and that could happen fast, and it would not be a good place to be,” Dürig says.

Studying the inferno

Overall, however, scientists believe this will be a largely unhazardous eruption. Thanks to easy access to the area, researchers are throwing their entire toolbox at the eruption, seeing it as the best chance they have ever had to understand the unusual tectonics and volcanism of the region.

Some have scooped up lava and rushed it to a lab, hoping to unravel the specific chemistry of the material. Dürig has flown back and forth over the eruption, using radar to determine how thick the lava flows are and estimate how much lava is erupting.

Evgenia Ilyinskaya, a volcanologist at the University of Leeds, went up to the eruption this weekend wearing a backpack full of instruments that analyzed the compounds gushing out of the fissure.

“It’s a very special thing to get close to an eruption site,” Ilyinskaya says. During the eruption’s beginning, she was greeted with a cacophony of booms and whooshes under her feet. “It shakes you to your core,” she says. “This is something that’s really, really powerful. You feel very small and very insignificant.”

Against official advice, thousands of people living in the peninsula have gathered around the eruption site, treating the ridges as an amphitheater. One group lingered for too long, then got lost looking for their cars in the dark. Someone was also caught trying to fry eggs and bacon atop the lava, predictably with little success.

While volcanologists are taking the opportunity to study this eruption, archaeologists are scrambling to figure out if the lava threatens any significant sites. Based on historical records, experts believe a burial site thought to date back more than 1,000 years, perhaps belonging to a notable figure, could be right in the path of the eruption. According to local news reports, archaeologist Oddgeir Isaksen of the Cultural Heritage Agency of Iceland sped to the scene in a helicopter shortly after the eruption began, but he was not able to find evidence of the burial site before lava overran the area.

A century of activity?

The eruption is probably going to peter out in the coming days or weeks, and the bigger earthquakes keeping people awake may also drop off for a bit. “A small eruption still releases some pressure,” Ágústsdóttir says.

But there are hints that the fireworks are far from over. “The amount of seismic energy release for this small eruption is disproportionately high,” McGarvie says. There could have been a significant amount of tectonic shifting across the peninsula, meaning additional pockets of magma could make their way to the surface.

Based on the geological history of the region and studies of somewhat similar eruptions elsewhere in Iceland, another eruption from a different fissure in Reykjanes Peninsula is a distinct possibility, Ilyinskaya says. But this could transpire in days, weeks, months, or even years. It may involve a similar amount of magma as the current eruption, or it could release significantly more.

The possibility of future eruptions is underscored by the fact that the type of seismic shaking leading up to last week’s eruption has happened before—three times before, in fact, in the past few thousand years. Historical accounts and layers of ancient volcanic rock suggest that each time this area experiences a significant increase in earthquakes, it culminates in several decades of eruptions, jumping from fissure to fissure all over the peninsula.

The small and relatively safe eruption occurring now therefore provides a stellar opportunity for scientists and emergency managers to prepare for possible bursts of lava to come. “If this is the start,” Ágústsdóttir says, “this is good training.”"

There was no immediate danger, he said, although people should avoid travelling to the area on the Reykjanes peninsula.
Thousands of tremors measuring up to 5 on the Richter scale have been recorded on the peninsula during the past week.
Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist, said that if it came, the eruption could also be delayed by several days.","signs, imminent, scientists, told, freysteinn, lava, eruption, say, air, activity, unlikely, strong, area, seismic, volcanic, iceland",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Scientists in Iceland have said there are now “strong signs” that a volcanic eruption may be under way following several days of near-constant seismic activity near Mount Keilir about 20 miles south of the capital, Reykjavik.

“We are not saying we have signs an eruption has begun,” Kristín Jónsdóttir of the Icelandic meteorological office told local media on Wednesday. “But this looks like the type of activity we expect in the run-up to an eruption.”

Víðir Reynisson of the island’s civil defence force told a mid-afternoon news conference it was “more likely than not” that an eruption – the first in the area since the 12th century – was about to begin, and could happen within the next few hours.

But Víðir said there was “no disaster going on and everyone can get on with their daily lives”. There was no immediate danger, he said, although people should avoid travelling to the area on the Reykjanes peninsula.

Thousands of tremors measuring up to 5 on the Richter scale have been recorded on the peninsula during the past week. Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist, said that if it came, the eruption could also be delayed by several days.

If magma reaches the surface, Freysteinn said, it is unlikely to be in the form of an explosion of lava and ash shooting into the sky, but rather what is known as a fissure eruption, in which lava emerges more slowly from a crack in the earth’s surface.

That means there is unlikely to be a repeat of the chaos in 2010 when the six-day explosive eruption of the more southerly Eyjafjallajökull volcano caused huge disruption to international air travel, affecting as many as 10 million travellers.

“This event is completely different to Eyjafjallajökull,” Freysteinn said. “It is very unlikely that it will disrupt air transport,” he said. “This will probably be a lava eruption with little explosive activity.”

Any lava flows near Mount Keilir are unlikely to reach populated areas, experts have said, but could interrupt air traffic to and from Keflavík international airport, which is about 12 miles from the main area of seismic activity and is on orange alert.

There is also a chance that road access to the airport could be cut off by lava flows, prompting authorities to draw up contingency plans to divert flights and passengers to the island’s other airports."

This study will help refine how volcanic ash is represented in forecasting models used by the VAACs, which must react in real-time to provide useful advice during a volcanic eruption.

Eduardo Rossi, a researcher at the Department of Earth Sciences of the UNIGE Faculty of Sciences and the first author of the study, said, “During an explosive volcanic eruption, fragments ranging from a few microns to more than 2 meters are ejected from the volcanic vent. The larger the particles, the faster and closer the volcano they fall, reducing ash’s concentration in the atmosphere. This is why the new strategies have integrated concentration thresholds better defining the dangerousness for aircraft engines. From 2 milligrams per cubic meter, airlines must have an approved safety case to operate.”

Costanza Bonadonna, a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at UNIGE, said, “Despite existing knowledge about the ash clouds, several open questions remained unanswered after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, including the discovery of particles in the UK that were much larger than expected. We wanted to understand how this was possible by accurately analyzing the ash particles from the Sakurajima volcano in Japan, which has been erupting 2-3 times a day for more than 50 years.”

Scientists collected the ash before it hit the ground using an adhesive paper to observe how micrometric particles would group into clusters, which were destroyed after the impact with the ground.

Eduardo Rossi said, “It plays an important role in the sedimentation rate. Once assembled in aggregates, these micrometer particles fall much faster and closer to the volcano than the models predict because they are ultimately heavier than if they fell individually. This is called premature sedimentation.”

In Japan, the UNIGE team made a new important discovery: the observation of the rafting effect. Using a high-speed camera, the volcanologists observed the ash’s sedimentation in real-time and discovered previously unseen aggregates called cored clusters.

Costanza Bonadonna said, “These are formed by a large particle of 100-800 microns – the core – which is covered by many small particles less than 60 microns. And this external layer of small particles can act as a parachute over the core, delaying its sedimentation. This is the rafting effect.”

Eduardo Rossi said, “Working with Frances Beckett of the UK Met Office, we have carried out several simulations that have enabled us to answer the questions raised by the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull and the unexplained discovery of these oversized ash particles in the UK. It was the result of this rafting effect, which delayed the fall of these aggregates.”

The event, which triggered the eruption, was captured in rare detail by an international team of scientists, who said it offers new insights into one of the world's most active volcanoes.

""The power of this study is that it's one of the first times we've been able to see a full eruptive cycle in this detail at almost any volcano,"" said Peter La Femina, associate professor of geosciences at Penn State. ""We've monitored Sierra Negra from when it last erupted in 2005 through the 2018 eruption and beyond, and we have this beautiful record that's a rarity in itself.""

For nearly two months in 2018, lava erupted from the volcano, covering about 19 square miles of Isabela Island, the largest island in the Galápagos and home to about 2,000 people and endangered animal species like the Galápagos giant tortoise.

""The 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra was a really spectacular volcanic event, occurring in the 'living laboratory' of the Galápagos Islands,"" said Andrew Bell, a volcanologist at the University of Edinburgh. ""Great teamwork, and a bit of luck, allowed us to capture this unique dataset that provide us with important new understanding as to how these volcanoes behave, and how we might be able to better forecast future eruptions.""

While Sierra Negra is among the world's most active volcanos, its remote location previously made monitoring difficult. Scientists now use networks of ground-based seismic and GPS monitoring stations and satellite observations to observe the volcano.

""Based on constant monitoring of activity of Galapagos volcanoes, we detected a dramatic increase of seismicity and a steady uplift of crater floor at Sierra Negra,"" said Mario Ruiz, director of the Ecuador Geophysical Institute, the country's national monitoring agency. ""Soon we contacted colleagues from the United Kingdom, United States and Ireland and proposed them to work together to investigate the mechanisms leading to an impending eruption of this volcano. This research is an example of international collaboration and partnership.""

The scientists captured data over 13 years as the volcano's magma chamber gradually refilled following the 2005 eruption, stressing the surrounding crust and creating earthquakes. This continued until June 2018, when an earthquake occurred on the calderas fault system and triggered the subsequent eruption, the scientists said.

""We have this story of magma coming in and stressing the system to the point of failure and the whole system draining again through the eruption of lava flows,"" La Femina said. ""This is the first time anyone's seen that in the Galápagos to this detail. This is the first time we've had the data to say, 'okay, this is what happened here.'""

Often during volcanic eruptions, as magma chambers empty the ground above them sinks and forms a bowl-like depression, or a caldera. But Sierra Negra experienced a caldera resurgence, leaving this area higher in elevation than it was before the eruption, the scientists said.

Inside the Sierra Negra caldera is a ""trap-door fault,"" which is hinged at one end while the other can be uplifted by rising magma. The scientists found the fault caused hills inside of the six-mile-wide caldera to lift vertically by more than 6 feet during the earthquake that triggered the eruption.

Caldera resurgence, important to better understanding eruptions, had not been previously observed in such detail, the scientists reported in the journal Nature Communications.

""Resurgence is typical of explosive calderas at volcanoes like Yellowstone, not the kind of shield volcanoes we see in the Galápagos or Hawaii,"" La Femina said. ""This gives us the ability to look at other volcanoes in the Galápagos and say, 'well that's what could have happened to form that caldera or that resurgent ridge.'""

The scientists said the findings could help their counterparts in Ecuador better track unrest and warn of future eruptions.

""There are people who live on Isabella Island, so studying and understanding how these eruptions occur is important to manage the hazards and risks to local populations,"" La Femina said.

No evacuation orders have been issued, and there has been no reported flight disruption.

But locals are taking no chances.

""The residents are scared, many are staying indoors to avoid the thick volcanic ash,"" Roy Bangun, 41, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Muhammad Nurul Asrori, a monitoring officer at Sinabung, said Tuesday's plume of smoke and ash was the largest he had seen since 2010, and warned that it could still get bigger.

""The large lava dome at any time could burst, causing a bigger avalanche of hot clouds,"" he said.

Sinabung, a 2,460-meter volcano, was dormant for centuries before roaring back to life in 2010 when an eruption killed two people.

After another period of inactivity, it erupted again in 2013 and has remained highly active since.

In 2014, an eruption killed at least 16 people, while seven died in a 2016 blast.

Indonesia – an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and islets – has nearly 130 active volcanoes.

It sits on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of tectonic plate boundaries circling the Pacific Ocean where frequent seismic activity occurs.

Mt. Merapi on Java island, one of the world's most active volcanoes, also erupted this week, spewing lava down one of its flanks."

Woźniak

Ancient Egyptians abandoned one of their coastal cities more than 2000 years ago, when the supply of fresh water dried up. The cause may have been a major volcanic eruption, possibly on the other side of the world, that triggered a severe drought.

Archaeologists have been excavating the city of Berenike on Egypt’s Red Sea coast on and off since 1994. Berenike was founded between 275 and 260 BC, but was temporarily abandoned sometime between 220 and 200 BC, before being repopulated for many centuries. After Egypt was annexed by the Roman Empire in 30 BC, Berenike became the empire’s southernmost port.

Berenike was “a kind of combination of city and military base”, says Marek Woźniak at the Institute of Mediterranean and Oriental Cultures in Warsaw, Poland.

Since 2014, Woźniak has been excavating the remains of a gate and tower in the fortress wall. With James Harrell at the University of Toledo in Ohio, he has now described a well sunk into the floor of the building. The well still accumulates water today. “It tastes pretty good, although actually a bit salty,” says Woźniak.

However, the well dried up between 220 and 200 BC, and sand was blown into it by the wind. This sand is preserved in the well, and contains two bronze coins dating from the decades before 199 BC. Elsewhere in the fortress, there are few artefacts from that time, suggesting Berenike was abandoned.

There must have been a drought lasting several years to cause the well to dry up, says Woźniak. He says the most likely cause is a volcanic eruption. In line with this, a 2017 study led by Jennifer Marlon at Yale University found that, in 209 BC, a volcanic eruption released lots of sulphate aerosols into Earth’s atmosphere. This caused the summer rains over the Nile headwaters to fail. The lack of rain could explain the well drying out, which perhaps helped encourage inhabitants to abandon the city.

It is unclear which volcano would have been responsible. Woźniak and Harrell suggest four possibilities: Popocatéptl in Mexico, Pelée on the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles, Tsurumi or Hakusan, both of which are in Japan.

– Red Cross making volcano cat bond progress.","catastrophe, volcano, issued, using, bond, danish, cat, ils, eruption, cross, red, volcanic, risk",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"The very first catastrophe bond covering pure volcanic eruption risk has now been completed, with a $3 million privately placed issuance brought to market by Replexus and Howden Capital Markets and backed by leading cat bond investors for the Danish Red Cross.



The catastrophe bond covers the risk of eruption of 10 volcanoes across three continents and we’re told raised $3 million from specialist cat bond investors, with the capital set to be used to support aid in the aftermath of an eruption by sponsor the Danish Red Cross.

Initial investors in the volcano cat bond included insurance-linked securities (ILS) specialist managers Plenum Investments, Schroder Investment Management and Solidum Partners.

Issued using Replexus’ Guernsey domiciled Dunant Re IC Limited, the volcanic eruption catastrophe bond features a parametric trigger based on plume heights, as anticipated.

The volcano cat bond from the Red Cross has been a long time in the making, having first come to light in late 2018.

We understand the deal nearly got done a year ago, but funding challenges and then the global pandemic postponed this innovative issuance until now.

Replexus Group, an insurance-linked securities (ILS) risk securitisation facilitator and risk transfer consultancy set up by Cedric Edmonds, has been instrumental in getting the Danish Red Cross’ first cat bond to market.

We must also highlight the tireless work of Adam Bornstein, part of the Global Innovative Finance Team of the Red Cross, who had the initial vision that the capital markets could augment the DRC’s disaster relief financing and explored the catastrophe bond as a possible structure to use.

Replexus issued the volcanic cat bond notes through its Dunant Re reinsurance structure and settled them using its unique blockchain based ILS platform, the ILSBlockchain.

Meanwhile, modelling of the volcanic risk was undertaken by Mitiga Solutions, a specialist in modelling some of the less typical risks we see in ILS.

Howden Capital Markets, the recently established unit of the Howden Group, was also key to getting the volcanic risk cat bond completed, with Howden Group Holdings’ charitable Foundation assisting with $150,000 of funding to get the deal over the line and its Reinsurance, Capital Markets and Financial Lines divisions all playing a role in the underlying insurance contract and terms.

Using a parametric trigger that takes into account both the height of the volcanic eruption ash plume and the wind direction, to define where ash would fall and disruption most likely be, the idea is that the catastrophe bond should pay-out quickly for specific scenarios where aid from humanitarian funds would be required.

In this way, the Danish Red Cross is pre-funding part of its humanitarian aid response needs for volcanic risk, using a securitized capital markets instrument. Hence this is both pre-funding and also securing specific disaster risk financing with this deal, an innovative approach and one that could have broader application in aid related works.

Ten volcanoes are covered, selected because they pose the greatest humanitarian risk and the parametric trigger has three plume height thresholds that can be met to define a payout amount.

The ten volcanoes covered by the catastrophe bond all have at least 700,000 individuals living within 60 miles (100km) radius of a potential eruption and include North America’s second highest volcano, Popocatépetl, Mexico, and Colombia’s Nevado del Ruiz, which killed 23,000 and displaced thousands of people when it erupted in 1985.

Other volcanoes covered by the bond include three in Ecuador (Cotopaxi, Tungurahua and Pichincha), two in Indonesia (Merapi and Raung), one in Chile (Villa Rica), one in Guatemala (Fuego), and one in Cameroon (Mt. Cameroon).

That also makes this a particularly international catastrophe bond, focused on specific risks in numerous countries, which is a first for the cat bond market.

International coverage is of course seen widely in cat bond deals, but they cover portfolios of insurance business, not specific geological risk related features such as this.

A payout of the $3 million volcano cat bond would be triggered if a volcanic ash plume reaches a certain height and the prevailing wind directs the resulting ash to fall towards vulnerable communities.

“Mitiga Solutions has developed a state-of-the-art model using numerous data inputs to predict where funds will be needed, improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian relief,” explained Alejandro Marti, CEO and Co-founder of Mitiga Solutions, Barcelona-based experts in predicting natural hazards.

“Our model can anticipate the trajectory of the volcanic ash cloud using prevailing winds to better estimate the impact and more effectively guide CAT bond proceeds.”

Replexus leveraged its private ILS Blockchain to issue and settle the transaction, which it is estimated has reduced the costs by around by $200,000 – $400,000 per issuance, compared to a traditional settlement system.

“The volcano CAT bond will be placed on an insurance-linked securities (ILS) blockchain, making the transaction particularly cost-effective for the aid agency and enabling secondary market trading among ILS investors,” Cedric Edmonds, founder and CEO of Replexus said.

“Additional benefits of the blockchain structure include allowing investors to hold their own securities on their own computer server rather than using a custody bank, and therefore saving five to 10 basis points per annum on the value of the securities they hold,” Edmonds added.

Charlie Langdale, Managing Director of Financial Lines for Howden Broking, also said, “The volcano CAT bond is an important addition to the ILS market as it has the potential to revolutionise disaster relief finance and as such represents a ground-breaking product.

“We are delighted to be able to support this new and innovative solution through our charitable Foundation, which is committed to supporting causes that alleviate sickness, poverty and disasters around the world.”

Dunant Re IC Limited issued the $3 million tranche of Series 2021-1 Class VE principal-at-risk notes, which are callable and due for maturity after three years in 2024.

It’s pleasing to see this volcanic risk cat bond finally issued, as we’re aware of the hard-work some at the Danish Red Cross have undertaken to make this happen.

The Danish Red Cross has now set a new first for innovative disaster risk financing, that utilises third-party investors to pre-fund a predictable source of humanitarian aid capital.

It will be interesting to see whether the organisation looks to replicate the volcano cat bond for other humanitarian risks it responds to.

We understand this volcano cat bond will provide three years of coverage, with maturity due in 2024.

We’ve added this first volcanic risk catastrophe bond, the Dunant Re IC Limited (Series 2021-1) transaction, to our extensive Deal Directory where you can find details of every cat bond issued.

MOUNT SINABUNG, Indonesia--A rumbling volcano on Indonesia’s Sumatra island unleashed an avalanche of searing gas clouds flowing down its slopes during eruption on Thursday. No casualties were reported.

Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province was shooting smoke and ash as high as 1,000 meters into the air and hot ash clouds traveled up to 3 kilometers southeast, Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center said.

There were no casualties from the eruption, said Armen Putra, an official at the Sinabung monitoring post. He said villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers from the crater’s mouth and should be aware of the peril of lava.

The alert is being maintained at the second-highest level while authorities are closely monitoring the volcano after sensors picked up increasing activity in past weeks.

The 2,600-meter mountain has been rumbling since last year. It was sending volcanic materials more than 5,000 meters into the sky and depositing ash on nearby villages when erupted early this month.

Some 30,000 people have been forced to leave homes around Sinabung in the past few years.

Sinabung was dormant for four centuries before exploding in 2010, killing two people. Another eruption in 2014 killed 17 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.

The volcano, one of two currently erupting in Indonesia, has sporadically come to life since then.

Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin."

""We've never seen so much seismic activity,"" Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) told Reuters.
""Everyone here is so tired,"" Gudmundsdottir, a 5th grade school teacher, said.
Authorities in Iceland warned of an imminent volcanic eruption on the peninsula in early March, but said they did not expect it to disturb international air traffic or damage critical infrastructure nearby.","grindavik, told, weeks, gudmundsdottir, eruption, peninsula, beds, sleepless, quaking, earthquakes, seismic, await, volcanic, tired, icelanders",volcanic eruption,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Icelanders are yearning for some undisturbed shut-eye after tremors from tens of thousands of earthquakes have rattled their sleep for weeks in what scientists call an unprecedented seismic event, which might well end in a spectacular volcanic eruption.

""At the moment we're feeling it constantly. It's like you're walking over a fragile suspension bridge,"" Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, a lifelong resident in the town of Grindavik, told Reuters.

Grindavik lies in the southern part of the Reykjanes Peninsula, a volcanic and seismic hot spot, where more than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred since Feb. 24, exceeding the total number of earthquakes registered there last year.

Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, Iceland frequently experiences earthquakes as the plates slowly drift in opposite directions at a pace of around 2 centimetres each year.

The source of the past weeks' earthquakes is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, moving roughly one kilometre (0.6 mile) beneath the peninsula, as it tries to push its way to the surface.

""We've never seen so much seismic activity,"" Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) told Reuters.

Some of those quakes clocked in at magnitudes as high as 5.7.

""Everyone here is so tired,"" Gudmundsdottir, a 5th grade school teacher, said. ""When I go to bed at night, all I think about is: Am I going to get any sleep tonight?"".

Many in Grindavik have visited relatives, spent time in summer houses, or even rented a hotel room in Reykjavik, the capital, just to get a break and a good night's sleep.

Authorities in Iceland warned of an imminent volcanic eruption on the peninsula in early March, but said they did not expect it to disturb international air traffic or damage critical infrastructure nearby.

Unlike the eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes, the eruption on the peninsula is not expected to spew much ash or smoke into the atmosphere.

Experts are expecting lava to erupt from fissures in the ground, possibly resulting in spectacular lava fountains, which could extend 20 to 100 metres in the air.

Already last year authorities put an emergency plan in place for Grindavik. One option includes putting locals on boats in the North Atlantic, if an eruption shuts roads to the remote town.

""I trust the authorities to keep us informed and evacuate us,"" Gudmundsdottir said. ""I'm not scared, just tired."""
