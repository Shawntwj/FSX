Some neighbourhoods were submerged as river levels rose in the capital city, which is home to more than 10 million people.
Jakarta's streets and toll roads were inundated, prompting toll road operators to temporarily shut several toll gates on Saturday.
Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan attributed the flood to the high rainfall of more than 150mm in a day.
The weatherman and the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space had sounded early warnings about heavy rain and potential floods earlier in the week in Greater Jakarta.","rainfall, peaked, national, floods, toll, city, surrounding, areas, rose, nearby, hit, thousands, heavy, evacuated, rain, jakarta"
