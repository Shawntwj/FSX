The number of evacuees have more than doubled from 20,575 people reported on Wednesday morning.

Apart from those evacuated in the east coast states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, and eastern Johor, several dozen people were evacuated from rural areas in Perak and Sabah states, Bernama news agency reported.

Malaysia's flood crisis, which is into its third month, has sent vegetable prices soaring, with delivery to Singapore affected due to blocked roads.

Federation of Malaysian Vegetable Farmers Association president Lim Ser Kwee said the prices of vegetables have gone up as the bad weather has affected output.

""There has been no sun for one week, and rain for three to four days. So the vegetables can't grow,"" Mr Lim told The Straits Times.

He said the prolonged rainy season had caused a drop in supply by around 30 to 40 per cent.

The price of chye sim has increased from RM3 a kilogramme to RM4, while the price of long beans have risen to RM8 a kilogramme from RM4 last month, he said.

Mr Bernard Teh, manager of Yong Kah vegetable farm in Simpang Renggam, Johor, which exports 60 to 70 per cent of its produce to Singapore, said the delivery of vegetables to the city state was affected as some roads are closed due to the floods.

Non-stop heavy rain over the last 72 hours have also caused his crops to die, with production over the last one to two weeks dropping by more than 50 per cent.

""For some items, there is no output at all. You wouldn't be able to get any even if you had the money,"" he said, citing chye sim and water spinach among some of the vegetables most impacted by the monsoon season.

""The supply issue may even continue until after Chinese New Year,"" he said, explaining that vegetables such as beans and cucumbers require 60 to 80 days to mature, while leafy vegetables will need 20 to 30 days.

Mr Momy Ket Jik, senior sales manager at Ban Choon Marketing Pte Ltd, said the vegetable supply from Malaysia has been affected since last week, causing the company to rely more heavily on its other sources for imports.

At least five deaths have been reported due to the annual monsoon season, which typically starts in November and lasts for about four months.

The latest victim was a 20-year-old man, who fell from a boat on Thursday while helping flood victims to move to a shelter in Kuala Krai, Kelantan.

Pahang, the largest state in Peninsular Malaysia by size, has been the worst hit in the current rainy season, with many of its large rivers swollen with raging rainwater.

There were 27,073 evacuees were housed at 275 temporary relief centres in nine Pahang districts, Bernama reported.

Anih Bhd, concessionaire of East Coast Expressway (ECE) Phase 1 said some sections of the highway were still impassable to vehicles.

The ECE is the main highway linking Terengganu and Pahang states to Kuala Lumpur.

In neighbouring Terengganu state, the flood victims totalled 12,899 people on Friday morning in 50 relief centres, higher than 8,138 evacuees on Thursday afternoon.

North-east Kelantan state has 6,319 people in relief centres on Friday morning in 74 relief centres.

The number of those at relief centres in Johor at 8am on Friday stood at 1,276, fewer than in recent days.

Johor's health and environment committee chairman R. Vidyananthan said they are placed in 14 shelters, while two relief centres have closed due to improved weather conditions, Bernama reported."

A “floodscape” could be seen as a contradiction in terms: Flood spreads wherever gravity leads it, covering the familiar topography with a dark, gray, and uniform blanket. In that regard, flood is amorphous, as it can distort and temporarily erase forms and features from the visible landscape—nothing that could be described as a “scape” in the sense of articulated and meaningful scenery. But when the boundaries of a flood are not just defined by the quantity or the velocity of water but also by landforms and structures carefully designed and placed to influence and shape the “disaster,” the result can be considered as a landscape, physically and culturally defined by flood.

In my forthcoming book, Floodscapes, I explore humanity’s past relationship to flood processes, from ancient and mythical floods to the rise of environmental policies, as well as a selection of contemporary projects. The latter group includes interventions currently implemented upstream in the Swiss canton of Valais, the French Isère Département, the German state of Bavaria, and downstream in the Dutch Groningen province, Lower Rivers region, and Meuse-Rhine Estuary. These six adaptation and mitigation projects show that ancient strategies are a source of inspiration, bridging centuries of technical and territorial transformations that have left our rivers and coastlines heavily dammed and channelized. From the construction of the first artificial mounds in Frisia, the Netherlands, to the “depoldering” of the Overdiepse Polder in Dutch Brabant, more than 2,500 years have passed, while 500 years separate the first déversoir overspill in Blois from the champs d’inondation contrôlée currently built in the Isère Valley.

The revival of these past practices enlarges the range of possible landscape interventions and practices capable of restoring a balanced and dynamic relationship between human habitat and natural fluctuations. Furthermore, motivated by the need to exploit and produce, these practices show that mitigation does not necessarily entail the creation of enclosed and unproductive green buffer zones: on the contrary, millenary experience has shown that flexible and resilient landscapes could also offer productive living environments, provided that they are designed and inhabited in a way that allows natural fluctuations to take place.

More than just an answer to flood risks, these new floodscapes participate in the repositioning of natural processes within the living environment, and there-fore within the field of spatial design. Creating a space that emphasizes fluctuation rather than neutralizing all its effects means a radical breakthrough with regard to coercive flood defense that has turned most European rivers into drainage channels, hiding risks and flood processes behind ever-higher levees. Alternatively, these new “elastic landscapes” reintroduce physicality and positivism into environments that have been literally drained by intensive exploitation and petrified by urbanization. They form instead a permanent display of natural variation, offering all citizens the experience of change, stimulating observation, concern, and anticipation. Witnesses to a flood episode along the Isar, Meuse, Rhône, Rhine, or Isère Rivers can now observe the rivers’ seasonal changes, both affecting and protecting their daily environment and giving meaning and presence to the term “floodplain.” Floodscapes serve as reality checks more efficiently than communication campaigns, dramatized news, or apocalyptic fiction. In this regard, floodscapes not only mitigate the direct effects of the flood but, by making it visible, tangible, and acceptable, they also help foster stronger resilience on the part of individuals, communities, and territories.

Significantly, evacuation exercises are no longer taboo. In the Swiss Rhône Valley, the canton’s capital informs its inhabitants about the closest dry shelter reachable in case of a dam-breach alert. Some Dutch municipalities are developing disaster management strategies, and since 2015, the local Red Cross has become involved in exercises for flood rescue using a network of civilian volunteers. In case of high water, the municipality of Munich has set up a seven-step scheme of action in order to protect the population living along the Isar. Numerous examples show that the adaptation of spaces and minds go together and follow a path closer to citizens’ reactivity and self-organization capacity, but also closer to their desires regarding the accessibility and public use of watercourses.

Like yesterday’s massive dams, today’s floodscapes are the expression of a new cosmogony. This new model sees a logic of negotiated cohabitation with natural processes replace the old narratives of heroic fight, hypothetical conquest, and absolute safety. Navigating between mobilization and a reassuring discourse, official communication and policies today must create space for anticipation, adaptation, and mitigation, rather than celebrate ambition or a pseudo-permanent safety. Rather than combative ardor, cautious care and measured adjustments are required to adapt our coasts and rivers. Technology, in particular hydro-engineering, is no longer perceived as the final remedy against natural threats but rather as one ingredient in the delicate balance that needs to be found, in each specific situation, between natural fluctuations and human needs. From this perspective, floodscapes are a collective achievement: They require a consensus in terms of risk redistribution, and a joint and lasting effort in terms of investment, design, and care. They are also the shared success of supranational, national, and local institutions, which are able to articulate the various scales of reflection and intervention.

The transformation of riverine landscapes is a highly specific enterprise, historically, geographically, and culturally, and it remains dependent on economic and political ups and downs. Yet the pioneering work done in the past 20 years can be studied and compared to reflect on the modus operandi that has led to successful transformations. They allow us to build combinatory and consensual adaptation strategies, and they encourage stakeholders and architects of regional planning to play an active role in this historical enterprise. Judging by the first landscapes transformed since the turn of the millennium, which are now a source of curiosity and pride, all relevant actors in the territories concerned are ready and willing to play an active role in this historical turn. There is every reason to believe that many more floodscapes will emerge in the coming decades, as necessary adaptation measures and as positive and flexible answers to an uncertain future.

Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks.
“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality.
Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents.
For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.","rivers, floods, devastation, coming, kasese, camp, uganda, region, flooding, hospital, help, land, face, residents",floods,Acute climatological event (flood),"KASESE, UGANDA — Around 1 a.m. on May 7, 2020, Lorna Bambu heard screams.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”"

Situation Updates

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts the peak of La Nina to occur in December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina coincides with the peak of rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The agency also states that this phenomenon could increase precipitation which triggers heavy rainfall across the country. During this period, Indonesia frequently suffers flood and landslides. As of January 14, 2021, several provinces in the country had reported floods and landslides since the beginning of the year.

Flooding in Lhokseumawe and Langsa, Aceh province, 4 January 2021

Excessive rainfall since Saturday, 2 January 2021, caused Kareung Pase river to overflow, flooding several areas in Lhokseumawe and Langsa. The flood had caused four sub-districts namely Blang Mangat, Banda Sakti, Muara Dua, and Muara Satu to be inundated with floodwater ranging from 60-70 cm. As a result, hundreds of people from 171 households were temporarily displaced. Flooding also inundated hundreds of houses in the affected areas. In Langsa, flooding inundated four sub-districts namely Langsa Barat, Langsa Lama, Langsa Baro, and Langsa Timur. Approximately 9,448 people who reside in the four sub-districts were affected. The flood has receded, however, several Langsa areas inundated again on 12 January 2021.

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts rain is still going to occur on 13-15 January 2021. The agency also categorizes several districts in the province —Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan,

Rain with medium until high intensity has caused floods since January 12, 2021 in South Kalimantan. The floods has killed 15 people, inundated 24,379 hoises and displaced 39,549 people. Governor of South Kalimantan Sahbirin Noor has increased the status from emergency alert status to emergency response status. The decision was taken after the floods hitting almost parts of South Kalimantan due to high rain intensity for several days.

The death toll reaches 15 people condisting of 7 people in Tanah Laut Regency, 3 people in Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency, 1 in Banjar Baru city, 3 people in Banjar Regency said head of data, information snd communication center BNPB.

The condition of national roads in South Kalimantan connecting regencies and cities have been disconnected due to the floods after the bridge at Mataraman sub district, Banjar Regency has been disconnected since Thursday (14/1/2021).

Human Initiative volunteer team arrived at the location of the South Kalimantan flood disaster on January 16 at 21.00 Central Indonesia Time (WITA), especially in. Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency, which is the regency with the largest affected residents, namely 16,100 families with 64,400 people at that time. Arriving at the location, the team met with BPBD and coordinated on the areas which is difficult to access. The results of the coordination in Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency area, the team was directed to Hantakan District, an area can be accessed in 1 hour drice to the nearest assistance or signal. There, the electricity went out and residents were evacuated to several posts, one of which was the sub-district building. The team together with government representatives headed to Hantakan District and arrived at around 02.00 in the morning. Arriving at the post, the team immediately turned on the generator to be used to add lighting to the evacuation and helped guard the post, because the supply including the generator have been stolen.

Until now, the Human Initiative team has been in Hantakan Village, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency, South Kalimantan. There were 12 villages with 7 affected villages and 2 isolated villages because the bridge has been disconnected. The number of residents is 122,689 people in 12 villages with 6,424 men and 6265 women, with around 1800 affected families. On 17/1/21, it was difficult to get signal and access to electricity. To get fuel and the signal the team had to go down for 1 - 2 hours to Birayang sub district. Hantakan Village, located on the edge of Watershed, was in ruins; public facilities, markets and many houses were destroyed leaving rubble. There was still a roar from the gradually shrinking water flow, while residents were seen cleaning the mud-wrapped furniture in the house. Access to clean water uses existing rivers for public toilets and AMDK for consumption. Meanwhile, the public health facilities, namely community health center (puskesmas) in Hantakan Village, is about 500 meters from the village."

Situation analysis

Description of the disaster

Indonesia has high level of precipitation and is prone to flooding during rainy season. According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, areas prone to flooding in Indonesia are approximately 39,371,167 hectares. These areas are inhabited by approximately 100,814,666 people. Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (Indonesian: Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, abbreviated BMKG) predicted the peak of La Nina would occur across the months of December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina is coinciding with the peak of the rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The simultaneous occurrence of these two events has triggered heavy rainfall across the country. Since December 2020 PMI has responded to around 14 different flooding events across several provinces. The most recent event, which commenced on 15 January 2021, has resulted in flooding and landslides in several districts in South Kalimantan province including in Tapin, Hulu Sungai Tengah, Hulu Sungai Utara, Hulu Sungai Selatan, Tanah Laut, Tabalong, Banjar, Banjarbaru, Banjarmasin, Balangan, and Barito Kuala.

Through its disaster monitoring portal - InaRisk, Indonesia’ Disaster Monitoring Agency has listed 13 districts6 in South Kalimantan as moderate-risk and high-risk flood areas. Moreover, Indonesia’s BMKG has also issued flood warnings for the above-mentioned districts. All districts currently affected by flooding are included in the list.

Flooding in Banjar, 12 January 2021

On 12 January 2021, significant heavy rain, which started in the first week of January caused Martapura and Riam rivers to overflow, flooding seven sub-districts in Banjar. As of 19 January, seven sub-districts; Karang Intan, East Martapura, Martapura, Astambul, Sungai Pinang, Pengaron, and Tabuk River were inundated with water level ranging from 20 - 100cm.

Based on PMI Situation Report no. 7 dated 19 January 2021, PMI estimated that 27,368 housing units inundated, and 4 bridges have been destroyed. Approximately 30,778 families and 120,416 people are affected by the floods. Over 32,113 people have been evacuated to several temporary shelters that are using school buildings, village halls, mosques, and a football stadium.A more detailed information regarding current evacuation centres is still unavailable.

Flooding in Tanah Laut, 12 January 2021

In Tanah Laut, on 12 January 2021, heavy rainfall which started in the prior week caused severe flooding. In this region, the ongoing high tide further deteriorates the flooding situation. Flooding impacts nine sub-districts; Pelaihari, Bati-bati,

Kurau, Bumi Makmur, Tambang Ulang, Bajuin, Takisung, Jorong, and Kintap were affected. In some areas the water level reaches 150 - 200cm.

The impacts of flooding in Tanah Laut are severe. About 8,506 houses are inundated. Several public facilities such as schools, places of worship, hospitals, and markets have also been impacted. Several roads are also completely submerged in water, including the Trans Kalimantan Access Route. Approximately 8,870 families and 27,815 people are affected by the floods. There have been 10 reported fatalities as a result of being swept away by current and buried by landslide. So far, 13,062 people have sought safety in several temporary shelters. The displaced persons are taking shelter in school buildings and relatives’ homes.

Flooding in Tapin, 14 January 2021

Excessive rainfall on 14 January caused the flooding to spread to wider areas. Flooding in Tapin Regency was observed at 01:00 local time, occurred in Binuang sub-district, Raya Belanti Village. As of 16 January, 515 households and 1,492 people have been affected. As of 19 January, 328 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in Hulu Sungai Tengah, 14 January 2021

In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, flooding occurred on 13 January 2021, at 23.00 local time. Two sub-districts were inundated, namely Barabai and Hantakan. In some areas, the water level was reaching 200cm. As of 19 January 2021, 16,100 households and 64,400 people have been affected by the floods. There have been 3 reported fatalities in the district. Thus far, 11,200 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in other regions (Balangan, Banjarbaru,Hulu Selatan, and Hulu Sungai Utara), 14 January 2021 In Balangan district, floods occurred because of the overflowing of the Balangan and Pitap Rivers, affecting Tebing Tinggi sub-district (Mayanau Village, Gunung Batu, Sungsum, Ju'uh, Bumbu'an Simpang, Simpang Nadung and Tebing Tinggi), and Awayan sub-district (Putat Basiun Village, Awayan Market, Badalungga, Badalungga Hilir, Pulantan and Muara Jaya). In this district, 3,941 houses inundated and 6,235 families or 19,100 people have been affected.

In Banjarbaru, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed the Kemuning River. Flooding was observed at around 01:10 local time with a water level of 50 - 90cm. Two sub-districts affected are Kemuning Village (Banjarbaru sub-district) and Guntung Payung Village (Landasan Ulin sub-district). As of 19 January 2021, 2,116 households and 5,752 people have been affected by the flood. There has been one reported fatality.

Flooding also occurred in Hulu Sungai Selatan district, inundated six sub-districts: Loksado, Padang Batung,

Kandangan, Angkinang, Telaga Langsat and Sungai Raya, with water levels reaching 150cm. In this district, 1,000 housing units submerged in water, affecting about 3,138 families and 6,690 people. As of 19 January 2021, the water has receded.

In Hulu Sungai Utara, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed Balangan and Tabalong rivers, flooding 4 sub-districts. According to PMI’s situation report dated 19 January 2021, 7,865 households and 25,189 people have been affected by the flood. A total of 6,804 housing units were inundated.

As of 19 January 2021, in PMI’s targeted areas approximately 39,874 houses have been inundated. About 56,263 families and 214,123 people are affected by the floods. Indonesia’s meteorological agency has warned that heavy rainfall with thunderstorm and wind is still expected to occur over the next few days in almost all districts in South Kalimantan.

Although this flooding event is only impacting one province, it is impacting over 300,000 people and all districts within the province and has the potential to worsen further in the coming weeks as heavy rains continue. Furthermore, the flood response and evacuation efforts face considerable complications due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 also poses great risk in South Kalimantan since there have been a total of 16,505 cases detected in the province as of 15 January 2021, with 1,250 active cases.

Due to these complexities the disaster has been classified as a category orange."

Situation Analysis

Description of the disaster

The CRCS´s has formulated this Emergency Plan of Action plan to prepare and respond to the likely effects by the 2021 La Niña phenomenon in the country. This plan prepared by CRCS is a preventive activation plan, which means it consist of activities that the National Society will carry out prior to the potential emergency to be ready to respond immediately when the event occurs.

La Niña is a phenomenon composed by both, positive weather anomalies in some places and negative weather anomalies in others. In Colombia, the positive anomalies usually manifest as an increase in rainfall in the Andean, Caribbean, and Pacific regions, as well as the Plain Foothills of the Eastern Plains. While the negative anomalies present by a decrease in the sea surface temperatures in Eastern regions of the Orinoquía and Amazonia. However, while certain events and impacts are expected to occur, exceptional events may happen as well. For example, in 2010, there were slight precipitations in the centre and southern areas of the Orinoquía region.

According to the National System for the Prevention and Attention of Disasters (SNPAD), between 6 April to 10 November 2010, the rainy season associated with La Niña, left 1,170,480 people affected in 549 municipalities, 28 departments and the Capital District of Bogotá. A total of 117 people died, 191 were injured and 20 were missing. A total of 1,654 homes were destroyed and 196,662 were damaged. Of those, 94 per cent of the injured people and 95 per cent of the damaged houses were directly affected by the floods. The most affected departments by the rainy season were as follows: Bolívar, Magdalena, Córdoba and Sucre. This experience shows the historical impacts La Niña has had, especially on shelter and the importance of using forecast information available to better prepare for an early response to this phenomenon.

As reported by the Colombian Meteorological Service (IDEAM), in its climate forecast bulletin N°11, published in November 2020, La Niña conditions are currently present in Colombia. Therefore, it is estimated that within the following months, since December 2020 until March of 2021, rains will be above historical values in ample sectors of the Caribbean, Andean, Pacific and Orinoquía regions. Compared to the 2010, events in 2021 unexpected events are likely to happen in a similar fashion.

The probabilities of the cooling in the equatorial Pacific Ocean range between 85 per cent and 90 per cent. The persistence of these climate conditions favours La Niña phenomenon, which is likely to remain in 2020 and during the first part of 2021. The extreme temperatures in November fluctuated between 3° to 10° degrees Celsius, which reiterates the continuity of this phenomenon. Particularly in the Caribbean insular area, higher than normal rainfall of up to 40 per cent is expected. Similarly, in the Andean, Pacific, Orinoquía and the northern Amazon region, rainfall increases up to 60 per cent are expected.

January is usually a time in which, compared to previous months, precipitation volumes significantly decrease in most regions of Colombia. In January and February 2021, however, rainfall excesses of up to 50 per cent are forecast for a large part of the Caribbean region, northern Pacific, Andean region, and central west of the Eastern Plains. For the rest of the country, an increase of up to 40 per cent in heavy rains is expected.

According to IDEAM climate forecast (both deterministic and probabilistic), published in its report No. 11 (20 November 2020) (see figure 1) there is a 97 per cent to 100 per cent probability that a colder season will arise in the first quarter of 2021. This season may be linked to the first rainy season, which is due to start in March 2021."

The research, published Jan. 11 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, helps to resolve a long-standing debate about the role of climate change in the rising costs of flooding and provides new insight into the financial costs of global warming overall.

“The fact that extreme precipitation has been increasing and will likely increase in the future is well known, but what effect that has had on financial damages has been uncertain,” said lead author Frances Davenport, a PhD student in Earth system science at Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). “Our analysis allows us to isolate how much of those changes in precipitation translate to changes in the cost of flooding, both now and in the future.”

The global insurance company Munich Re calls flooding “the number-one natural peril in the U.S.” However, although flooding is one of the most common, widespread and costly natural hazards, whether climate change has contributed to the rising financial costs of flooding – and if so, how much – has been a topic of debate, including in the most recent climate change assessments from the U.S. government and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

At the crux of that debate is the question of whether or not the increasing trend in the cost of flooding in the U.S. has been driven primarily by socioeconomic factors like population growth, housing development and increasing property values. Most previous research has focused either on very detailed case studies (for example, of individual disasters or long-term changes in individual states) or on correlations between precipitation and flood damages for the U.S. overall.

In an effort to close this gap, the researchers started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data. They then applied advanced methods from economics to quantify the relationship between historical precipitation variations and historical flooding costs, along with methods from statistics and climate science to evaluate the impact of changes in precipitation on total flooding costs. Together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S., and that exceeding the levels of global warming agreed upon in the United Nations Paris Agreement is very likely to lead to greater intensification of the kinds of extreme precipitation events that have been most costly and devastating in recent decades.

“Previous studies have analyzed pieces of this puzzle, but this is the first study to combine rigorous economic analysis of the historical relationships between climate and flooding costs with really careful extreme event analyses in both historical observations and global climate models, across the whole United States,” said senior author and climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, the Kara J Foundation Professor at Stanford Earth.

“By bringing all those pieces together, this framework provides a novel quantification not only of how much historical changes in precipitation have contributed to the costs of flooding, but also how greenhouse gases influence the kinds of precipitation events that cause the most damaging flooding events,” Diffenbaugh added.

The researchers liken isolating the role of changing precipitation to other questions of cause and effect, such as determining how much an increase in minimum wage will affect local employment, or how many wins an individual player contributes to the overall success of a basketball team. In this case, the research team started by developing an economic model based on observed precipitation and monthly reports of flood damage, controlling for other factors that might affect flooding costs like increases in home values. They then calculated the change in extreme precipitation in each state over the study period. Finally, they used the model to calculate what the economic damages would have been if those changes in extreme precipitation had not occurred.

“This counterfactual analysis is similar to computing how many games the Los Angeles Lakers would have won, with and without the addition of LeBron James, holding all other players constant,” said study co-author and economist Marshall Burke, an associate professor of Earth system science.

Applying this framework, the research team found that – when totaled across all the individual states – changes in precipitation accounted for 36 percent of the actual flooding costs that occurred in the U.S. from 1988 to 2017. The effect of changing precipitation was primarily driven by increases in extreme precipitation, which have been responsible for the largest share of flooding costs historically.

“What we find is that, even in states where the long-term mean precipitation hasn’t changed, in most cases the wettest events have intensified, increasing the financial damages relative to what would have occurred without the changes in precipitation,” said Davenport, who received a Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship in 2020.

The researchers emphasize that, by providing a new quantification of the scale of the financial costs of climate change, their findings have implications beyond flooding in the U.S.

“Accurately and comprehensively tallying the past and future costs of climate change is key to making good policy decisions,” said Burke. “This work shows that past climate change has already cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars, just due to flood damages alone.”

The authors envision their approach being applied to different natural hazards, to climate impacts in different sectors of the economy and to other regions of the globe to help understand the costs and benefits of climate adaptation and mitigation actions.

“That these results are as robust and definitive as they are really advances our understanding of the role of historical precipitation changes in the financial costs of flooding,” Diffenbaugh said. “But, more broadly, the framework that we developed provides an objective basis for estimating what it will cost to adapt to continued climate change and the economic value of avoiding higher levels of global warming in the future.”"

But while there is no denying Queensland's rainfall events of late 2010 and early 2011 were exceptional, Brisbane had flooded before — and it will flood again.

It is a history we can ill afford to forget as we continue to live and build on the flood plain.

Floods of the 1800s

The most astounding thing about floods in Brisbane is that they continue to take us by surprise.

Even the official Commission of Inquiry set up in the wake of the 2011 floods stated:

""The disastrous floods which struck south-east Queensland in the week of January 10, 2011 were unprecedented, in many places completely unexpected, and struck at so many points at once that no government could be expected to have the capacity to respond seamlessly and immediately everywhere, and in all ways needed.""

Yet there have been many examples of floods in Brisbane before 2011.

Droughts in the early 1900s and subsequent dams have resulted in less minor and moderate flooding. ( Supplied: BOM )

Peaks in 1841, 1893 and 1974 all eclipsed 2011's mark on the Brisbane gauge, and Indigenous knowledge and the soil record shows floods occurred in the catchment well before European settlement.

The first flood since European settlement was also the biggest, when the Brisbane city gauge reached 8.43 metres in 1841.

The only time this level has been challenged since was in 1893 when an ex-tropical cyclone, followed by yet more rain, brought about two major flood peaks just centimetres short of the 1841 level, with a third smaller peak in between.

The triple flood in just over a fortnight destroyed both the Victoria and Indooroopilly bridges, and newspaper reports at the time estimated 500 homes were washed down the river.

Margaret Cook, an environmental historian, tells the tale of Eleanor Bourne, who lived in West End and was on holiday at Redcliffe in February 1893.

""The first time she knew there was a flood happening in Brisbane was when she found her gate washed up on the beach,"" Dr Cook said.

""That would be quite a shocking way to find that your house is flooded.""

Dr Cook is the author of A River With A City Problem, a history of flood and the management thereof in the Brisbane River.

Newstead was inundated in 1893. ( Sourced: John Oxley Library )

""I chose that title because I wanted to make it obvious that, in my opinion and scientifically, the river came first.

""The river was here and British settlers arrived and settled on a flood plain, and then the problem begins.""

Debate about how to protect Brisbane and control the flooding date back almost as far.

Dam construction

In a piece of history that will surprise few, there were many calls for reform, reports commissioned, blanching at costs and delays before there was a decisive action to manage the flood risk.

According to Dr Cook, Somerset Dam was first mooted after the 1893 disaster, but little was done until the 1930s when Brisbane was faced with a severe drought.

""That really gave us some momentum to build a dam which would provide water supply and also hold back the floods,"" she said.

Brisbane's CBD was inundated in January 1974. ( Royal Historical Society of Queensland )

It also doubled as an employment project, so in 1959 Somerset became the first dual-purpose dam in the Southern Hemisphere.

In a twist on the common narrative, the construction of Wivenhoe Dam was also largely driven by the need for water.

As far back as the 1960s it was clear Somerset Dam would be unable to meet Brisbane's rapidly growing water needs by the 1980s.

The 1974 floods certainly provided incentive to speed up the process of a new dam.

Dam and be damned

Wivenhoe and Somerset dams provide Brisbane with drinking water and reduce the flood risk — but they have drawbacks:

They can cause complacency

Before their construction we used to get floods quite regularly, making us more aware of flood, but now we are far more unconscious of the fact Brisbane does flood, Dr Cook said.

Humans have an extraordinary capacity to forget or ignore inconvenient past tragedy in favour of hoping for the best.

The dual purpose limits flood mitigation

Brisbane relies on the water held in the dams and they can run low, as anyone who lived through the four-minute showers of the millennium drought will be able to testify.

But if the dams are filled to the brim to maximise our water stores for the next drought, it leaves no capacity to absorb or delay the next flood.

Only a section of the catchment is covered

A key limitation of the dams is that they only capture water from the northern section of the Brisbane River catchment.

Rainfall recorded in the 96 hours to 9:00am on January 13, 2011. ( Supplied: BOM )

The dams have no control over run-off from the Lockyer Valley, Bremer River or local catchments downstream from Wivenhoe.

So where exactly the water falls has a big impact on how high the flood is in Brisbane.

""That's the problem of flood modelling, isn't it? That it's all based on ifs, buts and maybes,"" Dr Cook said.

None of the water that devastated Grantham in 2011 or which caused the Bremer River to reach 19.4 metres in Ipswich could have been stopped by the Wivenhoe or Somerset dams.

Modern floods

Cyclone Wanda in 1974 was a relatively weak cyclone — but that did not prevent it from dumping huge amounts of rain on the Brisbane River catchment as an ex-tropical cyclone, resulting in the city's biggest flood since 1893.

An aerial shot of the 1974 Brisbane floods. ( State Library of Queensland )

In contrast, there was no cyclone in 2011, just huge amounts of rain over several months resulting in saturated catchments up and down the Queensland coast.

According to Andrew Watkins, head of climate monitoring at the Bureau of Meteorology, 1973-74 and 2010-11 were the two strongest La Niñas on record, indicating climatic conditions primed to bring rain.

In 2011, by the time Brisbane reached its flood peak on January 13, more than 20 Queensland towns had experienced a flood peak with significant effects, according to the BOM, some multiple times.

The most devastating impacts were witnessed in Toowoomba and Grantham where a wall of water swept away cars, homes and lives.

In Brisbane, the city gauge at the end of Edward Street reached 4.46 metres; in Ipswich, the Bremer River reached 19.4 metres.

It becomes more difficult to compare floods post dam completion, but according to the BOM's analysis of known floods in the Brisbane and Bremer river basin:

""Inflows into Somerset and Wivenhoe dams were nearly double those of 1974 and can be compared to the 1893 flood event.""

Modelling that shows how the dams influenced the overall flood height in Brisbane city. ( Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry Final Report Chapter 16 )

Modelling presented to the Commission of Inquiry showed that without the dams, the peak of the 2011 flood would have reached approximately six metres at the Port Office gauge.

That is higher than the 1974 flood peak but over two metres less than in 1841 and 1893.

Flood maps for the 1974 and 2011 floods are available on the Brisbane City Council website.

Some sought to damn management

Many in Brisbane believed Wivenhoe Dam was supposed to prevent the city from flooding again, so as the waters abated, it did not take long for the muddy finger-pointing to start.

With much debate in the public sphere, the Commission of Inquiry covered at length how and if the dam operators used the dam operation manual and its ""W"" strategies.

Lang Park under water during the 2011 floods. ( Nearmap.com )

As part of the inquiry, the commission hired independent expert hydrologist Mark Babister.

""Mr Babister concluded, in light of the information available at the time, that, allowing for the limits of the strategies in the Wivenhoe manual, the flood engineers achieved close to the best possible flood mitigation result for the January 2011 flood event,"" the inquiry's final report stated.

The chapter on the management of the operation of the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams concluded:

""There is, it is obvious, plenty of scope for argument about whether adherence to the manual strategies would have made a difference to the way in which the flood engineers actually operated the dam; but the possibility certainly exists that they would have responded more quickly to the developing conditions of January 9 had their mindset been one of applying strategy W3. ""Ascertaining the practical result of acting more quickly also is subject to the uncertainties inherent in the modelling; but again, the possibility exists of at least some improvement in the flooding outcome for Brisbane and Ipswich.""

The Queensland Government, Seqwater and Sunwater were all found liable in a class action in 2019 for the negligent operation of the dams that worsened the flooding.

The dam operators are currently appealing this finding.

The decade since

Since 2011 residences in Grantham have been moved to higher ground, but areas in Brisbane continue to be developed despite the fact they fall within the 1974 and 2011 flood zones.

Much of the southern suburb of Fairfield went under in 2011. ( Nearmap.com )

Architect James Davidson, whose practice JDA specialises in climate change mitigation and flooding, is not a believer in clearing out the flood plain per se.

""What I am really interested in is more appropriate forms of development,"" he said.

""We can design our way around a lot of the issues.""

He said there had been a general recognition since 2011 that there was a problem to be dealt with in Brisbane.

An example is the Flood Resilient Homes Program, in which Brisbane City Council is providing funding and expertise to make flood-prone properties better able to handle rising water.

New regulations also require a habitable floor above the flood level.

The council's website provides this searchable map with information on past floods and flood likelihood. ( Brisbane City Council )

When looking at property in Brisbane, it is important to do your research; maps of various flood types and likelihoods are available on the Brisbane City Council website.

Bearing in mind the record on which these maps are based is short, every event is different and multiple one-in-100-year events can happen in your lifetime.

Living in the flood zone is the reality for many — it is about being aware of and managing the risks.

""It will happen again. It's just a matter of when,"" Dr Cook said.

This year

This year is also a La Niña, but so far it has been weaker and rainfall has been significantly less than in the lead up to 2011, according to the BOM's Dr Watkins.

""Having said that, we do have to remember February and March is the peak of the tropical cyclone season,"" he said.

A cyclone or ex-tropical cyclone coming through would certainly wet up the catchment.

""While we have a La Niña, we always have to be cautious in Queensland, but having said that, the risk would not be as high this year as it was in 2011."""

The country's meteorology, climatology and geophysical agency (BMKG) had issued heavy rain alerts across populous Java island, Bali and parts of eastern Indonesia.

Indonesia frequently suffers floods and landslides, particularly during the rainy season from November to March.

President Joko Widodo in October warned of the hazardous impact of the La Nina weather pattern, like flooding, landslides and agriculture losses, after BMKG indicated monthly rain volume could increase by 20 percent-40 percent above normal levels.

The flooding came days after a factory manufacturing batik, a traditional method of creating dyed material and fabrics, was inundated, flooding a nearby village and producing surreal, blood-red waters."

On 22 June, heavy rainfalls caused rivers and creeks in the north-eastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina to swell and flood houses and roads along their banks, forcing many to fear for their lives and properties. The most critical situation was in Tuzla Canton, where traffic was stopped on the main road connecting city of Tuzla with Sarajevo to the south and Orašje to the north while the city’s connection to the north-western town of Doboj was also jeopardized. The mayor of Tuzla at the proposal of the City Civil Protection Headquarters made a decision to declare a state of natural disaster due to the danger of floods and landslides in the city of Tuzla, which includes eight out of nine municipalities in Tuzla Canton (see map in annex).

Đurđevik, in the municipality of Živinice was underwater, 200 residential buildings and 100 auxiliary buildings were flooded. Local traffic, and traffic towards Sarajevo on the main road (M-18) was interrupted due to flooding. Some families were evacuated to their relatives and close friends that are living away from flooded areas, while several refused to evacuate. Besides damages on the houses, damage was also reported on agricultural crops. The situation was complicated by the incessant rain. The situation was also difficult in the municipality of Sapna, where issues were caused by the rivers Sapna and Nezučki potok, as well as in the area of the City of Gračanica, where all watercourses in Tuzla Canton flow into the Spreča riverbed.

In the town of Kladanj, 266 households (HHs) were flooded with 1,000 persons affected, of whom 535 were evacuated. Most of them moved to houses of families and friends, and some slept in local Mosques.

In the city of Lukavac, 100 HHs were flooded where 7,000 people were affected by river Spreča. Most affected and vulnerable were 300 persons from Roma communities.

The rivers Gnjica and Šibošnica threatened the inhabitants of the Municipality of Čelić, and the most difficult situation was in the settlements of Brnjik, Drijenča, Nahvioci, Šibošnica and Čelić (for detailed breakdown please see the Emergency Plan of Action).

Landslides were a further problem in the Tuzla Canton. Most of them were in the area of Sapna, Banovići and Srebrenik, where residential buildings were also endangered. According to the data of the Civil Protection of Tuzla Canton, 16 landslides were reported in the region, which, in addition to the hindering the flow of vehicles and damage to the road infrastructure, also endangered residential buildings. In the area of Srebrenik, eight landslides were reported, which endangered residential buildings and houses.

In the Republic of Srpska (RS) area of Zvornik, the rivers Sapna and Hoča overflowed from the riverbed, and drainage canals flooded more than 30 houses affecting 125 persons in the settlements of Karakaj, Čelopek, Ulice, Donji Grbavci, and Cer. In Srebrenica, the rain was falling with a strong intensity, and due to a large amount of water and sediment, one of the culverts on the Guber promenade was blocked. 20 Households were flooded affecting 70 persons. In municipality of Teslić 40 HHs were flooded with 90 persons affected. Municipalities Valencia in eastern part of RS and Petrovo in Doboj region had 10 HHs flooded affecting 70 persons. 30 HHS were flooded in city of Zvornik affecting 125 persons.

Floods significantly affected road infrastructure, educational institutions (schools) and water supply lines in some municipalities in Tuzla canton. In Kladanj, the elementary school that has been used to house migrants en route was also affected. Some local health facilities have been closed due to flooding but were reopened after one week.

Agriculture also sustained major damages, as many crops and orchards were destroyed by floods. This directly affected the livelihood of people living in the region since the flooding mainly affected rural areas where people are relying on agriculture. In addition to this, on 7 June the region of Gradačac had a massive hailstorm that severely damaged orchards and crops causing nearly 100% damage.

As of the 1 February the COVID-19 situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is stable, the number of daily cases is dropping comparing to previous two months of the pandemic. Government still keeps measures such as wearing of the mask in public places and movement limitations between 11 PM and 5 AM. The number of active cases is 21,987.

In summary, the overall number of flooded households was 749. Over 10,000 persons were affected and over 900 persons were evacuated."

“It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,” Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of the river in Raini village, told Reuters by phone. “I felt that even we would be swept away.”

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said 125 people were missing but the number could rise. So far, the bodies of seven people had been recovered.

Twelve people who had been trapped in a tunnel had been rescued and efforts were under way to save others caught in another tunnel, the federal home ministry said after a meeting of the National Crisis Committee, comprising top officials.

“India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter.

State utility NTPC said the avalanche had damaged a part of its Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower plant that was under construction further down the river. It gave no details but said the situation is being monitored continuously.

Indian military helicopters were flying over the area and soldiers deployed for help with relief and rescue.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous, put its riverside areas on high alert.

‘HIMALAYAN TSUNAMI’

It was not immediately clear what had set off the avalanche at a time when it is not the flood season. In June 2013, record monsoon rains in Uttarakhand caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the “Himalayan tsunami” because of the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi’s party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

“When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountains.

Environmental experts called for a halt to big hydroelectric projects in the state.

“This disaster again calls for a serious scrutiny of the hydropower dams building spree in this eco-sensitive region,” said Ranjan Panda, a volunteer for the Combat Climate Change Network that works on water, environment and climate change issues.

By Kabir Agarwal

At least 31 people have died and 175 are missing after a flash flood in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand in India, once again bringing into spotlight the destabilising impacts of global warming on the Himalayas.

Rock, ice, debris and water flowing at high speeds swept away hydroelectric projects and people in its path on Sunday, before it mellowed around 100 kilometres downstream.

Mujeem Khan, a daily wage labourer earning 500 rupees a day ($7), was working near a tunnel at the Tapovan hydropower project, where 150 of his colleagues got trapped. He says he survived narrowly. “Luckily, I was a little higher up the slope when the flood hit,” he told Climate Home News.

Khan heard what sounded like a massive blast, turned around and saw water and debris dragging away members of his extended family. “My brother and other relatives were working right where the flood hit. I saw them being washed away into the tunnel.” He had little hope of their being found alive.

As of 12 noon local time Tuesday, the Uttarakhand state government reported that 31 dead bodies had been recovered, of whom 29 had been identified. More than 48 hours after the incident, 175 people were unaccounted for.

While scientists and experts are still working to pinpoint what triggered the flood, the working hypothesis is that due to a rock slide, a large chunk of glacier broke at an altitude over 5,500 metres above sea level.

The ice and rock fell into a glacial lake, causing the banks to burst and water to gush down the steep and narrow gorges of the upper Himalayas. The number and area of glacial lakes has increased in the mountain range due to climate change.

Floodwaters smashed into the Rishi Ganga hydroelectric project at around 3,700 metres above sea level and washed it away entirely. According to the chief minister of Uttarakhand Trivendra Rawat, at least 35 people working at the project are missing. Concrete and debris from the Rishi Ganga project were then carried downstream and smashed into the under-construction 520MW Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project, causing massive damage.

The disaster was made more likely by climate change, according to Mohammed Farooq Azam, an assistant professor of glaciology and hydrology at the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore. “Yes, warming temperatures are making events like avalanches, ice fall and landslides more frequent. Erratic weather patterns like increased snowfall and rainfall play a role as do warmer winters,” Azam said.

Avalanches are rare in February in the upper reaches of the Himalayas as the snow and ice remain frozen due to low temperatures. This year, however, has been warmer than normal and in January Uttarakhand – and the rest of India – saw its highest average temperature in 60 years.

AP Dimri, a professor at the School of Environmental Science at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said the higher reaches of the Himalayas are warming faster than the global average which has led to rapid melting of glaciers. That has, in turn, caused the formation of a large number of glacial lakes. “These lakes also become reservoirs of ice and moraine debris. With an increase in this phenomenon, the breach of glacier lakes poses a severe threat to communities living downstream,” Dimri, who is from Uttarakhand, said.

The damage was aggravated by debris from development projects including the hydropower dams and highways being carried downstream.

In 2013, the calamitous combination of climate change and haphazard development in Uttarakhand led to the deaths of over 6,000 people in flash floods caused by heavy rainfall during the Indian monsoon.

Experts such as Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute in Uttarakhand, had been warning about the risk of such development projects even before 2013. “But the government doesn’t listen when it doesn’t suit them… when we say that project should not be built or that the size should be reduced,” Chopra said.

Chopra argued that the government should pay heed to the views of experts and fix responsibility for this disaster. “Companies and officers who are found to be at fault should be personally held responsible and punished. Only then can we hope for some change,” he said.

RAINI, India Feb 22 (Reuters) - Growing up in a remote tribal village high in the Indian Himalayas, Kundan Singh loved to play on a field by the sparkling Rishiganga river.

The 48-year-old recalls afternoons there competing in sports tournaments, surrounded by forests of pine.

Whatever the role of climate change, which is rapidly heating the world's highest mountains, experts say rampant construction is adding to the burden weighing on rural communities across the Himalayas.

This building boom is creating conflict across the region, as shown by interviews with nearly two dozen Raini villagers, legal and technical documents, satellite imagery and photographs, and correspondence with local officials, some of it not previously reported.

“We wrote letters, we protested, we went to court, we did everything,” Singh said. “But no one heard us.”

JOBS DIDN'T COME

The 150 villagers are members of the Bhutia tribe of historically nomadic shepherds from Tibet, some of whom settled in India after a 1962 war with China closed the border.

Granted protected status with government quotas for jobs and education, many nonetheless live in poverty in the mountainous state, labouring on roads and construction sites, weaving woollen rugs and growing potatoes and pulses on small plots around a bend in the river.

Villagers were initially enthusiastic at the prospect of a power plant that promised jobs, according to court documents, the project’s impact assessment and minutes of a 2006 meeting between village leaders and representatives of the dam.

But the jobs did not come, Singh and other locals said. Those who managed to find work on the dam clashed with the owners over unpaid wages and alleged construction violations, according to court documents.

A paint company from Punjab controlled the dam during initial construction. It has not filed accounts since 2015, and its current directors could not be reached for comment. The project entered bankruptcy before being bought by the Kundan Group in 2018, and finally started operations last year. Executives at the conglomerate did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

As India seeks to nearly double its hydropower capacity by 2030, construction of dams in the region is increasingly leading to disagreements between plant owners and locals, said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, which has studied the conflicts.

“It happens with many projects,” he said. “People want to resist and oppose, but project developers… will always make promises of employment and development.”

In the Alaknanda basin, a cluster of streams that feeds the Ganges river – worshipped as a god by many Hindus – six hydroelectric dams have been constructed, according to Thakkar's nonprofit. Eight more, including the Tapovan dam that was severely damaged in the Feb. 7 floods, are under construction, while a further 24 have been proposed.

A spokeswoman for India’s power ministry said the country has strict measures in place regarding the planning of hydropower projects and the rights of local people are always considered.

MUDDY BANKNOTES, RUBBLE

During the dam’s construction, blasts from explosives were frequent, according to interviews with about 20 residents and court documents.

The use of explosives in construction in the region was criticised after devastating floods in Uttarakhand in 2013, dubbed a ""Himalayan tsunami"" that claimed some 6,000 lives.

In 2019, Singh and his brother took a two-day bus journey to meet with lawyer Abhijay Negi, who recalled them arriving with a bundle of muddy banknotes collected from other residents as payment.

“Please help us save our village,” Singh told him.

Negi helped the men file a case against the Kundan Group unit operating the dam, alleging construction had left behind loose rubble and rocks, according to photographs and diagrams submitted as evidence.

Uttarakhand’s top court ruled there was evidence of “substantial damage” to the area that suggested explosives were being used for illegal mining, though it did not rule on when the damage occurred. The court ordered a local investigation, but it is not clear if this has happened and officials involved could not be reached.

High up on the mountain, almost all the Raini residents survived the floods. But Singh said the disaster has left many dreaming of escape.

“Many want to leave, but I will stay because I have no other option,” he said. “I will stay because of poverty.”

The storm displaced more than 16,000 people, damaged around 17,000 houses, and killed more than a dozen people across a few countries in southeast Africa.

These images show flooding on January 30, 2021, seven days after Eloise made landfall near the coastal city of Beira. The images from December 2019 are provided to compare the area under non-flooded conditions in the same season. The false-color images, acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, use a combination of visible and infrared light (bands 7-5-3) to help differentiate flood water (dark blue), bare land (brown), and vegetation (bright green).

After crossing northern Madagascar and before making landfall on mainland Africa, Eloise slightly strengthened due to warm waters in the Mozambique Channel. Stations in Beira recorded 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain in 24 hours. Several rivers burst their banks, and roads became impassable. Tens of thousands of hectares of farmland were submerged in brown water, which could affect harvest this April. The storm, which brought winds up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour, also blew over trees, power lines, and signs.

Most of the areas hit by Eloise are still recovering from cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019, which claimed hundreds of lives. When Eloise hit, some villages were already flooded. In December 2020, Beira and other surrounding areas endured heavy rains and flooding from severe weather.

After making landfall in Mozambique, Eloise continued across southern Africa, though in a weakened state. The storm caused damage and flooding to South Africa, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe.

While a levee built in 2013 protected the town and about 80 per cent of growers, 20pc of farmers still experienced flooding and had significant amounts of topsoil wash away.

A Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) flood impact assessment team, comprising soil and horticultural specialists, hit the ground in Carnarvon earlier this week.

The team, co-ordinated by vegetable and horticulture systems section lead Neil Lantzke, will be assessing affected properties for soil degradation, damage to equipment and supplies associated with farming and crop losses.

Agriculture and Food Minister Alannah MacTiernan said Carnarvon was built on a flood plain, which was part of what nade it an incredible area for horticulture, but meant there was always going to be a flood risk.

""It is absolutely terrible for those that have been affected, but some of the growers that we talked to that were affected also said that it was such good rain, so there will be a lot of nutrients that they get out of it,"" Ms MacTiernan said.

""We have a team heading out to make an assessment of how much topsoil has been lost and how we can get that back as quickly as possible.

""The assessments will help inform broader impact assessments associated with the floods and also inform options for remediation.""

About 20 growers have so far registered with DPIRD to arrange an assessment.

Other affected growers, who would like to arrange an assessment, can contact DPIRD's Carnarvon office.

Eddie Smith is the owner of Caiden Plantation, a six-hectare mango farm that fortunately finished harvest in January.

While that meant Mr Smith's production was not affected by the floods his property certainly was, with almost the entire growing area going under water.

""For us it's more about the damage to the tracks and the loss of soil and in localised spots, the damage is quite significant,"" Mr Smith said.

""Our block was almost entirely underwater, but luckily we have a concrete flood wall around our house which was effective in keeping the water out of the house itself.

""We managed to get most things up and out of the water in the sheds, so only a few items got damaged, so now it's a matter of cleaning up and getting all the mud out.""

Along with assessing the impact on growers, a team will also be evaluating the performance of the levee.

""The evidence is there to show that the levee has been a useful investment, but now we need to review and fine tune it so we can figure out if it can perform to a higher level and provide protection for even more properties,"" Ms MacTiernan said.

Flood levels at Caiden Plantation.

""Even for the 20pc of growers that were affected, the levee still had an impact as normally with flooding it's a two-way process, so you get flooding from one direction and then the water rushes back down towards the river, but that rush back didn't happen.

""In general, the levee has been a benefit to everyone but we do need to have a look at whether or not all the floodways are being properly protected.""

Mr Smith said as part of that evaluation, options for improving the resilience of the properties that aren't benefited by the levee, need to be looked into.

""It's important to accept that there are some of us that are not going to get a benefit from the very significant expenditure there,"" Mr Smith said.

""To me, it's about making those properties resilient, making sure the river banks can withstand the over-topping and don't scour out.

""I know that there have been several stages of the river bank where they have blown out and the soil gets deposited all over the properties.""

While the clean-up effort has just begun, Ms MacTiernan has put early estimates of the total cost at $25 million to $30m, however that includes the repair to the severely damaged North West Coastal Highway.

A 10 kilometre section of the highway north of Carnarvon, from the Blowholes through Minilya to Burkett Road, was completely washed away with the severity of the floods.

Main Roads media manager Dean Roberts said a temporary access lane over the damaged section of pavement was opened on Monday.

""About 800 tonnes of locally sourced gravel and rock is being used to construct the temporary traffic lane,"" Mr Roberts said.

""The temporary lane on this section will open under traffic control and speed restrictions - traffic will be permitted access on the lane during daytime hours between 7am and 5pm, but it will be closed overnight to ensure safety for road users.

""It is anticipated that this temporary access will be in place for several weeks until permanent repairs to the original road alignment is completed.""

For those that are still producing, it's a case of the sooner the better for that section of road to re-open with full access.

""People that are still in production are being faced with extra costs imposed because the trucks are having to come up empty,"" Mr Smith said.

""Normally they would go up to Karratha and Port Hedland full of stock, then back down the coast to Carnarvon to fill up with produce before heading back south.

""But they're now having to travel up empty and there have been some cost impositions on the growers using transport at the moment."""

India has suffered a huge crop loss on 18.176 million hectares (mha) of land, roughly 8.5 per cent of the total gross cropped area due to floods from 2017-2019, according to data shared by the government in the Lok Sabha February 11, 2021.

Of this, 10.68 mha was affected in 2019 alone. In 2018 and 2017, 2.515 mha and 4.973 mha of cropped area was lost in India. The intensity of extreme floods has increased in the country, affecting newer areas that were not flood-prone earlier.

The flood-prone states of Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh saw extreme floods. They were also witnessed in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan due to ‘excess’ or ‘large excess’ rainfall in these states, combined with extremely heavy rainfall in a short span of time.

Madhya Pradesh was the hardest-hit among all. It had zero crop loss in both 2017 and 2018. However, it suffered the highest loss of 6.047 mha among all states in 2019 due to extreme rainfall, according to the reply given by Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria.

In 2019, the state also saw the second highest claims, after Maharashtra, by farmers for crop insurance under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Other states where crop losses were comparatively more were Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Rajasthan and West Bengal.

Maharashtra’s data was missing from the reply, along with several other states and Union territories like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, that had not reported the data for one year or the other. This also indicates gross underestimation of losses to crops due to floods.

Also, the figures for 2020 were not shared in the reply.

Kataria said the Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP) scheme for flood management worked in the entire country. River management activities and works related to border areas, with an outlay of Rs 3,342 crore, was under implementation from 2017-18 to 2019-20 and later extended upto March, 2021, he added.

Central assistance amounting to Rs 6,409.96 crore had been released till March, 2020 under this programme.

“The Government of India launched the Flood Management Programme during Eleventh Plan period for providing central assistance to the state governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works that was continued during the Twelfth Plan,” the reply stated."

A severe weather warning was in place for the south-west, lower south-west and Great Southern districts.
Reuters reported that six fires in the state’s south-west that authorities said on Sunday were probably deliberately lit were under control.
The Bureau of Meteorology said rainfall of up to 100mm was possible in some areas, with winds gusts likely to hit 100km/h.","soon, place, federal, floods, winds, fires, weather, australia, warning, western, seeks, severe, likely, relief, states, devastating, state, southwest, disaster, follow",floods,Acute climatological event (flood),"The Western Australian government will seek federal disaster relief to help fast-track road repairs after floods in the state’s north-west.

With a flood warning in place for the midwest Gascoyne region on Sunday, roads remain closed and residents were urged to watch for fast-flowing and rising waters.

The premier, Mark McGowan, said the tropical low-pressure system sweeping across the state had caused considerable damage, including to the Northwest Coastal Highway.

He said some closures were likely to remain in place for several weeks but authorities were already working to open the highway as soon as possible.

“Road building crews are ready to deploy as soon as flood levels recede sufficiently to make an on-the-ground assessment of the damage,” he said.

Heavy rains and strong winds were also expected to hit Perth and parts of the state’s south-west on Sunday and into Monday as the low moved down the coast.

A severe weather warning was in place for the south-west, lower south-west and Great Southern districts.

McGowan, said the severe weather came after a challenging week, with parts of the state enduring a five-day lockdown because of a coronavirus outbreak, and devastating bushfires in the Perth hills destroying 86 homes.

Reuters reported that six fires in the state’s south-west that authorities said on Sunday were probably deliberately lit were under control.

The fire and emergency services department said all the suspicious blazes had started about the same time on Saturday evening and were close to each other.

“They’ll have the book thrown at them when they’re caught,” McGowan has said of arsonists.

“If someone has deliberately done it, well then that is just a disgusting, deplorable and disgraceful act. No doubt the arson squad will hunt them down and they’ll go to jail.”

Locations that may be affected by the wild weather include Bunbury, Busselton, Collie, Manjimup, Margaret River, Augusta, Dunsborough, Harvey and Walpole.

The Bureau of Meteorology said rainfall of up to 100mm was possible in some areas, with winds gusts likely to hit 100km/h.

Tides were also likely to be higher than predicted along the west coast north of Augusta, with the potential for flooding in low-lying coastal areas.

The heaviest rainfall recorded to 8am on Sunday included 85mm at Lancelin East and 80mm at Hill River Springs.

The highest wind gusts were 100km/h at Gooseberry Hill and 94km/h at Bickley.

Days of torrential rain have spawned massive flooding in eastern Australia, forcing the evacuation of some 40,000 people. In the country's arid central section, it has sent waterfalls down the side of the country's majestic Uluru rocks.

Barely a year after devastating bush fires burned through tens of millions of acres in Australia, the country is grappling with one of its worst floods after weather systems converged over Queensland and New South Wales, dumping more than 20 inches of rain in a single day in one area north of Brisbane.

Meanwhile, one area of New South Wales received nearly 40 inches in a week — which Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said had already exceeded the average autumn rainfall less than a month into the season.

The floods, which have submerged houses, stranded cattle and cut off towns, have inundated vast areas along the east coast from roughly Mackay, about 600 miles north of Brisbane in Queensland, to Bega in New South Wales, some 260 miles south of Sydney.

The premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, said Wednesday that residents in Sydney's western regions are under new evacuation orders.

""What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,"" she told reporters in Sydney, Reuters reported.

Near Alice Springs in central Australia, tourists have flocked to Uluru, also known Ayers Rock, to catch a rare glimpse of cascading waterfalls at the reddish-orange rock formation. Park officials said 46 millimeters (1.8 inches) of rain fell there over the weekend – about a sixth of the average annual rainfall in the region. While the event isn't unprecedented, it is uncommon.

""Rainwater on the rock's surface causes it to change [color]. From dark burgundy to shining silver and even black, every side of Uluru takes a different shade, making this spectacle a photographer's delight. Following the rain, desert plants bloom and many animals emerge to mate and feed,"" staff at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park said on Facebook.

Although rivers were expected to crest on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that the flooding, which has been concentrated along the eastern seaboard, would not remain ""just a coastal event.""

The Warragamba Dam, on the western outskirts of Sydney, has been spilling the equivalent of the city's famous harbor in water each day. It's expected to continue its overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas, Morrison said. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" he said.

Darren Osmotherly, who owns the Paradise Café Pizzeria in Portland in North South Wales, west of Sydney, told Reuters that damage to his restaurant would likely top a half-million Australian dollars ($380,000).

The national weather agency posted weather warnings in every mainland state or territory but one, affecting around 10 million people in the country of 25 million, across an area the size of Alaska.

“The rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters.

No deaths were reported, but thousands of people have been rescued by emergency services in recent days. Authorities have ordered about 22,000 people to be ready to flee their homes, potentially joining around 18,400 people who have already been evacuated.

Images shared on social media showed bridges washed away, stranded animals and submerged homes in New South Wales, the most populous and worst affected state.

One video showed a container truck ramming into a bridge, causing structural damage, while another showed a car swept off a road by raging floodwaters in neighbouring Queensland.

Other photos captured mass swarms of spiders and snakes as the creatures sought to escape the fast-moving flood waters.

In NSW, a fourth straight day of heavy rain was expected to combine with a coastal trough and increase the deluge overnight on Tuesday, even as the main city Sydney saw a reprieve by late afternoon.

Thousands of people who live along the Hawkesbury River, a major waterway about 60km (37 miles) north of Sydney, were told to be ready to evacuate.

Dave Murray, a landscaper from North Richmond, on the Hawkesbury, filmed with a head-mounted camera from his jetski as he rescued his neighbour’s 10 cows by forcing them to swim about 300 metres through floodwater five metres deep.

“I knew they could swim because I’ve done it before, but I didn’t realise they could swim as good as that,” Murray said by telephone.

Emergency workers used inflatable rafts and even some surf boats, usually reserved for beach rescues, to reach stranded locals, Reuters footage showed.

“We’ve got a place on the other side of the river and we just came over to move our van onto high ground and were trapped on the other side of the river, with the landslides, so we’ve been there for a couple of days,” Pitt told Reuters.

Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s main water supply, began overflowing on Saturday and was expected to keep doing so for another week. The summer before, amid drought and bushfires, the same dam fell below half its water catchment, triggering severe water restrictions.

LOGISTICS LAG

Authorities began coordinating with supermarkets to ship groceries to people who could not get to a store, Federal Emergency Management minister David Littleproud said.

Grocery chain Coles Group Ltd planned to deliver essentials to stores near the Hawkesbury on Tuesday. Rival grocer Woolworths Group Ltd said it closed several stores due to staff safety concerns and warned of delivery delays as trucks were re-routed to avoid flooded roads.

Coal deliveries to Port of Newcastle, north of Sydney, the world’s biggest coal export port, were halted earlier because flooding shut rail lines.

On Tuesday, the country’s biggest independent coal miner, Whitehaven Coal Ltd, said it was forced to stop shiploading at the port due to structural faults, while weather-related port restrictions were slowing ship movements.

The company said road flooding may also stop staff driving to work and cut its forecast coal sales to a range of 18.5 million to 19 million tonnes, from a range of 19 million to 20 million previously."

With weather conditions getting worse, companies and government officials were still assessing the impact, but market participants expect more rail and port infrastructure to be affected in coming days.

Miner Glencore said in a statement March 23 about its coal operations that it had taken ""precautionary measures, including the decision to operate at reduced capacity at some sites"" and that train movements to the Port of Newcastle had been delayed due to flooding on some parts of the track.

'We continue to monitor the current weather events across NSW and have robust infrastructure installed at each of our sites to minimize impacts,"" Glencore said, adding that it was business as usual at its Queensland coal operations.

Glencore is one of Australia's largest coal producers with a mixture of open cut and underground coal mines across New South Wales and Queensland.

Another major coal producer Yancoal Australia Ltd said March 23 that heavy rainfall since March 19 had caused the suspension of production at two of Yancoal's open-cut mines in the Hunter Valley region, mainly the Mount Thorley Warkworth as well as the Stratford and Duralie mines.

""There have also been interruptions to rail transportation and port operations. Given the rain event is anticipated to continue over the coming days, it is too early to provide an accurate indication of the extent of these production interruptions,"" Yancoal said in a statement.

However, Yancoal said its mines in regions outside the Hunter Valley, such as Moolarben in the Central West of NSW and Queensland operations, have not been impacted by the rains.

Ports and Railways

Rail and port infrastructure have also been disrupted.

The Australian Rail Track Corp temporarily ceased operations through the Hunter Valley network between Newcastle and Maitland and the Interstate Network between Telarah and Grafton due to localized flooding, it said in a statement.

""This was done as a precautionary measure, following extreme weather conditions across the region,"" it said, adding that ""high rainfall, potential for more severe flooding beyond the current impacts to the network, strong winds, fallen trees and debris, power failures and fallen power lines and power poles are all concerns which led to operations being halted.""

""When it is safe to do so, we will begin the process of reopening the tracks by undertaking a full assessment of rail operations however this will not be until conditions are safe and water levels recede,"" ARTC said, adding that it would provide further updates as the situation progresses.""

Australian rail freight operator Aurizon said there was no impact on its operations in Queensland.

The Port of Newcastle said it was monitoring conditions and scheduling vessels in close communication with Port Authority of NSW, and that each vessel is assessed on a case-by-case basis for its suitability at the time of each scheduled movement.

""The shipping schedule is adapted relative to the weather conditions and safety assessments. This type of temporary weather event does not typically have any lasting impact. The port continues to operate and is monitoring conditions closely,"" it said in a statement March 23.

There were 11 ship movements on March 22, compared with an average of 12 on a normal day, and there have been some schedule changes where conditions restricted the pilotage of vessels, but the port said it continued to operate.

The three coal terminals comprise two at Port Waratah Coal Services, Carrington Coal Terminal with a capacity of 25 million mt/year and Kooragang Coal Terminal with a capacity of 120 million mt/year, and one at Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group. The port has 20 berths of which eight are for coal.

Australian coal miner Whitehaven narrowed its fiscal year 2020-21 (July-June) run-of-mine coal production from 21 million mt-22.5 million mt to 21.4 million mt-22 million mt because of port issues and flooding, the company said March 23.

The miner said it made the decision following Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group suspending shiploading at the Port of Newcastle for two weeks for repair work.

An assessment of its shiploader SL1 found faults requiring an expected two weeks of repair work. It's other shiploader SL2 suffered storm-related damage in November and isn't expected back online until October-December, Whitehaven said.

Whitehaven said flooding in New South Wales had elevated the possibility of disruptions to the coal chain.

Meanwhile, shipbrokers said that the number of vessels due to load coal had grown around port limits, and operations at ports further out like Port Waratah and Port Kembla could also be impacted if the flooding continues."

And the Emergency Management Agency has found that the canals and levees in Orkhon province protect only some subdistricts instead of the whole city.
“They talk about the local budget being allocated for building flood barriers,” says Baldorj Delgerbayar, another Erdenet resident.
Erdenet, the capital of Orkhon province, is a mountainous region with natural trenches, dikes and canals.","increase, mongolia, scramble, floods, agency, flood, orkhon, protect, munkhtur, province, population, flooding, barriers, residents",floods,Acute climatological event (flood),"ERDENET, ORKHON PROVINCE, MONGOLIA — Munkhtur Jalbuu lives in a ger – a traditional domed tent also known as a yurt – on the edge of a mountainside in one of Erdenet’s flood-prone communities. Her yard features a phalanx of anti-flooding measures, including a fence, a trench and a low concrete wall.

Munkhtur, 48, does not have much choice. Porous levees and other ineffective barriers bring frequent flooding to her community in the Bayan-Undur region, 378 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of Ulaanbaatar, the capital. So Munkhtur fashioned her own protection.

“Unless we ensure safety of where we live and build flood barriers, we will sink and wash away with everything we have one day,” says Munkhtur, as she uses a piece of wood to push away the garbage that has blown into her trench.

Munkhtur is angry at government officials, whom she accuses of failing to address the perennial threat of floods, a problem that has dogged Mongolia for decades.

As the country’s annual temperatures have climbed, so has the number of floods, which have caused millions of dollars in damage and forced thousands to live in precarious mountainside locales as they struggle to fend off potential disaster.

Annual average temperatures in Mongolia rose by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1940 and 2014, according to a government report. That’s twice as warm as the global average.

In the 1990s, floods were so rare in Orkhon province that officials didn’t even count them. But by the early 2000s, that had begun to change: the Orkhon Emergency Management Agency in Erdenet reports that 14 floods occurred in the Bayan-Undur region between 2005 and 2015, killing five people.

Khorloo Khukhnokhoi, GPJ Mongolia Munkhtur Jalbuu girded her fence with a cement wall to prevent flooding, a problem her community increasingly faces.

Between 2013 and 2018, the city saw eight floods, which killed seven and caused 55.4 billion Mongolian togrogs ($19 million) in damage.

A dramatic leap in annual rainfall has led to more floods. But other factors include an increasingly centralized population, a lack of land-use policy and leaky dams.

And the Emergency Management Agency has found that the canals and levees in Orkhon province protect only some subdistricts instead of the whole city. In fact, an agency report says, most levees are broken.

“They talk about the local budget being allocated for building flood barriers,” says Baldorj Delgerbayar, another Erdenet resident. “But these barriers are not effective at all.”

According to the Emergency Management Agency, state and local authorities approve a budget specifically to fund flood prevention efforts each year.

Erdenebayar Begzjav, a senior inspector for disaster prevention at the Emergency Management Agency, says the budget covers cleaning and repairing levees, digging new trenches and providing citizens with flood warnings and updates.

But “since the approved budget is not enough each year,” he says, “it is impossible to renew dams regularly. However, we are doing the best we can to protect citizens from flood and water disasters.”

The city hopes to repair its dams with $14 million from the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Erdenebayar says, but has yet to receive approval.

Khorloo Khukhnokhoi, GPJ Mongolia Amgalan Nergui, whose neighborhood sees frequent flooding, placed his ger high on a mountainside and surrounded it with used car tires for extra protection.

Orkhon province covers only 84,400 hectares (326 square miles), but its population is 107,634 and growing. The area’s population ballooned by about 17,000 people in the past decade – 8,000 in the last five years alone.

Erdenet, the capital of Orkhon province, is a mountainous region with natural trenches, dikes and canals. As a result, it faces a frequent threat of flooding in warm seasons, when snow melts on the mountains. Rain-fed floods also occur during Mongolia’s spring and summer.

As Erdenet’s population grows, the area available for homes shrinks. At the same time, land sales have increased and prices have jumped, so many opt for low-cost property on the city’s outskirts. The cheapest sites are mountain slopes, floodplains and ravines.

Amgalan Nergui lives in Erdenet’s ger district, home to about 61% of the city’s population. All ger district households sit in flood risk zones.

Gers can easily float away during a flood. Amgalan says he erected his on a hill he built inside his fence. For added protection, he encircled the hill with used tires.

“This is is how we live safely and without fear,” says Amgalan, who lives with his wife and three children.

A gentle, calm mother of four adult children, Munkhtur says that before she installed homemade barriers, flooding often forced her family to move all their furniture to higher ground. “Water used to rage and flow in all of a sudden,” she says.

While she anticipates the government’s response, Munkhtur keeps looking for her own ways to protect her home.

“I live in a high-risk area,” she says, “so I’m always vigilant.”"

A relentless week-long downpour has soaked most of New South Wales, causing surging rivers to burst their banks; swallowing homes, roads, bridges and farmland.

Strained emergency services -- which just one year ago were battling drought and unprecedented bushfires -- used military aircraft and lightweight rubber dinghies to access cut-off communities.

So far, around 850 people have been winched or ferried to safety, but tens of thousands have been told to flee their homes and wild weather has spread to more inland areas.

In hard-hit Windsor, near Sydney, residents traversed the murky debris-strewn torrent on jet skis and other vessels normally seen off the city's golden beaches.

Some coastal regions have received a metre (three feet) of water in a week, the equivalent of two-thirds of normal annual rainfall.

""We've never seen anything like this ever,"" said 50-year-old Jodie Sallustio, who has been stranded by floodwaters surrounding her partner's Port Macquarie home since Friday.

About 18,000 people have already been evacuated across New South Wales, with state Premier Gladys Berejiklian saying the wild weather was now ""impacting a huge area of the state"".

""It is catastrophic in its dimensions and the impact will be severe, and the fact that 15,000 people may need to be evacuated within the next 24 to 48 hours is a huge concern,"" she said.

In parts of the state, residents have begun looking to clean-up efforts but meteorologists have warned that flooding will persist for days even though rainfall is forecast to ease Wednesday.

Thousands remain without power and energy providers warned electricity will not be restored in some areas until later in the week.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main drinking water source, was expected to continue spilling over into already swollen rivers for another week.

Story continues

""This is a complex weather event and becoming more complex,"" he told reporters in Canberra.

WaterNSW, which manages the dam, said the daily overflow had now dropped to half of its peak of 500 gigalitres on Sunday -- roughly equivalent to the total volume of Sydney Harbour.

- More extreme weather expected -

Emergency services have responded to more than 10,000 calls for help.

So far, no fatalities or serious injuries have been reported, but thousands of homes and businesses are believed to have been damaged.

Insurance Council of Australia CEO Andrew Hall said 11,700 claims had already been lodged and ""a large number"" were expected in the coming days.

Organic farmer Rod Bailey said his property near Port Macquarie had suffered ""complete devastation"" with at least 95 percent of its crops destroyed by heavy rains.

""We won't see any income short of three months,"" he told AFP. ""It's a difficult situation we're in but many of our neighbours have had it far worse.""

The Bureau of Meteorology warned Tuesday that ""we are not out of the woods yet"", with half of New South Wales still under emergency weather warnings.

State Emergency Service assistant commissioner Nicole Hogan told public broadcaster ABC another 1,750 volunteers had arrived from interstate to support the efforts in what would be a ""critical 24 hours"".

Flood and severe weather warnings have been extended to areas not previously affected, including the south coast of Sydney and outback areas to the northwest recently crippled by a prolonged drought.

Scientists have warned Australia can expect more frequent and more extreme weather events as a result of climate change.

Just north of New South Wales, parts of Queensland state's populated southeast have also been hit by flooding after days of heavy rain.

Eight million residents in Sydney and across the state have been told to work from home if possible and avoid unnecessary travel.

Health officials have said the rain and floods will delay the already halting roll-out of coronavirus vaccines in Sydney and surrounding areas.

The flood waters continue to rise after more than 1 metre of rainfall has fallen in some areas, flooding hundreds of properties.

With further torrential rainfall expected today, Tuesday, concerns are rising for western Sydney where the Warragamba Dam is expected to overflow for as much as one week.

18,000 people remain evacuated, with a further 15,000 on evacuation watch and the toll is rising for insurance and reinsurance interests as this flood event continues.

As we explained yesterday, our sources suggested that Australia could be looking at another billion dollar catastrophe industry loss event and that reinsurance carriers would pick up some of the bill from the flooding and associated storms.

Now, the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) has highlighted the billion dollar insured loss potential of the floods, saying that while “it is too early to estimate the cost of the damage as access to inundated properties is restricted and many remain isolated, however as a point of comparison insurers paid out almost $1 billion in relation to the February 2020 east coast storms and flooding event.”

The ICA said that the areas with the most insurance claims so far include the NSW mid-north coast towns of Port Macquarie, Kempsey, Laurieton, and Taree, and west of Sydney around Penrith and in the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley.

The majority of households have flood insurance cover in Australia, as it has to be explicitly excluded from policies and many carriers won’t bind cover without flood being included.

However, the ICA noted that, “most residential policyholders who have opted out of flood cover will still be covered for storm-related damage and are encouraged to contact their insurer to obtain an assessment of their particular circumstances.”

Concerns are also rising for Southeast Queensland where the ICA has also noted that a catastrophe declaration could be warranted, but said it is liaising with members on that.

Andrew Hall, CEO of the Insurance Council of Australia said, “This remains an active natural disaster and it will take some time to gain a clearer picture of the damage.

“Insurers expect a large number of claims will be lodged in coming days as property owners begin returning to homes and businesses.

“We encourage policy holders to contact their insurer as soon as practically possible even if they have not been able to return to their home.”

There is a growing expectation that insurers will certainly benefit from their quota share reinsurance protection for this event, but also that some excess of loss reinsurance recoveries are also likely.

Right now, it’s assumed that QBE would be the least exposed of the major carriers, given its commercial property focus, while IAG and Suncorp would be expected to take a more significant burden from the floods.

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service has published some very useful flood inundation maps, which you can access here.

Address the connection between water ownership, distribution and migration: Water ownership and distribution likely influence migration at local, regional and global levels.
Integrate diverse perspectives in water migration assessments: Water co-operation treaties must integrate under-represented, marginalized and racialized migrant voices.
Understand water, migration and peace: There is potential for using water security to promote peace.
Broader approaches could help examine key links between water, migration and peace.","lead, floods, water, droughts, climate, change, women, sevenpoint, waterdriven, migration, help, crises, research, governments, vulnerable, things",floods,Acute climatological event (flood),"Extreme water events affecting water for drinking, cooking, washing and agriculture drive migration all over the world. Earlier this year, cyclone Eloise battered Mozambique, displacing 100,000 to 400,000 people and weakening the country’s infrastructure. People displaced by the storm were in need of food, hygiene kits and personal protective equipment (PPE).

Cyclones are just one form of extreme water events that will play out more frequently and adversely as water crises worsen with climate change. Water extremes and climate change will cause more than one billion people to migrate by 2050.

Migration will be spurred by drought, as in the Sahel in Africa, shortsighted water management, as in the Aral Sea region of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, flooding, as in Bangladesh and small island developing states, and other extremes like cyclones.

Addressing water-driven migration will require research that crosses borders and research boundaries. As climate change continues to cause serious displacement and socio-political upheaval, governments must take action to minimize the effects on people vulnerable to migration.

The stakes of water-driven migration

Water-driven migration is a crucial challenge for people living in vulnerable and unstable regions. Water stress acts as a direct or indirect driver of conflict and migration. As water and climate extremes become worse, more people will face water crises and be forced to migrate.

For instance, take the famous case of the Aral Sea that shrank to 9,830 square kilometres in 2017 from 55,700 square kilometres in the 1970s. More than 100,000 people migrated due to collapse of agriculture, fisheries, tourism and increased illnesses such as tuberculosis and diarrhoea.

Vulnerable populations bear the brunt of impacts on water availability, food production, livelihoods and income. As water and care providers, women and girls carry the burden of fulfilling water needs for their households and families. Women and girls also bear disproportionate health impacts of water crises as more hours are spent organizing household water needs.

A recent report explains that political instability, chronic poverty and inequality and climate change worsen water-driven migration. With at least 33 nations set to face “extremely high (water) stress” by 2040, it is more pressing than ever to face this problem with a strategic approach.

A seven-point strategy

Countries that have committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals could address water-driven migration through SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). Policy can be aligned with SDG 16 along a seven-point strategy:

1. Address the connection between water ownership, distribution and migration: Water ownership and distribution likely influence migration at local, regional and global levels. To capture the scope of water issues, future research must strike a balance between scientific and social aspects of water.

2. Understand how water crises influence migration: Causality is important in addressing migration. Land, water and human security issues could serve as a base for outlining a preventative outlook for new and emerging migration pathways.

3. Integrate diverse perspectives in water migration assessments: Water co-operation treaties must integrate under-represented, marginalized and racialized migrant voices. The United Nations University’s Institute for Water, Environment and Health has developed an approach to aggregate the causes and consequences of water-driven migration. This framework can help policymakers interpret migration in diverse socio-ecological, socio-economic, and socio-political settings.

4. Assess water, migration and development practices through participatory, bottom-up and interdisciplinary approaches: Research should be participatory, applicable between disciplines and socially inclusive to complement scientific, descriptive methods. Nuanced facts of the diverse influences that shape migration can provide understanding to build resilience among vulnerable populations.

5. Manage data, information and knowledge: Researchers need updated data to examine how water crises are linked with human migration. To close the gaps, the UN has pointed to the need to improve capacity for data analysis within and between countries. Also, there must be stronger co-ordination at the state, regional and international levels to share best practices.

6. Apply a gender-sensitive lens: The economic, health and societal effects of water-driven migration affect men, women and children differently. Filling these knowledge gaps will require a gender-sensitive approach to assess causes and effects. Namrata Chindarkar, a water and public policy researcher, has argued that comprehensive and holistic investigations of the states people come from, end up in and transit through must be gender-sensitive if they are to be inclusive.

7. Understand water, migration and peace: There is potential for using water security to promote peace. Broader approaches could help examine key links between water, migration and peace.

Policymakers must prepare for the consequences of water crises by adopting improvements that address the concerns of those vulnerable to migration. The seven-point strategy calls for policymakers to use strategic and integrated approaches between disciplines. Research that maps causes, risks and impacts at the local, regional and global levels can strengthen water migration policies.

The city also floods during the dry season, caused by tidal floods and storm surges. Last year, the city had two devastating storm surges, one in June and one in December. Both times, the sea swelled and breached 1m tall dikes that defend parts of Pekalongan’s coastal areas.

Because of climate change, storm surges have happened more frequently and are of greater intensity.

“During the last tidal flood, a third of Pekalongan was submerged. It has become that severe,” Mdm Kusumorini said.



LACK OF FUNDS

The city plans to construct a massive sea dike to protect around 290,000 inhabitants. The coastal defence system will include building a pumping station at the mouth of Pekalongan’s biggest and most flood-prone waterway, the Loji River.

To stop people from extracting groundwater, the city is also planning to build reservoirs and create an elaborate piping network to distribute fresh water. It also plans to relocate people living at flood-prone riverbanks, build embankments and fix its drainage system which is no longer adequate to cope with extreme rainfall, the consequence of a changing climate.

But these projects come with a hefty price tag and the small city does not have sufficient funds.

“We can only earmark 250 billion rupiah (US$17.7 million) each year for infrastructure projects. This is not a lot. This is why we rely on help from the national and provincial administrations, said Mdm Kusumorini.

In 2019, the central government financed the building of a 2.3km sea dike to protect the western part of the city from the encroaching sea. The project cost the national government 500 billion rupiah."

The State Emergency Service said evacuated residents of Pitt Town North, Pitt Town Bottoms, Cornwallis, North Richmond, Agnes Banks, Gronos Point and Freemans Reach should not return until authorities give the all-clear.

“Even as flood waters recede, utilities will continue to be impacted and there will likely be extensive debris including hazardous materials and potentially unsafe roads,” the SES said in a statement on Sunday.

Evacuation orders on the NSW mid-north coast and near Moree have now lifted, with eight “all clear” return notices issued as river levels fall.

Rapid damage assessments were taking place through western and north-west Sydney in areas such as Penrith, The Hills and Hawkesbury. Some 3,500 assessments have been carried out to date.

“The teams out in the field are working closely with the community and local services to begin the recovery process,” Allison Flaxman of the SES said.

On Sunday, a major flood warning remained in place for the Barwon River in north-west NSW, as well as moderate flood warnings for the Bogan River in the state’s central west and the Macintyre and Weir Rivers near the Queensland border.

The SES has received more than 23,000 calls for help from the public, and volunteers have attended more than 13,000 jobs since the floods began.

Grants and bank loans will be made available to businesses in flood-affected areas to fund their recovery, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced.

Morrison said on Saturday that a loan scheme would be extended to flood-affected small and medium businesses.

He said the federal government would underwrite 80% of bank loans of up to $5m for small and medium businesses in the flood-affected areas, with repayments to start two years into the loan.

The measure is an extension of a support program available for Covid-affected firms.

“This is about backing the businesses and producers that are backing themselves to get back on their feet,” Morrison said.

The loans are on top of a recovery grants program jointly funded by the federal and NSW governments. Small businesses can get up to $50,000 and primary producers up to $75,000 if they’ve been affected by floods.

As tens of thousands of people across NSW returned to their homes over the weekend, an emergency services taskforce was tackling the cleanup, including Australian defence force personnel, the NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire and Rescue NSW.

The Australian Red Cross warned of a lack of access to mental health help, and urged people affected by the floods to take steps to protect their psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health.

Meanwhile, the search for an elderly woman continued after police pulled her empty car from the swollen Barrington River on Thursday.

Tourists urged to keep NSW Easter plans

Tourism operators hit by recent heavy rain are hoping the upcoming Easter break gives them a much-needed boost.

At the Discovery Park at Forster on the mid-north coast of NSW, which was inundated by this past week’s “rain bomb”, manager Jane Ticehurst said they are gearing up for the holiday.

Ticehurst said she was expecting a full house for the Easter break, which means accommodating about 1,000 guests.

All of this past week’s guests had to be cancelled and rebooked so staff could concentrate on cleaning up after flooding.

The property sits above the Wallamba River, and while some locals said the waterway was at its highest level in memory, the park’s infrastructure escaped relatively undamaged.

Despite some facilities like the boardwalk going under water, Ticehurst said she was feeling fortunate.

“Our team has been impacted in a whole number of ways, from a housekeeper who has lost everything in her property, to most of the team who were landlocked and couldn’t get to work,” Ticehurst said.

“We did have to cancel Easter for everyone last year because of Covid. We’re certainly hoping not to impact Easter this time round.

“The whole of this area has been impacted heavily in the last 18 months, fires followed by Covid and the flooding.

“I guess we can look forward to getting back up and running.”

The NSW Tourism Industry Council executive manager, Greg Binskin, said while some caravan parks along rivers had been hard hit, most operators were pushing ahead with Easter plans.

“[The floods] have been another setback in what’s been a pretty tough 24 months [but] a lot of them are confident they will get cleaned up and ready to be welcoming visitors again,” he said.

He said while the past two years have been tough for operators, domestic tourism has also prompted an uptake in visitors, with international borders still shut.

Binskin said with the jobkeeper wage subsidy ending, programs like the NSW government’s Dine and Discover hospitality voucher scheme – which gives patrons money towards meals and entertainment – would help businesses get back on their feet.

The tourism boss urged people to continue with their Easter plans.

“It’s always a great extended long weekend. We’d urge people to continue to head into regional areas and support your fellow Aussies,” he said."

Prior to urban development, undeveloped land is composed primarily of “pervious surfaces”, such as bushland and grassy fields.
A city with good water-sensitive urban design is one that is designed for rainwater to be captured, slowed, reused and percolated into the ground.
In this way, appropriate urban design can enable further urban development while not exacerbating already serious flood risks.
Whatever the future has in store for western Sydney, the future residents will be better served by water-sensitive urban design than by the catastrophe of another impervious concrete jungle.","future, increased, design, floods, water, river, pervious, flood, warragamba, australia, khan, surfaces, nepean, spill, stuart, development, worse, urban",floods,Acute climatological event (flood),"Around 70,000 people currently live on the Hawkesbury Nepean floodplain. The need to protect these residents and their properties is the reason why these floods require an emergency response.

If people were relocated from the floodplain, such floods would be witnessed as little more than the natural phenomena that have occurred here for millions of years. Floods replenish floodplains with nutrients and groundwater tables with water.

But it is not our plan to relocate people from the floodplain. Instead, the New South Wales government has plans to increase the floodplain population from around 70,000 to 200,000 people by 2050.

If we are intentionally putting people on a notorious floodplain, we will carry a burden of responsibility to protect them as much as we can. This means we must find ways to reduce the frequency of both minor and major flooding events.

Adding an extra 14 metres to the height of the Warragamba Dam wall is an option currently favoured by the NSW government. This would create an additional capacity of around 1,000 gigalitres volume, which could be used to capture large flood events and release them later, once it is safe to do so.

WaterNSW modelling suggests this current event could deliver 1,500GL to Warragamba Dam. In that case, 1,000 GL of storage would help delay a spill for a couple of days, but the inflows would still produce a spill of the last 500GL. Whether that would significantly reduce the peak flood heights on the Hawkesbury-Nepean would depend on whether the delayed spill coincides with peaks from other tributary inflows. It’s all about the timing.

Every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later ... is a flood mitigation success

WaterNSW estimates that only about half the water in the Hawkesbury Nepean system has come from the Warragamba spill. The remainder came from other tributaries, including the upper Nepean River and the Grose River. Effective flood mitigation requires that the timing of any Warragamba spill be such that it does not coincide with peak flows from these sources.

There is another important source of water to the river, which might easily be overlooked, and for which timing is also very important. This is the urban runoff from highly built-up areas such as Penrith. Like spills from Warragamba, the timing of urban runoff will determine the significance of these flows in contributing to flood peaks.

Areas with lots of impervious surfaces, such as roofs, roads and footpaths, convert rainfall into runoff very rapidly and efficiently. This runoff drains to urban stormwater systems, which deliver the water to local waterways. In western Sydney, these local waterways include the Hawkesbury Nepean River and other tributaries that run into it, such as South Creek and Eastern Creek.

Prior to urban development, undeveloped land is composed primarily of “pervious surfaces”, such as bushland and grassy fields. Being “pervious” means water drains down through the soil and into the groundwater table. Water moves underground and much of this groundwater might eventually make its way to Hawkesbury Nepean River. However, it will do so very slowly, arriving gradually and long after the flood peak has passed.

As urban density increases, the proportion of impervious surfaces also increases. This means stormwater will be more rapidly generated and quickly transferred to waterways. By increasing urban density in western Sydney, we could easily further exacerbate the flood risks for the region.

The good news is that there are steps we can take to design our urban environment in a way that minimises the impacts of impervious surfaces. This is often referred to as “water sensitive urban design” and the advantages can extend well beyond flood mitigation.

A city with good water-sensitive urban design is one that is designed for rainwater to be captured, slowed, reused and percolated into the ground. Plentiful pervious surfaces are essential, including back yards, gardens, verges and parklands. With new technologies, even footpaths and driveways can now be made from relatively pervious materials.

Runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed toward the available pervious surfaces to maximise infiltration opportunity. Since infiltration rates are limited, storage is required to hold water until more infiltration capacity becomes available. Storage can be provided by household rainwater tanks, as well as wetlands, lagoons and ponds.

In a large rainfall event, every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later or infiltrate to groundwater is a flood mitigation success. In this way, appropriate urban design can enable further urban development while not exacerbating already serious flood risks.

In times of drought, cities that incorporate water sensitive urban design contribute by maximising the beneficial use of rainwater, thus reducing demand on limited drinking water supplies. Furthermore, water-sensitive cities tend to be highly liveable cities, with plentiful green space and parkland for recreation.

Whatever the future has in store for western Sydney, the future residents will be better served by water-sensitive urban design than by the catastrophe of another impervious concrete jungle."

Perhaps most unnerving were reports of swarms of spiders, seeking refuge on raised trees, fences and in homes across the Mid North Coast of state of New South Wales (NSW). Social media posts showed thousands of spiders fleeing flood waters which had forced them from their usual hiding places.

Professional snake catcher Stuart Johnson from Reptile Solutions in Port Macquarie, told Xinhua that the dramatic rise in water levels had likely prompted all sorts of wildlife out of hiding. ""I've had a few calls for snakes that have found their way up on verandas and into sheds and things like that in properties that have been affected just sort of seeking refuge,"" he said.

Australia's mid-north coast has just over 20 species of snakes, many of which are venomous, including the notorious brown snake and red-bellied black snake. However, a good number of the snakes seen during the floods posed no risk to humans and were simply looking to curl up out of sight and wait for conditions to improve.

Despite being trained and equipped to handle snakes, Mr Johnson said that with floodwaters blocking roads and cutting off properties he had been forced to consult remotely based on photos of the reptiles. In most case, his advice is to steer clear of the snake, block its access to the rest of the property, and wait for it to move on.

Mr Johnson warned that when residents begin the job of cleaning up and shifting debris, they may encounter snakes and other wildlife either trapped or seeking refuge within.

""In these unique situations those animals are quite likely to be distressed, injured and that can potentially increase the chances of them acting defensively where a bite or a sting can occur,"" he said."

Authorities in Nashville, Tenn., said four people were killed and 130 rescued after near-record levels of rainfall caused significant flooding across the region.

The Nashville Office of Emergency Management said in a Sunday morning update that emergency responders were continuing to make rescues in the aftermath of the storm, which drenched the area in a total of 7 inches of rain.

""Even though it looks beautiful outside, we still want people to be cautious and stay aware, stay alert, stay alive,"" Nashville Fire Department Director William Swann said at an early afternoon press conference.

The downpour had subsided in most of Middle Tennessee as of midday Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville. But parts of the region remain under a flash flood watch through the evening and officials are asking the public to stay vigilant as rising creeks and rivers pose a continuing flood risk.

""Continue to avoid flooded roadways and refrain from swimming or walking through flood waters,"" the agency said in a Facebook post. ""Not only could you be unexpectedly swept away, but that water could contain chemicals and sewage.""

Some 1,700 customers remain without power as of early Sunday afternoon, down from 4,600 earlier in the morning, Nashville Mayor John Cooper said. He added that first responders are still asking residents to avoid certain areas, and road closures and other conditions can be monitored on an emergency response website.

The Metro Nashville Police Department said they have found the remains of four people believed to have been killed in the floods. One man was recovered from a sedan submerged by water overflowing from a creek; a second man was found deceased on a golf course and is believed to have been ""swept away by high waters after getting out of a car that ran off the road into a culvert.""

Police later said they had discovered the bodies of a man and a woman near a homeless camp, in a wooded area that was impacted by flooding from a nearby creek.

At the press conference, Nashville Police Chief John Drake attributed three of those deaths to flooding from Seven Mile Creek and provided the ages of the confirmed victims. He said the man submerged in his vehicle was 70 years old, the man at the golf course was 65, and the victims at the homeless encampment were a 46-year-old woman and 64-year-old man.

Drake also noted that one officer is in the hospital recovering from injuries after being swept away by currents during an attempted water rescue. He said the officer managed to get out of his car and cling to a tree until help arrived, and that a citizen who had tried to provide aid was also stranded in the process.

""We're not out of the woods yet,"" Drake warned at the briefing. ""This is still ongoing. Although the water may not be as eventful today, we still have to pay attention to it.""

The mayor also said that the Cumberland River was expected to reach its flood stage of 40 feet around 1 p.m. central time, and hit its peak of 41.9 feet just after midnight. The Harpeth River passed its 20-foot flood stage early Sunday morning and was expected to crest at 27.4 feet around 7 p.m. local time.

The NWS had tweeted earlier in the morning that numerous water rescues were underway across south Nashville, calling the situation life-threatening and citing reports of ""people clinging to trees.""

Just two feet of moving water can sweep a vehicle away, the emergency management office warned. In an update released at 7:30 a.m. local time, it said the Nashville Fire Department had rescued at least 130 people from cars, apartments and houses.

In one instance, authorities said, personnel rescued at least 15 people stranded in a building whose ""structure was compromised due to a mudslide.""

First responders also helped rescue some 40 dogs from Camp Bow Wow, a day care center, and transferred them safely to a nearby facility.

The office of emergency management is working with the American Red Cross to provide shelter for people displaced by the floods, officials said. Cooper said at the press briefing that first responders were walking creek beds and working with the Red Cross to canvass affected neighborhoods.

""As always, Nashvillians help one another during difficult times. This is no exception,"" Cooper said. ""And please mask up, reach out and lend your neighbors a helping hand.""

In hard-hit Rutherford County, the sheriff's office said Sunday morning that it was responding to reports of water rescues and people driving on water-covered roads, and urged people not to remove warning signs or caution tape.

Forty-nine roads are completely closed, 35 are partially closed and 12 have been reopened, according to an online dashboard updated by the county.

Nashville-area residents took to social media to share photos and videos of flooded roads, submerged vehicles and cleanup efforts getting underway on Sunday.

Officials are drawing comparisons to the historic flooding in Nashville and the surrounding area that killed at least 29 people and displaced thousands in May 2010.

""The rainfall we got yesterday and overnight made this one of wettest 24-hour periods in Nashville's history,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Sam Shamburger told the Tennessean. ""It's the worst flooding event we've seen since the May 2010 flood. But the main difference is this event affected a much smaller area than the 2010 flood.""

The NWS said early Sunday that Nashville's two-day rainfall total of 6.69 inches constitutes the second largest in its history, surpassing a previous record set in September 1979 and coming in behind the 13.57 inches recorded on May 1-2, 2010.

The Harpeth River is forecast to rise to 34.8 feet on Sunday night, the agency added, which would be the third-highest stage on record. Aerial photos taken by the Franklin Fire Department around 11:30 a.m. local time show the river already starting to overflow.

Scott Potter, the director of Metro Water Services, said at the briefing that water facilities were safe and he is unconcerned about the effect of the rising river levels, citing predicted peaks that are lower than those in May 2010 and improvements that the facilities have made since then.

The mayor also noted that lessons from the 2010 flood helped the city prepare for an ""improved flood response"" in the form of well-trained swift water rescue teams and better real-time information sharing between metro departments."

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the downpour across the state, Australia's most populous with 8 million people, was worse than initially expected, especially for low-lying areas in Sydney's northwest.

""Yesterday, we were hoping it will only be a one-in-20-year event, now it looks like a one-in-50-year event,"" Berejiklian said at a televised briefing.

People in parts of Sydney's northwest were ordered to flee their houses in the middle of the night as fast-moving waters caused widespread destruction. Late on Sunday, about another 1,000 people were asked to evacuate, after Berejiklian said that some 4,000 people may be asked to leave their houses.

Television and social media footage showed fast-moving water unmooring houses, engulfing roads, breaking trees and damaging road infrastructure. Emergency services estimate the total number of damaged houses to be ""in the hundreds.""

Several major roads were closed across the state while many schools called off classes for Monday.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a Facebook post announced federal financial assistance for those affected.

The flooding comes in stark contrast with the devastating bushfires that struck Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, when nearly 7% of NSW land was scorched.

Flooding risk and evacuation warnings were in place for about 13 areas in NSW, including the Hunter, one of Australia's major wine regions.

Several dams, including Warragamba, Sydney’s main water supply, spilled over causing river levels to surge.

Meteorologists said the downpour is set to continue for several days. Emergency crews have responded to about 6,000 calls for help since the start of the rains on Thursday, including nearly 700 direct pleas for rescue from floods.

The extreme weather has also affected Australia's COVID-19 vaccine delivery to across NSW, disrupting the country's plans to deliver the first doses to almost 6 million people over the next few weeks.

On Sunday, Australia's medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), granted approval for locally produced AstraZeneca vaccines.

RIGA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Latvian armed forces on Thursday blew up a huge ice congestion in one of the Baltic country's largest rivers that had threatened to cause major floods in the area.

The ice blasting operation was announced after the ice jam near the central Latvian municipality of Carnikava caused water levels in the River Gauja to rise dangerously this week.

On Wednesday, the swelling river had already inundated nearby meadows and some local residents reported that it had flooded their garages.

Lieutenant Colonel Edmunds Svencs said on public radio Thursday that soldiers drilled around 200 holes in the ice and placed a kilogram of explosives in each hole.

At around 3 p.m., ice started to move in the river, with the sludge floating right towards the explosives. ""The preparation works were finished. As we were told that the ice was moving, we decided to detonate the explosives 7-8 minutes earlier than planned to make way for the approaching sludge,"" Svencs said.

The ice jam was blown up successfully, and by 6 p.m. the stream was running freely, according to Carnikava authorities. Enditem"
