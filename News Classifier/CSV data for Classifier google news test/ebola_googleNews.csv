A doctor who helped discover the Ebola virus disease has warned that many dangerous diseases are on the verge of spreading which could be as transmitted as rapidly as the coronavirus and be as deadly as the Ebola virus. Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum from Congo spoke with CNN recently and revealed how a number of new viruses are being expected to come to light in an act which he describes as “a threat for humanity”. The microbiologist who helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976, says these viruses emerging from the tropical forests of Africa could rapidly spread and soon grow deadly for the human population.

""We are now in a world where new pathogens will come out,"" he further told the publication. He also said that he thinks that any new disease could become more apocalyptic than COVID-19.

This scientific warning has been given after a woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo has shown early symptoms of hemorrhagic fever. While she has been tested for Ebola, researchers fear if she is the patient zero of the hypothetical Disease X which spreads faster than COVID and has Ebola's 50 to 90 per cent fatality rate.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a Disease X is the possibility of an international epidemic that can spread from a pathogen unknown to humankind. The disease has been included in the list of priority diseases by the health body and experts opine that it is important we stay alert and fear the breakout of any new pathogen.

As seen in the case of the woman, where she tested negative for several other diseases with similar symptoms, Muyembe expects many more zoonotic diseases to come out in the future.

Zoonotic diseases like yellow fever, rabies, brucellosis and Lyme disease spread from animals to human beings and have caused epidemics and pandemics before. While the deadly HIV emerged from a type of Chimpanzee and then mutated into a fatal disease, SARS-CoV-2, along with SARS, and MERS are all coronaviruses that have suddenly jumped from animals to humans.

So the scary possibility of many more such zoonotic diseases attacking humanity is a valid one."

Muyembe, according to CNN, has warned many more zoonotic diseases, or those that jump from animals to humans, could arise. Covid-19 is among those diseases, along with yellow fever and rabies, thought to have emerged from an unknown reservoir or the term used to indicate a virus’ natural host in the animal kingdom.

Muyembe runs the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa, which is supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO and its labs are the world’s early warning system for new outbreaks of known diseases like Ebola, and -- perhaps more importantly -- for those illnesses scientists are yet to discover. “If a pathogen emerged from Africa it will take time to spread all over the world. So, if this virus is detected early -- like in my institution here -- there will be opportunity for Europe [and the rest of the world] to develop new strategies to fight these new pathogens,” Muyembe told CNN.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, is suspected to have originated in China and possibly from bats. Experts have largely attributed the outbreak of zoonotic diseases to the deforestation which sees animals’ natural habitats disappear.

The coronavirus disease has affected 85 million people, of which 1,843,143 have died, across the world, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker. India, the second worst-hit country after the United States, has 10,340,469 infections and its death toll stands at 149,649."

JANET SCOTT

Asubstantial proportion of people who survive Ebola may produce a spike in antibody levels more than six months after they’ve recovered from the disease, according to a study published today (January 27) in Nature.

Analyzing multiple plasma samples from 51 survivors of the West African outbreak of 2013–2016, researchers found that the levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies declined, as expected, in the days and weeks following recovery. But these levels shot up again in some survivors around the 200- to 300-day mark before declining again—evidence that Ebola virus may be lingering inside their bodies and re-emerging to trigger immune defenses, the researchers conclude in their paper.

“The idea that there can be a source of virus that could restimulate the immune system isn’t surprising” in itself, says Carl Davis, an immunologist at Emory University who was not involved in the work. “But the fact that they were seeing this so frequently and to such a big magnitude is really pretty shocking.”

Clinicians should be aware that this phenomenon can occur. —Bill Paxton, University of Liverpool

Since the West African epidemic, which claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people, there have been multiple reports of viral persistence in survivors. One 2016 study, for example, reported that 24 of 429 men in Liberia who had been infected with Ebola tested positive for viral RNA in their semen more than 12 months after they’d recovered from the disease, with one testing positive more than a year and a half after completing treatment. Viral RNA isn’t necessarily evidence of infectious virus, but based on genomic and epidemiological data, researchers suspect that Ebola can be transmitted sexually by men several months after infection.

Taking a different approach, University of Liverpool virologists Georgios Pollakis, Bill Paxton, and colleagues focused in the current study on measuring survivors’ immune responses to Ebola virus. Specifically, they analyzed the levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies in 115 healthy people in Sierra Leone who had recovered from prior infections and had volunteered to provide convalescent plasma to be used as an experimental therapy for other patients.

Using a combination of immunological assays, including treating some of the plasma samples with synthetic viral particles bearing specific Ebola virus proteins, the researchers monitored antibody levels between 30 and 500 days after participants were discharged from Ebola treatment units. Among the 51 participants who provided more than one sample, the researchers found that, on the whole, antibody levels seemed to decline following a person’s recovery, as expected. However, in more than half of those participants, the team detected an increase in antibody levels between about six months and a year post-recovery.

One of many displays raising public awareness in Freetown, Sierra Leone GEORGIOS POLLAKIS

Such an antibody spike is unlikely to be the result of people receiving Ebola vaccinations during the study, Pollakis says. Plasma donors reported to clinicians that they hadn’t received vaccines. If they had been immunized, the researchers would have expected to see increased levels of antibodies only against the proteins used in the vaccine; instead, their assays revealed increased levels of antibodies against various viral proteins.

Nor is the observation likely to be due to survivors being reinfected by other people, Pollakis adds. The samples were negative for viral RNA, and some of the observed antibody increases occurred after Sierra Leone had stopped reporting new Ebola cases, he explains.

Instead, the researchers hypothesize that the spike is the result of the immune system re-encountering viral antigens already within the body. This could happen if Ebola virus hides in so-called immune-privileged sites such as the eye, the reproductive tract, or the central nervous system—those regions typically better shielded from the immune system than other areas of the body—and then reappears once antibody levels have fallen below a certain threshold.

The findings suggest “that actually, a much larger proportion of individuals than were previously thought carry some form of viral antigens, if not the whole virus,” Pollakis says, “and that as the antibodies decline and reach a nadir around two hundred, two hundred and fifty days, the antigen gets the chance to come back in some form and stimulate the immune system again.”

Nathalie MacDermott, an academic clinical lecturer at King’s College London who participated in the medical response to Ebola in West Africa and was not involved in the study, says that the findings seem to confirm something that has long been suggested by other investigations of Ebola survivors, although “the sample size is relatively small.” She adds that it will be important to understand what makes some people more susceptible to a recurrence of the virus than others, and to gather more detailed data on how long recurrent virus may stick around in survivors once it’s reappeared.

In more than half of those participants, the team detected an increase in antibody levels between about six months and a year post-recovery.

Davis, who coauthored a 2019 study of B cell responses to Ebola in four survivors treated in the US, notes that it would be interesting to see if the same antibody patterns are present in a more diverse patient population. People selected as potential plasma donors might not be representative of all Ebola survivors—for instance, the authors speculate in their paper that donors are less likely to have viral recurrence, because they have to be healthy to take part in the study and therefore should be better at suppressing Ebola virus than the general population of survivors. But Davis notes that this relationship hasn't been demonstrated. He adds that further work could investigate immune-cell responses in addition to the antibody levels measurable in plasma samples.

Pollakis tells The Scientist that the team wants to encourage vaccination programs for Ebola survivors, which would allow researchers to study immune responses in a more controlled and in-depth way, as well as boost immune protection in these patients. MacDermott notes that it would be important to work out whether recurrent virus in an individual is likely to be transmissible to others or likely to cause symptomatic illness in the survivor when considering the costs and benefits of vaccination.

Paxton says that survivors of the outbreak should be monitored as a precaution against viral re-emergence as time increases since the West African epidemic and antibody levels keep decreasing in the population. “Clinicians should be aware that this phenomenon can occur,” he says. Although it’s unknown if viral recurrence in individuals could result in transmission to other people, those individuals at least may benefit from treatment, he adds. “You need good clinical surveillance and clinical management.”

INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CORPS’ RESPONSE

During the 11th outbreak, International Medical Corps’ Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) managed more than 900 patients at Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) in Bikoro, Mbandaka and Buburu, including 29 confirmed cases.

On June 30, when the Mangina ETC in the northeast was decommissioned, the facility had cared for 3,859 suspected and 422 confirmed Ebola patients.

International Medical Corps is providing infection prevention and control (IPC) support to 196 health facilities to ensure that healthcare delivery is safe, including 20 new facilities in Équateur.

Since August 21, 2018, screening and referral units (SRUs) supported by International Medical Corps have provided more than 2 million screenings for Ebola and 1.2 million screenings for COVID-19.

COVID-19 Response in the DRC

DRC follows the global trend of rising COVID-19 cases, indicating the existence of a second wave of the virus though although no cases of the new variant, which is believed to have originated in South Africa, have been observed in the DRC. In December 2020, the country recorded the highest number of new infections in a single month (4,841) since the beginning of the pandemic, more than triple the number of cases reported in November. The total number of infections currently stands at 17,700 cases.

In light of these developments, the DRC government has reinforced control measures to limit the spread of the virus, such as instituting a nighttime curfew between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m., mandatory wearing of masks in public spaces and limiting the number of participants in training sessions and workshops to 10. International Medical Corps continued to strengthen the Ministry of Health’s capacity to screen, isolate and manage suspect and confirmed cases at health facilities by training health staff and providing mentorship and coaching, and to reduce the risk of infection among frontline health workers.

International Medical Corps also continues to implement community awareness and sensitization activities via radio spots, bulk SMSs and mobile caravans. Thanks to a donation of masks from MiMask, we were able to distribute this key element of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline health workers in Munzenze prison and four other health facilities in Goma."

Development of the Ebola vaccine was expedited following the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa, which left more than 11,300 dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
COVID-19Gavi chief executive Seth Berkley said the Ebola vaccine had “set a precedent for fast-tracking development and production of vaccines against COVID-19”.
“By creating a stockpile of 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine, available to all countries, we can help prevent loss of life and swiftly end Ebola outbreaks in the future,” Berkley added.
A spokesman for MSD said the company was working closely with the WHO on replenishment and supply of the vaccine.","vaccine, delays, international, ebola, supply, doses, 500000, countries, planned, available, vaccines, stockpile, chain, hit",ebola,pandemic,"Supply chain delays must be addressed to speed up creation of a stockpile of vaccines against deadly Ebola disease, researchers say.

Once it is fully operational, low and lower middle-income countries will be able to access the stockpile of 500,000 doses free of charge along with support for operational costs for the rollout of immunisation programmes, the vaccine alliance Gavi and partners announced Tuesday.

However, international organisations warned it could take up to three years to reach the target.

“By creating a stockpile of 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine, available to all countries, we can help prevent loss of life and swiftly end Ebola outbreaks in the future,” Gavi CEO Seth Berkley

The new Ebola vaccine was used to tackle a two-year long outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which was declared over last June after 300,000 people were immunised.

The injectable Ervebo vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP), manufactured by Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) Corp., is effective against the most common Zaire strain of the virus. It has been approved by eight African countries following a fast-tracked prequalification process by the World Health Organization (WHO), certifying its safety and efficacy.

The stockpile will include licensed doses of Ervebo, which has also been approved by European and US regulators, said Gavi, as well as other candidate vaccines in the pipeline once licensed.

The stockpile will be housed in Basel, Switzerland, and managed by an international coordinating organisation, comprising UN agencies the WHO and UNICEF, and aid agencies Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

On request from a country, vaccines can be made available together with ultra-cold chain packaging by the manufacturer for emergency response shipment, the WHO said.

However, MSF warned that there were currently only 6,890 doses available because of “supply bottlenecks” and said it could take up to three years for the 500,000 target to be met. The WHO also said it could take two to three years.

David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The challenge for the Ebola stockpile is to have enough vaccine immediately ready to roll out – hopefully there will be more vaccines to add to the stockpile in the future.”

He stressed that the vaccine was only licensed for the Zaire Ebola strain and may not work effectively for other strains.

The first deliveries of doses into the stockpile are being funded through a US$20 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Since Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare and unpredictable, there is no natural market for the vaccine, the WHO explained.

Gavi said it had created “strong incentives” for vaccine manufacturers through an advance purchasing commitment to procure doses once they were prequalified by the WHO.

Development of the Ebola vaccine was expedited following the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa, which left more than 11,300 dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Guyguy Manangama, head of the Ebola response at MSF, who worked on the last Ebola outbreak in the DRC, said vaccination was one of the most effective ways of fighting Ebola epidemics and the stockpile would allow rapid deployment in endemic areas, but added it “should not limit efforts for the development of other vaccine candidates”.

“It will be necessary to ensure a good system of replenishment of this stock so as not to deal with disruptions on the ground at critical times of epidemics, to continue research in order to improve and adapt the cold chain according to the context, so that to have a more stable vaccine that does not require a complex cold chain,” he said.

COVID-19

Gavi chief executive Seth Berkley said the Ebola vaccine had “set a precedent for fast-tracking development and production of vaccines against COVID-19”.

Gavi is also jointly leading the COVAX programme with the WHO, aimed at procuring and ensuring equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

“By creating a stockpile of 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine, available to all countries, we can help prevent loss of life and swiftly end Ebola outbreaks in the future,” Berkley added.

Marianne Comparet, director of the London-based International Society for Neglected Tropical Diseases, was optimistic, despite the time it will take to reach the full stockpile.

“The fact that such major organisations have partnered together on this will ensure accelerated scrutiny, at the highest level and in-field, of the supply-chain bottlenecks,” she said.

A spokesman for MSD said the company was working closely with the WHO on replenishment and supply of the vaccine.

“We are moving swiftly to manufacture licensed doses of Ervebo, and this can take appropriate time. In the interim, we have been committed to continuing to provide investigational doses for outbreak response,” he said."

The global stockpile will provide developing countries responding to Ebola outbreaks with doses of the approved single-dose Ebola vaccine, rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP, live, free of charge.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has funded an emergency stockpile of 500,000 doses of Ebola vaccine, which will be available to all countries for outbreak response following procurement. Gavi-eligible low- and lower middle-income countries will be able to access the stockpile free of charge and will receive support for operational costs to conduct outbreak response immunisation activities.

According to the alliance, it supported the establishment of the Ebola vaccine stockpile prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to strengthen the world’s defences against the threat of devastating infectious disease outbreaks. Through the Advance Purchase Commitment (APC), its innovative financing mechanism, Gavi created strong incentives for manufacturers to accelerate their Ebola vaccine developments. Essentially the alliance committed to procure doses once a safe and effective vaccine was prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO).

This APC also ensured that doses of the investigational vaccine could be deployed on a compassionate use basis during outbreaks, prior to the vaccine being licensed. This has so far helped end the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with over 300,000 people vaccinated against the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighbouring countries.

“This is a true success story for the Vaccine Alliance that illustrates the strength of our public-private partnership. The accelerated development of the Ebola vaccine was possible thanks to a first-of-its-kind agreement between Gavi and the vaccine manufacturer, which set a precedent for fast-tracking development and production of vaccines against COVID-19,” said Gavi Chief Executive Officer, Dr Seth Berkley. “By creating a stockpile of 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine, available to all countries, we can help prevent loss of life and swiftly end Ebola outbreaks in the future.”

The stockpile will include licensed doses of the single-dose Ebola vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP, live) manufactured by MSD, which has received approval from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in addition to prequalification from WHO. The first deliveries of doses into the stockpile are being funded through a $20 million contribution from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Decisions on vaccine allocations from the stockpile will be made by an International Coordinating Group (ICG) comprising WHO, UNICEF, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

“The stockpile of thousands of Ebola vaccines is a ground-breaking development,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “It is testimony to the unrelenting and unprecedented efforts of this global partnership to fight Ebola outbreaks – and it provides an opportunity to learn from this success as we prepare for the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.”

There are currently several other candidate vaccines for Ebola virus disease (EVD) at different phases of development that may be eligible for eventual inclusion into the stockpile once they have received WHO prequalification."

The Ebola outbreak in the northeast of the DRC, the country’s 10th and second-largest in world history, claimed the lives of 2,287 of the 3,324 patients affected. The 11th outbreak, in Équateur Province, affected 13 of the province’s 18 health zones, with 130 confirmed cases and 55 deaths.

372,848 people have been vaccinated against Ebola (including 39,859 in Équateur province).

INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CORPS’ RESPONSE

During the 11th Ebola outbreak, International Medical Corps’ Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) managed more than 900 patients at Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) in Bikoro, Mbandaka and Buburu, including 29 confirmed cases.

On June 30, when the Mangina ETC in the northeast was decommissioned, the facility had cared for 3,859 suspected and 422 confirmed Ebola patients.

International Medical Corps is providing infection prevention and control (IPC) support to 196 health facilities to ensure that healthcare delivery is safe, including 20 new facilities in Équateur province.

Since August 21, 2018, screening and referral units (SRUs) supported by International Medical Corps have provided more than 2 million screenings for Ebola and 1.2 million screenings for COVID-19.

Support for COVID-19 Vaccine Preparedness in the DRC

Disease outbreaks are common in the DRC, including diseases of international concern, such as Ebola and COVID-19. The introduction of an Ebola vaccine in the DRC in 2018 enabled the country to mitigate the impact of the last three outbreaks. Based on this experience, the DRC government hopes to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the country through the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.

To promote this goal, the DRC has been enrolled by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization—now known as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—in COVAX, a global initiative that seeks to enable equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly by middle- and low-income countries. With the reception and roll out of these vaccines scheduled to begin during the first quarter of 2021, preparedness activities are being coordinated by a national multisectoral committee.

Among the needs for the vaccine rollout are support for information and promotion campaigns, cold-chain management, logistics, waste management and immunization surveillance. Vaccination efforts will prioritize high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and other frontline staff, people living with co-morbidities and the elderly. In February, International Medical Corps will begin conducting community consultations in four provinces of the DRC to identify community perception and misinformation about potential COVID-19 vaccines, which we will document and share with the Ministry of Health. These findings will inform a national workshop to develop a community engagement and communication plan that will support the rollout of the vaccine. With additional donor support, International Medical Corps looks forward to supporting the DRC government with other aspects of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout."

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigators created their guidelines based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) after the vaccine received US Food and Drug Administration approval on Dec. 19, 2019.

The CDC recommendations also noted that 11 persons infected with Ebola have been treated in the US All of those cases were associated with the 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa, and 8 of those were responding to an outbreak.

Persons who are responding to an Ebola outbreak are among what the CDC is categorizing as the population with the highest risk for potential occupational exposure to the infection. Additionally, health care personnel at any of the US’s 11 federally designated Ebola treatment centers as well as laboratorians and other staff at any of the 8 biosafety level 4 facilities in the U.S. that handle replication-competent Ebola virus are vulnerable. In all, about 900 health care personnel, laboratorians, and staff work at those such facilities.

The CDC said that ACIP will discuss and consider additional populations for vaccine candidacy in the future. However, vaccination of a pregnant women should involve consideration of the patient’s risk for exposure to Ebola. There is no data yet on the Ervebo’s effect on breast milk production, presence in breast milk, or on the breast-fed child.

Additionally, persons with a history of severe allergic reaction should not receive Ervebo, the CDC said. It should also not be taken by persons allergic to rice, as the vaccine contains a rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin.

Further research will be conducted regarding the Ervebo for immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, and children, the CDC said.

Vaccine efficacy was judged to be 100 percent in the initial study for participants who received immediate vaccination. In a follow-up study, the efficacy was again judged to be 100 percent. There were 3 types of joint-related adverse events post-vaccination (vaccine-related arthralgia, severe arthralgia, and vaccine-related arthritis).

The most common adverse reactions to the vaccine were injection site pain, swelling, and redness. Headaches, fever, muscle pain, fatigue, joint pain, nausea, arthritis, rash, and abnormal sweating were also reported.

While Ervebo is not commercially available, the vaccine is made available to US civilians for free through the government according to ACIP recommendations after receipt of request, the CDC said.

Ervebo is administered as a single intramuscular 1 mL dose under the supervision of a physician. The CDC also suggested that the injection site be the deltoid area of the nondominant arm. It is designed to be administered immediately after thawing from frozen (it is frozen for long-term storage).

Following vaccination, a person may still test positive for Ebola glycoprotein. That being said, diagnostic testing for Ebola in a vaccinated person should include nonglycoprotein targets, the CDC recommended.

It is not currently known how long protections from Ervebo last, the CDC noted. The agency also said that vaccination with Ervebo may not protect all persons. Those who are vaccinated should continue to adhere to infection control practices, they said."

Not only would they have to develop and test an Ebola vaccine (something that had never been done), but there was the problem of distribution.

The deadly virus had reached villages with no power and no access beyond narrow dirt roads that would be impassable in the rainy season.

The vaccine they planned to use would have to be kept very cold: about -80 degrees Celsius, or four times more chilly than a household freezer.

They would have to find a way to safely store the vaccine for up to a week without electricity.

And they had three months to find a solution.

In the end, they invented what is essentially a giant space-age thermos that can maintain the temperature of an Antarctic winter for weeks on end.

The Arktek is an esky with such good insulation that it could be packed with ice and left in the blazing desert sun for up to a month without dropping a degree.

As Australia prepares to distribute the recently approved Pfizer vaccine at -70C, the story of how these researchers overcame technical obstacles to successfully roll out a vaccine could also hold vital lessons.

Building a better esky

By late 2014, the Ebola situation was dire. Thousands had died in West Africa and the virus had spread to the US and the UK.

But there was some good news: a vaccine would be ready within months.

In December 2014, the World Health Organization asked a company of inventors, Intellectual Ventures (IV), to solve the problem of how to distribute the vaccine without power, while also storing it safely at -80C.

Daniel Lieberman, a mechanical engineer at the company at the time, was part of the team that assembled in a building near Seattle.

""We turned to the Arktek,"" he said.

Intellectual Ventures originally developed the Arktek a few years earlier for the distribution of polio vaccines in places without power in response to a challenge from Bill Gates, who nicknamed the invention ""the keg of life"".

The design uses vacuum barriers, fibreglass and shiny internal coatings to reduce heat transfer between the warm outside and cold inside.

Blocks of ice frozen in semi-circular containers are used for cooling.

""Our design was extremely leak tight,"" Mr Lieberman said.

""And when I say leak tight, I mean thermally leak tight. This is a very, very well insulated device.""

Unfortunately, it was only good for vaccines stored between 2 and 8C.

Having to make it work at -80C was an ""absolutely massive"" problem, Mr Leiberman said.

In December 2014, they set to work. They had until March.

Solving the cooling problem

The researchers focused on finding a better way of cooling the Arktek — what they called a ""thermal battery"".

In the original Arktek, this battery was simply frozen water.

Frozen carbon dioxide or dry ice, which has a surface temperature of -78C, was an option, but there wasn't enough in West Africa to make this work.

Stumped and desperate for a solution, they turned to a relatively obscure class of chemicals called phase-change materials (PCMs). These are synthetic molecules designed to freeze or thaw at specific temperatures.

Experimenting with different ingredients, they found a combination of denatured alcohol and water froze at -75C — good enough for their purposes.

""It turns out that you can create ice packs of almost any temperature you like, you just can't use water, you have to use something else,"" Mr Lieberman said.

Within months, modified Arkteks packed with PCMs were deployed to West Africa.

Between April and December 2015 health workers vaccinated 8,000 people against Ebola.

Three months later, the epidemic was declared over.

Largest roll out of an ultra-cool vaccine in the world

Only two years later, Ebola returned — this time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Central Africa.

Authorities acted fast — cases had been recorded in the city of Mbandaka, not far from the capital of Kinshasa, a city of 14 million.

With 16 Arkteks and a few ultra-cold freezers to supply the PCM cold bricks, health workers inoculated more than 300,000 people in a bit over two years.

When the roads were flooded and cars could not get through, Arkteks were reportedly strapped to canoes or the backs of motor bikes.

The DRC's program, which brought the epidemic to an end, remains the largest rollout of an ultra-cold vaccine, according to GAVI, an alliance of governments, drug companies and charities that arranges global vaccination campaigns.

""The heroic efforts of Congolese vaccinators, logisticians and health workers meant over 300,000 people in the DRC and neighbouring countries consented to and received the vaccine,"" a spokesperson said.

""In an equatorial region with intermittent electricity, poor roads and few health clinics, this could have been an insurmountable challenge.

""[DRC's success] shows it is feasible, at least at this scale, but also hugely complex.""

Esky upgraded for COVID vaccine distribution

With the roll-out of Pfizer's COVID vaccine at -70C, the Arktek may be deployed again.

Mr Lieberman, who is now at the non-profit GH Labs, has modified the device to use dry ice, which he says is a better thermal battery and easy to access in many countries affected by COVID.

""There are many, many, countries that have reliable carbon dioxide, and dry ice mass-production capacity,"" he said.

Pfizer is already using dry ice to transport its ultra-cold vaccines, but its cooler boxes are not as sophisticated as the Arktek, according to Mr Lieberman.

Made from cardboard and foam, Pfizer's 'thermal shippers' can keep doses for 15 days so long as they are refilled with dry ice every five days.

The Arktek, by comparison, lasts up to four weeks between refills, Mr Lieberman said.

""It has a heat leak rate 10 to 15 times less than something like the Pfizer cool box — that kind of rule of magnitude,"" he said.

A backup solution for remote areas in Australia?

Whether the Arktek will be needed for distribution of ultra-cold COVID vaccines in Australia or elsewhere in the world remains to be seen.

Earlier this week, Australia approved the Pfizer vaccine for use, with the first jabs in February.

Distributing the Pfizer vaccine to remote areas will be a challenge — the 'thermal shippers' each hold 5,000 doses that have to be thawed together.

Once thawed, they must be kept in the fridge and used within five days.

If a box was to be unthawed in a small town or community, most of the doses would be wasted.

Health authorities plan to avoid the worst of the logistics problems by only distributing the Pfizer vaccine from 30 to 50 urban and regional hospitals.

The really remote places, such as some communities in the Northern Territory, are more likely to get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be stored in a regular fridge.

Even so, GH Labs is working with GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to look at ways the Arktek could be used to distribute the Pfizer vaccine more broadly.

Mr Lieberman said one idea was using the Arktek as part of a 'hub and spoke' model.

""The Pfizer box would arrive at a central location and then you'd use other tools like the Arktek to distribute more regionally within a country,"" he said.

""Our main goal now is to make sure that the Arktek is up for the challenge, and is ready for countries if and when they need it.""

Some countries have ordered Arkteks for their COVID vaccine roll outs.

Aucma, the Chinese company that manufactures the US$2000 devices, said it would double production this year to meet the higher demand.

Rural Doctors Association Australia President Dr John Hall said the Arktek would ""absolutely"" be useful in the final stage of delivering the Pfizer vaccine to remote areas.

""If there's no backup solution to delivering Pfizer, we could see significant disadvantages for rural and remote Australia,"" he said.

""All it takes is for a major producer to have a fault and we could see delays of weeks or months."""

Ebanga was approved based on its ability to reduce 28-day mortality in patients with confirmed Ebolavirus infection.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Ebanga (Ansuvimab-zykl), a human monoclonal antibody, for the treatment for Zaire ebolavirus (Ebolavirus) infection in adults and children. The approval is based on data from the PALM trial, in which the biologic significantly reduced 28-day mortality.

Ebanga prevents the virus from entering human cells by inhibiting receptor binding.

Zaire ebolavirus is one of four Ebolavirus species that can cause a potentially fatal human disease. Transmitted through blood, body fluids and tissues of infected people or wild animals, as well as by surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids, individuals who care for people with the disease are at the highest risk for infection.

The PALM trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ebanga was conducted during the 2018-2019 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial 174 participants (120 adults and 54 paediatric patients) with confirmed Ebolavirus infection received a single 50 mg/kg infusion of Ebanga and 168 participants (135 adults and 33 paediatric patients) received an investigational control. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day mortality.

Of the 174 patients who received Ebanga, 35.1 percent died after 28 days, compared to 49.4 percent of patients who received a control.

The most common symptoms experienced while receiving Ebanga include: fever, tachycardia, diarrhoea, vomiting, hypotension, tachypnea (fast breathing) and chills; however, these are also common symptoms of Ebolavirus infection. Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related events, can occur and treatment should be discontinued in these instances.

Patients who receive Ebanga should avoid the concurrent administration of a live virus vaccine against Ebolavirus, as the treatment may inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy.

The FDA granted the approval to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, LP."

The woman, identified as Ingende, was tested for several diseases, including Ebola, but they all came out as negative. This sparked fears that her illness may have been caused by the so-called 'Disease X'

""We've all got to be frightened,"" the woman's physician, Dr. Dadin Bonkole, told the US news channel, adding that ""we have to be afraid of new diseases"" as Ebola and COVID-19 were both unknown before.

Meanwhile, Prof. Tamfum also cautioned that many more zoonotic diseases, specifically those that get transmitted from animals to humans, could arise. He stated that diseases, namely influenza, rabies, and yellow fever have all jumped from animals to humans, adding occurrences are common and could lead to epidemics and pandemics in the future."

Costa questioned the impact of reactive, short-term funding responses to health emergencies such as COVID-19 (ref. 1). As an example, they cited the Ebola projects of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and stated that ‘no drugs or licensed vaccines are available to treat or prevent […] Ebola’.

On the suggestion that our Ebola programme is ‘short term’, I would like to highlight the investment made by the IMI of close to €300 million in 12 Ebola projects, half of which have a duration of 5–7 years. The last projects will finish in 2023.

On the availability of a vaccine, European and United States regulators approved the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine at the end of 2019 (refs. 2,3), and the European Commission approved the Janssen Ebola vaccine regimen on 1 July 2020 (ref. 2). IMI, along with other organizations including Bavarian Nordic A/S, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the National Institutes of Health, significantly supported the development of the Janssen vaccine. IMI’s contributions included support for clinical trials in Europe and Africa, as well as support for vaccine manufacture and for compliance and capacity building in Africa to ensure that clinical trials could take place. IMI projects also supported the development of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine by analysing and characterizing the immune response to the vaccine. IMI projects have delivered tools to support the engagement of local communities in clinical trials, such as A Guidebook on Community Engagement, Communications, and Technology for Clinical Trials in Outbreak Settings4, which could also be utilized for other disease areas. Finally, IMI has funded projects to develop rapid diagnostic tests which has resulted in a commercially available, CE-marked, in vitro diagnostic mobile detection platform that can detect whether an individual has Ebola (or a related disease such as Marburg virus) within 75 minutes. It can be used with only limited training and is designed to work in sites where high-end laboratory infrastructures are not available5.

IMI’s Ebola projects were launched extremely rapidly, and this experience helped us to quickly launch projects to develop treatments and rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19. A call for proposals launched on 3 March 2020 resulted in eight projects (three on treatments and five on diagnostics), with a total budget of €116 million coming from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, pharmaceutical companies’ in-kind donations and other contributions6. As with our Ebola projects, this is no short-term investment — our portfolio includes projects with durations of 4–5 years, and while the focus is obviously on the current COVID-19 outbreak, a number of the projects’ results will also be relevant for future outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses.

More broadly, some of IMI’s other projects have applied their knowledge, skills and resources to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, IMI’s EHDEN and ConcePTION projects and the ADVANCE/VAC4EU initiative will help the European Medicines Agency gather real-world data on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments once they are approved and used in day-to-day clinical practice7.

Elsewhere, IMI’s COMBACTE projects have created a pan-European network of 975 hospitals and 800 laboratories for clinical studies and trials on antimicrobial resistance. Scientists are now turning to the networks to identify sites for clinical trials of potential COVID-19 treatments8.

In conclusion, I agree that research funders have a responsibility to fund projects that will have an impact on health. However, it is incorrect to suggest that the funds made available by IMI (and others) in the wake of the West African Ebola outbreak have not made a difference. Thanks to the long-term investments of a wide range of funders, the world is now much better placed to prevent and deal with an Ebola outbreak. Moreover, the experience of responding to the Ebola outbreak has helped to shape our response to the current coronavirus pandemic.

The scientist who discovered the Ebola virus warned the same!

A potentially active virus might be originating from the African tropical forest and might hit humans soon, says Professor Jean Jacques who discovered the Ebola virus back in 1976. He warns that the development of new pathogens can trigger more deadly diseases in humans and thus, humanity is in danger. With a total number of corona affected cases crossing the mark of 85 million worldwide, humanity is “actually” in danger if such viruses keep evolving like this.

Disease X going to bring more threat to humanity

As termed by the scientists, the disease X, where X stands for a hypothetical unexpected pathogen that may be more potential even than the coronavirus. Its fatality rate matches 50% to 90% of Ebola whereas it can spread massively like the coronavirus. The scientist who discovered Ebola, Jean Jacques says, “We are now in a world where new pathogens will come out. And that’s what constitutes a threat for humanity”. He also said that the new disease can be more “apocalyptic” than the coronavirus.

Ebola scientist says more zoonotic disease to grab us soon

A zoonotic disease is one that spreads from animals to humans. The coronavirus is also expected to be a disease of this kind as it is expected to have spread from bats of Chinese origin. Most experts are seeing this zoonotic disease outbreak as the result of massive deforestation that is carried out globally which destroys the animal’s natural habitat. When nature comes to take revenge, it doesn’t leave any stone unturned to protect itself from cruelty. So, we must take care of the nature and environment and also protect the natural habitat of animals to prevent such deadly occurrences.

Early detection can control the spread unlike the coronavirus

Even though the potentiality of the virus is more and it can affect more humans if it starts spreading like corona, it is also a fact that controlling it in the initial stage may not make the condition so worse. Regarding the same, Jean Jacques said, “If a pathogen emerged from Africa it would take time to spread all over the world. So, if this virus is detected early — like in my institution here — there will be an opportunity for Europe [and the rest of the world] to develop new strategies to fight these new pathogens”. We only hope for a better future ahead.

The Policy Times suggestion

If the report is to be believed then the world is in real danger. Even if we keep facing these new challenges every day, we must not lose hope. We must still keep our faith strong and move ahead with the goal of fighting the adversities positively.

The governing authorities of all the nations must also look out to the fact that what preventive measures can be taken if there is any truth to the new virus originating reports. The earlier we take prevention, the better we will be able to deal with the worse.

It reported Guinea would contact the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health agencies to acquire Ebola vaccines.
‘Huge concern’Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, said the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea was a “huge concern”.

Guinea has declared an Ebola epidemic after three people died and four others became ill in the country’s southeast.

The seven people fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending a burial in Goueke, near the Liberian border. The infected patients have been isolated in treatment centres, the health ministry said on Sunday.

“Faced with this situation and in accordance with international health regulations, the Guinean government declares an Ebola epidemic,” the ministry said in a statement.

Health Minister Remy Lamah said officials were “really concerned” about the deaths, the first since a 2013-2016 epidemic – which began in Guinea – left 11,300 dead across West Africa. The vast majority of cases were in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

A second round of tests is being carried out to confirm the latest Ebola diagnosis and health workers are working to trace and isolate the contacts of the cases, state health agency ANSS said.

It reported Guinea would contact the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health agencies to acquire Ebola vaccines. The vaccines have greatly improved survival rates in recent years.





‘Huge concern’

Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, said the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea was a “huge concern”.

“Health teams in Guinea are on the move to quickly trace the path of the virus and curb further infections,” she said. “WHO is supporting the authorities to set up testing, contact-tracing and treatment structures and to bring the overall response to full speed.”

Speaking to Al Jazeera from the Guinean capital, Conakry, Dr Yuma Taido – of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – said it was not clear how people had come into contact with the virus.

“We are preparing to manage the outbreak. We can’t explain yet how this epidemic came about. The response team are heading to the epicentre of the outbreak from today,” Taido said.

Meanwhile next door in Liberia, President George Weah on Sunday put his country’s health authorities on heightened alert.

Weah “has mandated the Liberian health authorities and related stakeholders in the sector to heighten the country’s surveillance and preventative activities in the wake of reports of the emergence of the deadly Ebola virus disease in neighbouring Guinea”, his office said in a statement.





Neighouring DRC has faced several outbreaks of the illness, with the WHO on Thursday confirming a resurgence three months after authorities declared the end of the country’s latest outbreak.

DRC, which declared the six-month epidemic over in November, confirmed a fourth case in North Kivu province on Sunday.

The widespread use of Ebola vaccinations, which were administered to more than 40,000 people, helped curb the disease.

The 2013-2016 spread sped up the development of the vaccine against Ebola, with a global emergency stockpile of 500,000 doses planned to respond quickly to future outbreaks, the vaccine alliance Gavi said in January."

Health officials in Guinea yesterday reported an Ebola outbreak in the southeast, marking the first reappearance of the virus in the country since West Africa's massive outbreak that spanned 2014 to 2016.

Also, another illness was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is battling a flare-up in North Kivu province, the epicenter of a 2-year outbreak—the world's second largest—that was declared over in June of 2020.

Sick people attended funeral; 3 cases confirmed

The World Health Organization (WHO) office in Guinea said yesterday that the outbreak is occurring in a rural community of Goueke in N'Zerekore prefecture in the country's southeast, the region where West Africa's earlier outbreak began. The area is also near borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other two countries majorly affected by the 2014-16 outbreak.

The early investigation revealed that a nurse from a local health facility died on Jan 28, and after her burial, six people who attended the funeral experienced Ebola-like symptoms. Two died, and four are hospitalized. Guinea's national lab has confirmed three of the cases.

Funeral rituals, some of which involve handling the body, are known to amplify the spread of the virus.

Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, who leads the WHO's African regional office, said in a statement, ""It's a huge concern to see the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea, a country which has already suffered so much from the disease. However, banking on the expertise and experience built during the previous outbreak, health teams in Guinea are on the move to quickly trace the path of the virus and curb further infections.""

WHO staff are in Guinea to help with the outbreak response and to assist with getting Ebola vaccine into the country. The agency said efforts are under way to beef up surveillance in border areas and to notify other countries in the region that are at risk.

At a WHO media briefing today, Michel Yao, PhD, director of strategic health operations, said the samples belong to the Zaire subtype, the same one that fueled the earlier West Africa outbreak. He added that samples have been sent to the Pasteur Institute in Senegal for full-genome sequencing to determine if the virus represents a new introduction or is related to earlier spread.

West Africa's earlier outbreak, which began in Guinea and spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, resulted in about 28,000 cases, more than 11,000 of them fatal. Smaller related outbreaks occurred in Nigeria and Mali, with a few secondary infections reported in health workers in the United States and Spain.

Vaccination begins after DRC's 4th case

Elsewhere, DRC officials have confirmed a fourth case in an outbreak in North Kivu that was announced about a week ago, according to Reuters. No details were available about the patient.

The first patient is a woman who died in Butembo, which was one of the main hot spots in the DRC's 2018-20 outbreak. That outbreak was the world's second largest, after the earlier West Africa Ebola outbreak.

The woman whose case appears to have sparked the new DRC event was married to an Ebola survivor, and genetic tests on her samples are being conducted to determine if her illness represents a new introduction of the virus from an animal or other source or if it is linked to the earlier outbreak.

Survivors can harbor the virus in ""immune-protected"" areas of the body, such as the testes or the eyes. Sporadic cases in the months following Ebola outbreak have been traced to contact with body fluids of survivors.

The WHO said last week that it expected more cases to be reported, given several high-risk exposures among the first patient's contacts, including an unsecured burial.

On Twitter today, the WHO said an Ebola vaccine campaign has launched in Butembo, just 1 week after resurgence of the virus. Health workers at Matanda health center, where the first patient was treated, were the first to receive their doses."

Faced with a mix of confirmed and probable cases and deaths, the Republic of Guinea has declared its first resurgence of Ebola since 2016.

Two people have died in the DRC after confirmation of a new Ebola outbreak in the northeast.

The previous Ebola outbreak in the northeast, the country’s 10th and the second-largest in world history, claimed the lives of 2,287 of the 3,324 patients affected.

The DRC’s 11th outbreak, in Équateur Province, affected 13 of the province’s 18 health zones, with 130 confirmed cases and 55 deaths.

The DRC has been named the lead by the Africa Union in response efforts to the newest outbreak in Guinea.

RESPONSE

Since August 21, 2018, screening and referral units (SRUs) supported by International Medical Corps have provided more than 2 million screenings for Ebola and 1.2 million screenings for COVID-19.

International Medical Corps is providing infection prevention and control (IPC) support to 196 health facilities in the DRC to ensure that healthcare delivery is safe, including 20 new facilities in Équateur, and is activating its response team in Guinea.

West and Central Africa are facing renewed outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) while facing ongoing pressures from the COVID-19 pandemic, which already has put a strain on national and international health resources.

International Medical Corps is responding in both areas of the continent with strong regional teams of technical experts to support those in need where it is needed most.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)

Nearly four months following the end of the DRC’s 11th outbreak in November 2020 in the western province of Équateur, a new outbreak of Ebola was confirmed in the northeastern province of North Kivu on February 7, when samples collected from a woman in her mid-forties were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to be EVD. The patient passed away 72 hours later at a health facility in Katwa Health Zone, with symptoms of the virus. A test of the semen of her spouse, a known Ebola survivor, for EVD was reported to have returned negative just five months ago, yet such tests can sometimes show a false negative result. Preliminary results of genomic sequencing of the index case’s viral proteins suggest that this new outbreak—the 12th in the DRC—is linked to the first Ebola outbreak that occurred in this part of the country, which eventually grew to become the second-largest in history and required more than two years of concerted efforts to control. That outbreak claimed the lives of 2,287 of the 3,324 confirmed cases identified. The source of this reoccurrence (her spouse or some other source of infection) is still being investigated.

The index case, who came from Biena, sought care at a health facility in Katwa, where she passed away before the diagnosis could be made. In the course of her travels and during her stay at the hospital, several other people were exposed. Three confirmed cases have since surfaced (including a nurse who cared for one of the patients), two of whom have died. All but one of the confirmed cases—the nurse, who is still alive and responding well to treatment—had not received Ebola vaccine during the last outbreak.

The Republic of Guinea

On February 14, following seven cases (three confirmed and four probable, with one confirmed and four probable deaths) in the southeastern province of Nzérékoré, the government of Guinea declared an EVD outbreak. Initial results showed the presence of the virus in the town of Guéckédou—near where the initial case of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, in Meliandou, a rural village, was found.

This marks the first resurgence of the virus in the country since the devastating West Africa epidemic of 2014–2016. The government, under joint direction of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Agency for Health Security (ANSS), reactivated its Ebola response technical committee, and deployed to start active containment efforts. Because Nzérékoré borders Sierra Leone and Liberia, the threat of cross-border outbreaks is high."

It is certainly true that the existence of Ebola vaccines is one of the key differences from the outbreak in 2014 – 2016. And this is great news – but we need to be careful in how expectations are set. It is unlikely there will be enough vaccines to cover entire regions or prefectures. This will mean the choices about the use of the vaccine need to be very clearly explained, to avoid misunderstandings and potential distrust in communities affected by Ebola.



It all comes back again to community engagement. We have seen this many times in the past. If a community feels involved, heard and empowered, then an Ebola response will likely go well, with or without vaccines. But if a community feels side-lined, unheard and becomes nervous or distrustful, then an Ebola response will likely face multiple difficulties, with or without vaccines.

ACCRA, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) -- Franklin Asiedu Bekoe, head of disease surveillance at the Ghana Health Service (GHS), on Thursday refuted reports of a recorded case of the Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) in the country.

""It is not true that there is an Ebola outbreak in Ghana, what we have done is to issue a health alert,"" Asiedu Bekoe confirmed to Xinhua via telephone.

There were reports of an Ebola case recorded at the Korle-Bu Polyclinic in the capital on Wednesday.

The GHS on Tuesday asked all regional, district, and local health institutions to be on high alert as the deadly Ebola virus has been recorded in Guinea.

""EVD is a severe, often fatal illness in humans caused by the Ebola virus. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads to the human population through human-to-human transmission. It can be transmitted through contact with the body fluids of a person infected with the virus,"" a letter the GHS forwarded to its regional health directorates noted.

GHS further directed all regions, districts, and health facilities to initiate preparedness and response plans for EVD.

The cases showed symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of another relative (a 51 year-old nurse) on 1 February 2021.

The index case of the cluster was a nurse who had originally presented at a health centre in Gouécké on 18 January 2021 with headache, physical weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever. She was diagnosed with typhoid. She sought a second consultation at a health facility in Nzérékoré on 23 January 2021 for fever, vomiting, liquid stools, and physical weakness, and she was diagnosed with malaria. On 24 January she consulted a traditional practitioner in Nzérékoré, and she died on 28 January 2021. She was buried unsafely on 1 February in Gouécké. The other six cases are the five family members and the traditional practitioner she visited.

Among the seven cases, five have died (4 probable and 1 confirmed). The other two confirmed cases are currently in isolation in dedicated health care facilities in Conakry and Gouécké, Nzérékoré region.

The Ebolavirus species is not yet determined. Additional laboratory analyses are on-going to ascertain virus species.

As of 15 February, one hundred and ninety-two (192) contacts have been identified, including 164 contacts in N’Zérékoré Health District and 28 in Ratoma Health District, Conakry. To date, no contacts have been reported to have travelled in neighboring countries. However, Nzérékoré is the second-largest city in Guinea and lies at the intersection of roads from Ganta (in Liberia), Danané (Côte d’Ivoire), and roads to other major hubs in Guinea like Kankan and Macenta in (Guinea). Therefore, there is concern about the exportation of EVD cases into the neighboring countries.

On 14 February 2021, following the declaration of the EVD outbreak, the MoH of Guinea convened a crisis meeting.

The MoH , WHO, Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners, have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. To coordinate the response, the MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees. They also advised the public to take measures to avert the spread of the disease, and to report any persons with symptoms to seek care. Multidisciplinary teams have been deployed to the field to; actively search and provide care for cases, trace and follow-up contacts, and sensitize communities on infection prevention and control. Planned and in-progress response measures include the following:

Identify the source of the current outbreak;

Identify and follow-up contacts of all confirmed and probable cases;

Isolate all suspected cases, and assure their care;

Put in place infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health care facilities including train staff, establish triage processes, assess PPE supplies and access to hand hygiene resources and implement protocols for environmental cleaning and disinfection;

Conduct Assessments of health facility IPC preparedness using scorecard and develop action plans;

Strengthen case investigation, including active case finding in health care facilities;

Alert and inform all existing care services in the region;

Support laboratory capacities to process specimens from suspected case in a timely manner;

Strengthen public information and awareness of compliance with prevention and protection measures, including reporting to health services as soon as the first symptoms appear;

Promote safe and dignified burial of suspected, probable and confirmed deaths;

Initiate a ring vaccination strategy and vaccinate frontline workers.

Mobilize response resources;

Strengthen the capacity of the N'Zérékoré Ebola Treatment Centre

Set up response commissions with the authorities and partners, including WHO, the Red Cross, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), UNICEF, and UNFPA;

WHO support for the Guinean authorities

WHO will help supply vaccines, therapeutics, reagents and personal protective equipment.

WHO will be part of the partner coordination.

WHO will be involved in all pillars of the response, and will help to strengthen response in each area

WHO will recruit and deploy human resources to N'Zérékoré region to support investigation, contact tracing and vaccination.

In coordination with partners, WHO will work to reinforce risk communication and community engagement by deploying communicators and socio anthropologists.

WHO will provide logistic support, hygiene kits and IPC materials, where they are needed.

WHO risk assessment

WHO considers the risk of spread in the country as very high given the unknown size, duration and origin of the outbreak; potentially large number of contacts; potential spread to other parts of Guinea and neighboring countries; limited response capacity currently on the ground; and unknown virus strain. In addition, there are ongoing challenges for the public health system due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and recent yellow fever and measles outbreaks.

WHO assess the risk for the region as high. The Nzérékoré Region of Guinea shares borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, where EVD outbreaks occurred previously. Despite some movement restrictions across official border-crossings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cross-border movement continues to take place and poses a risk of EVD spread. It is therefore essential that neighboring countries assess their preparedness capacities and implement readiness/response measures.

The countries in the region should:

Conduct preparedness and readiness assessment

Develop preparedness and readiness plan

Map out immediate activities

Activate IMS for preparedness

WHO advice

WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission:

Continue to train and retrain the health workforce for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases as well as on safe and dignified burials and IPC measures;

Prepare for vaccination of health workers and implement ring vaccination around confirmed cases;

Engage with communities in responding to the outbreak and to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices;

Ensure availability of personal protective equipment and IPC supplies to manage ill patients and for decontamination in health care and community settings;

Ensure availability of biomedical equipment, essential medicines and therapeutics to care for patients with EVD;

Ensure implementation of a referral system: screening and triage at health centres with referral pathways to designated Ebola treatment centres;

Conduct health facility assessments (“Scorecard”) of adherence to IPC measures

Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission (through contact with fruit bats, monkeys and apes) through community education on how to: Handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing; and cook animal products (blood and meat) thoroughly before consumption;

Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients; and wash hands regularly including after any contact with patients or when coming into contact with any body fluids.

To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme.

Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Guinea."

She was a spouse of an EVD survivor, who has been followed up and whose biological samples have tested negative since 28 September 2020.

On 25 January 2021, the case presented with nasal bleeding. From 25 January to 1 February, she reportedly received outpatient care in Ngubi health center. From 1 to 3 February, she was admitted to Masoya health center with signs of physical weakness, dizziness, joint pain, epigastric pain, liquid stools, headache and difficulty breathing. On 3 February, a blood sample was collected for EVD testing due to her epidemiological link with an EVD survivor. On the same day, she was referred to Matanda Hospital, in Katwa Health Zone, Butembo territory following the deterioration of her condition. She was admitted to the intensive care unit the same day and died on 4 February. On 5 February, the body was buried in Musienene Health Zone, not under safe burial practices.

On 6 February, Butembo laboratory confirmed the case positive for EVD by GeneXpert. On 7 February, the sample was shipped to Goma laboratory, and tested positive for EVD by GeneXpert on 8 February.

As of 8 February 2021, a total of 117 contacts has been identified and are under follow up. Investigations and response activities are ongoing.

Public health response

An urgent meeting was convened on 8 February by the Minister of Health, and a team led by the Provincial Minister of Health of North Kivu was deployed to Butembo to organize immediate response activities;

Investigations are on-going in Katwa, Biena and Musienene Health Zones to identify the source(s) of transmission, identify contacts and conduct active case finding;

Health facilities that were visited by the case have been disinfected;

The decommissioned Ebola Treatment Center of Katwa is being assessed for reopening;

WHO is providing ongoing support to the national authorities through staff present in Butembo territory, by preparing shipment of vaccine doses to Butembo and supporting shipment of cold chain equipment to Butembo territory;

WHO and national authorities are strengthening laboratory capacities by ensuring availability of GeneXpert cartridges at Butembo laboratory; and

WHO is supporting local authorities to implement immediate actions including case investigation, case finding, contact listing and follow-up.

There are currently therapeutics (Regeneron and mAb114) available for up to 400 patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

WHO risk assessment

Preliminary information indicates that the patient visited at least three health facilities in two health zones and was unsafely buried in a third health zone (Musienene). There is therefore a risk of EVD spreading to other health zones. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.

The resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. The risk of re-emergence through exposure to animal hosts or bodily fluids of Ebola survivors cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak.

There are a number of ongoing challenges for surveillance, including access to affected areas and community mistrust toward authorities and outbreak responders. Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country’s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.

WHO advice

WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:

Continue to train and retrain the health workforce for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases;

Prepare for vaccination of health workers;

Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices; and

Ensure availability of personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control supplies to manage ill patients and for decontamination.

To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys and apes:

Handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing; and

Cook animal products (blood and meat) thoroughly before consumption and avoid consumption of raw meat from wild animals.

To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids:

Wear gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients at home; and

Wash hands regularly after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home or touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.

To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until two consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme.

Guinea has developed ultra-cold chain capacity with vaccine carriers, which can keep the vaccine doses in sub-zero temperatures for up to a week.
Guinea’s neighbours are on high alert, upping public health measures and surveillance to quickly detect and stop any cross-border Ebola transmission.","vaccine, curb, vaccination, ebola, doses, guinea, outbreak, health, support, starts, response, vaccines",ebola,pandemic,"Brazzaville/Conakry/Geneva – Ebola vaccination of people at high risk kicked off today in Guinea as the emergency response was escalated to counter the spread of the virus that re-emerged in the country a little more than a week ago for the first time since 2016.

The vaccination was launched in Gouecke, a rural community in N’Zerekore prefecture where the first cases were detected on 14 February. The Minister of Health and Public Hygiene of Guinea, General Remy Lamah, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Vincent Martin, the World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in Guinea, Dr Georges Ki-Zerbo and the UNICEF Representative in Guinea, Pierre Ngom, were among the officials at the event.

The vaccination uses the “ring strategy” where all people who have come into contact with a confirmed Ebola patient are given the vaccine, as well as frontline and health workers. The launch started with the vaccination of health workers.

“The last time Guinea faced an Ebola outbreak, vaccines were still being developed,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “With the experience and expertise it has built up, combined with safe and effective vaccines, Guinea has the tools and the know-how to respond to this outbreak. WHO is proud to support the government to engage and empower communities, to protect health and other frontline workers, to save lives and provide high-quality care.”

The vaccination began just 24 hours after Guinea received more than 11 000 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine which were sent by WHO from its headquarters in Geneva. In addition, WHO is organizing the deployment of over 8500 doses from Merck, the vaccine’s producer in the United States of America, bringing to around 20 000 doses expected in the initial phase of immunization.

The World Food Programme is providing crucial logistical support by setting up special flights to transport the vaccines and other supplies to N’Zerekore from Conakry.

The quick rollout of the Ebola vaccine is due in part to the capacity Guinea built up during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak. Around 50 Guineans were also deployed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to support the country’s response in the past three Ebola outbreaks and are now leveraging that expertise in their home country.

“The speed with which Guinea has managed to start up vaccination efforts is remarkable and is largely thanks to the enormous contribution its experts have made to the recent Ebola outbreaks in the DRC,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Africans supporting fellow Africans to respond to one of the most dangerous diseases on the planet is a testament to the emergency response capacity we have built over the years on the continent.”

Implementing an Ebola vaccination strategy is a complex procedure as the vaccines need to be maintained at a temperature of minus 80 degrees centigrade. Guinea has developed ultra-cold chain capacity with vaccine carriers, which can keep the vaccine doses in sub-zero temperatures for up to a week.

So far, there are eight Ebola cases (four confirmed and four probable) and five people have died. Genome sequencing is underway in Senegal’s Institut Pasteur to identify the strain of the Ebola virus. Guinea’s health authorities supported by WHO expert teams and partner agencies are stepping up efforts to identify contacts, set up treatment centres, enhance surveillance, support the vaccination campaign and work with communities to rally them behind the Ebola containment efforts.

Around 50 WHO international and national experts, including vaccinators, are already on the ground in Guinea and by the end of month, more than 100 WHO experts are expected to be part of the response to bring the Ebola outbreak under control. WHO has disbursed US$ 1.25 million to support the response in Guinea and to reinforce Ebola readiness in neighbouring Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone. The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund has also released US$ 15 million to support the response in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and preparedness in the neighbouring countries.

Guinea’s neighbours are on high alert, upping public health measures and surveillance to quickly detect and stop any cross-border Ebola transmission. N’Zerekore is Guinea’s second-largest city and is close to the border with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire.

As of February 25, nine Ebola cases have been reported in Guinea, resulting in five deaths, and eight cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in four deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
Between March 2014 and April 2016, there were more than 28,000 cases of Ebola in West Africa and 11,310 people died, according to the CDC.
Almost 30,000 people were monitored by the CDC for Ebola beginning in 2014, an effort that required hundreds of CDC staff, the CDC said.","cases, information, familiar, ebola, monitoring, program, guinea, travelers, implement, health, reported, cdc, airports, africa",ebola,pandemic,"The U.S. will soon be monitoring travelers coming into the country from two nations impacted by the Ebola virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. The CDC confirmed these plans after CBS News first reported the details on Friday night.

Starting next week, the ""very small number"" of travelers arriving from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be funneled to six U.S. airports where their information will be collected and shared with local health officials, the CDC said.

As of February 25, nine Ebola cases have been reported in Guinea, resulting in five deaths, and eight cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in four deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC stressed in its statement that ""the outbreaks are centered in remote areas of these countries,"" and said ""the risk of Ebola to the United States is extremely low.""

The CDC said airlines ""will collect and transmit passenger information to CDC for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days. This information will be shared with U.S. state and local health departments to appropriately monitor arrivals in their jurisdiction.""

A source familiar with the decision said John F. Kennedy in New York, Dulles outside Washington, D.C., O'Hare in Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Los Angeles International Airport and Newark Liberty outside New York were all being considered as monitoring points. The CDC did not specify which airports it plans to use.

This funneling approach is similar to steps taken in 2014 when travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were directed to five of those airports, where they had their temperature taken upon arrival.

Between March 2014 and April 2016, there were more than 28,000 cases of Ebola in West Africa and 11,310 people died, according to the CDC.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is recognition within the CDC that resources for additional monitoring are stretched thin, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions. Almost 30,000 people were monitored by the CDC for Ebola beginning in 2014, an effort that required hundreds of CDC staff, the CDC said.

""This is a great example of how we have to be prepared for anything in the public health arena,"" another source familiar with the discussions said about the monitoring before the news was announced.

In 2014, the Obama administration appointed Ron Klain to lead the U.S. Ebola strategy. Klain is now President Biden's chief of staff.

The stockpile, announced by the WHO, the vaccine alliance Gavi, and partners last month will eventually offer low and lower middle-income countries access to 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine.
Anja Wolz, coordinating MSF’s emergency response to the outbreak, said: “It’s true that a major difference with the 2014-2016 outbreak is that we now have treatments and vaccines.
Wolz believes the Ebola response in Guinea must be rapid and well thought through in order to minimise the risk of the outbreak becoming as severe as that of 2014-2016.
During West Africa’s first outbreak of Ebola, between 2014 and 2016, 28,000 people were infected and around 11,000 died in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.","vaccine, 20000, ebola, doses, emergency, guinea, wolz, outbreak, health, community, tackle, response, vaccines",ebola,pandemic,"As the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Africa this week, another vaccine was being rolled out in Guinea, in a bid to stop a fresh outbreak of Ebola in its tracks.

Mass immunisation got under way on Tuesday (February 23) after 11,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine landed in the West African country as part of an emergency response to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Twitter.

The Ervebo vaccines (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) are the first to be drawn from an emergency stockpile housed in Basel, Switzerland. The stockpile, announced by the WHO, the vaccine alliance Gavi, and partners last month will eventually offer low and lower middle-income countries access to 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine.

“We must avoid falling into the trap of thinking that because we have a vaccine we can pay less attention to the traditional responses to Ebola …” Anja Wolz, Doctors Without Borders (MSF)

Around 9,000 additional doses were also due to arrive in Guinea from the United States, the WHO said.

Drawing on experience of the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), experts believe that the vaccine rollout, which began nine days after the first cases were confirmed, is a crucial part of the emergency response.

Georges Ki-Zerbo, WHO representative in Guinea, said: “The vaccine can help us manage the situation by protecting communities exposed to reported cases.”

Doctors Without Borders (MSF), sounded a note of caution, however. Anja Wolz, coordinating MSF’s emergency response to the outbreak, said: “It’s true that a major difference with the 2014-2016 outbreak is that we now have treatments and vaccines. [But] the best use of the vaccine will depend on the quantities available and transmission modes.

“We must avoid falling into the trap of thinking that because we have a vaccine we can pay less attention to the traditional responses to Ebola, such as contact tracing, safe funeral practices, and community engagement, as well as the treatment and isolation of patients.”

According to Wolz, if communities are involved in and support the response, the benefit is “huge”. Conversely, if the community is afraid or antagonistic, things can become a lot more complicated, whether vaccines are available or not.

Response teams are already on the ground in Guinea where questions remain about how the outbreak started.

Ki-Zerbo told SciDev.Net that the causes of the outbreak were being investigated by scientists using the “One Health” approach encompassing the health of people, animals, and the environment. This approach targets public health risks emerging from the human-animal-environment interface.

The WHO released a statement on 17 February tracing the movements of the first known victim, a nurse who had originally presented at a health centre in the town of Gouecke on 18 January with symptoms including headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. She was initially diagnosed with typhoid and later, at a second health facility, with malaria. She died on 28 January.

Six other cases of the virus were subsequently confirmed – five family members of the nurse and a traditional medicine practitioner she had visited.

“The fact the first recorded case was a health care worker does suggest community transmission may have already been occurring,” said Wolz. “But we need to piece together a detailed history of contacts to establish the antecedents to this first recorded case.”

‘Complex’ crisis

According to the WHO, 192 contacts had already been identified by 17 February and there was no indication at that date that contacts had travelled to neighbouring countries (Liberia and Ivory Coast).

“Everything is being done to stop this outbreak becoming as widespread as the one we witnessed from 2014-2016,” stressed Ki-Zerbo.

“The lessons learned from the 2014-2016 outbreak must be fed into this intervention while bearing in mind the complexity related to the COVID-19 response, the complexity of the cross-border dynamics and community engagement,” he added.

The rollout in Guinea comes as Ghana became the first country outside India to receive COVID-19 vaccines via the COVAX facility, established during the global pandemic to ensure equitable access to the vaccines.

Wolz believes the Ebola response in Guinea must be rapid and well thought through in order to minimise the risk of the outbreak becoming as severe as that of 2014-2016. She hopes the availability of treatments will make it easier to encourage people to access health care and to quickly self-isolate.

“If the messages are appropriately communicated, we have o a much better chance of being able to conduct effective contact tracing and break the chains of transmission,” she added.

During West Africa’s first outbreak of Ebola, between 2014 and 2016, 28,000 people were infected and around 11,000 died in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

• Outbreak in Guinea, Congo DCR worry PTF

• FG assures on COVID-19 vaccine’s availability, safety, efficacy

The Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 (PTF) is enhancing surveillance at the nation’s points of entry to respond to recent outbreak of Ebola in neighbouring countries, especially, Guinea and the Congo DCR.

Nigeria’s Port Health Services have been put on alert on land, while sea and Air borders as well as major hospitals have also been put on notice for a keen index and to check patient travel history, especially at Outpatient departments, and report concerns to infectious disease focal persons and state epidemiologists.

This came as the Federal Government, yesterday, assured that the country would soon get safe and efficacious COVID-19 doses as promised, despite recent concerns over efficacy of the vaccines following emergence of new variants.

It was gathered that the Africa Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) had allocated 1.4 million free doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to Nigeria, of which 500,000 doses are expected by the end of this month, courtesy of MTN’s donation of 7 million doses to Africa. The balance of 900,000 doses for Nigeria is expected by the end of March 2021.

Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, who disclosed this at the PTF briefing yesterday in Abuja, noted that Nigeria was willing to send experienced volunteers from its Centres of Excellence on Viral haemmorrhagic fever, to support the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) measures to contain Ebola resurgence in West African sub region. He stressed that it would be important to protect the sub region from the catastrophic burden of dealing with two severe diseases of public health concern.

Ehanire, who further stated that ​Nigeria would work with the West Africa Health Organisation (WAHO) and WHO on strategies to bring the Ebola outbreak under control and provide regular updates on preparedness, containment and response measures in due course, stressed that stricter infection prevention and control measures, including Personal Protective measures, must be taken immediately there is reason to suspect a case in Nigeria.

He noted that ​the Federal Ministry of Health constantly monitored diseases of public health concern around the world and was observing the Ebola disease outbreak in Guinea Conakry with concern.

The minister, in view of these developments, renewed the call on Nigerians to limit foreign trips only to very essential ones, and to altogether avoid high burden countries and those with particularly deadly disease outbreaks for now, so as not to pick up such diseases or become a vehicle for their importation.

He said that the Federal Government had continued to work on rollout of COVID-19 vaccines when they arrive, warning that all COVID vaccines carry a certain amount of risk and any vaccines not approved by the Federal Ministry of Health through its agencies would not be used in Nigeria.

The minister noted that government would not be responsible for the safety or efficacy of vaccines given outside the framework of government and that all Nigeria’s needs had been carefully calculated by NPHCDA, even as it would be possible to accommodate all interests in the framework.

He observed that government had inaugurated the Vaccine Coordination Committee, an Interministerial, multi-sectoral committee to address diverse issues peculiar to COVID-19 vaccine acquisition by Nigeria.

Ehanire explained that their function was to advise on coordinating access to acquisition and distribution of vaccines when available, and on immunisation strategy.

He said, “Other sources of vaccines are under negotiation. The National Agency For Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has received dossiers for Sputnik V vaccine of Russia, Covishield or Astra Zeneca manufactured under license by Serum Institute of India, Covaxin by Bharat vaccines of India and the Sinopharm Vaccine of China, for evaluation and validation for use in Nigeria. Some of them are nearly ready for results.

“I received a message from His Excellency, the High Commissioner of India, giving 100,000 AstraZeneca or covishield vaccine doses, also by the Serum Institute of India, as a gift of the Government of India to Nigeria. The people of Nigeria appreciate these gestures of goodwill and partnership. With regard to the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT), Nigeria this morning completed her account opening, signed by two officials each, of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance, Budget & National Planning, at Afrexim Bank as a requirement for access to vaccines on that platform, which will give Nigeria access to a much larger portfolio and variety of vaccines. Among the vaccines are the Johnson & Johnson single dose vaccine and as much of the Pfizer mRNA vaccines as we can manage. The COVID-19 Vaccine Coordinatiing Committee and NPHCDA’s strategy for vaccine delivery will advise the mix of vaccines that Nigeria will acquire”

Also speaking, Chairman of PTF and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Mr. Boss Mustapha stated that Nigeria would keep a keen eye on the Ebola outbreak to avoid having to combat two deadly diseases at the same time."

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with writer Véronique Tadjo about her book, In The Company of Men. It's a novel about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, first published in French in 2017.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

The new novel ""In The Company Of Men"" is full of scenes that feel eerily familiar - health care workers maxed out and running low on supplies, tending to patients who might not get better; family members who can't hug, kiss or care for each other, afraid of spreading a contagious virus. These are not portraits of COVID-19. The author, Veronique Tadjo, sets her novel in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak that devastated the region starting in 2014.

VERONIQUE TADJO: I wrote this book in French first in 2017, so there was absolutely no idea of a pandemic.

SHAPIRO: So the English translation of this book arrives at an uncanny moment. Parts of it read like a journalistic account of the Ebola crisis, and other chapters are more like mythic fables, told from the perspective of a tree or a bat. I asked Tadjo why she combined these styles.

TADJO: We are constantly fed by news. This is our life from morning till evening. But at the same time, we wish for more. It's not so much facts we are after, but a way to interpret those facts as they impact on our lives. So it's important that we keep that human dimension when we have stories happening somewhere else, but in fact, much closer to us than we think.

SHAPIRO: Nearly every chapter of the book has a different narrator. And so we see this Ebola outbreak from the perspective of a doctor, a patient, a grave digger, a researcher. And in many cases, we never learn their names. Can you tell us about one of them?

TADJO: I think perhaps my favorite is the nurse because she had a lot of hopes in medicine, in technology, in progress in general. But then she was confronted by this terrible disease, and she realized that the country was not ready. And I've seen so, so, so many women like that who work in hospitals and who know that they are working in conditions that are not right and that what they have been asked to do is almost an impossible mission. But they do it, and they do it with such courage.

SHAPIRO: When did you realize the parallels between the story that you were writing and the present-day reality that the whole world is now living?

TADJO: It just happens that the translation is coming out now and that I see the resonance. But I wanted to tell the story of this terrible epidemic in West Africa because at the back of my mind, there was always this idea that this was not over. There's always going to be a looming threat because the more I research the subject, the more I realize that a lot of things were interconnected. Like, the environmental issue was at the forefront of the problem of the epidemic as well.

SHAPIRO: And when you look at the book again, through the lens of the global pandemic that we are all facing now, do you see parts of it differently?

TADJO: Yes, I do. I do. Because, for example, I object terribly to this idea of putting a nationality, if you want, an identity to epidemics because, in fact, viruses don't see borders.

SHAPIRO: So you're saying whether a virus originated in West Africa or in China ultimately doesn't matter?

TADJO: At the end of the day, it doesn't. And also, it would be bad to feel that some people are virtuous and others are not, that somehow you can put a blame game. And that's not constructive in terms of fighting the disease together.

SHAPIRO: Would you read from a section of the book for us? This is Page 25.

TADJO: Yes, with pleasure.

(Reading) Simply touching another person is enough for someone to become infected. This plague is worse than war. A mother, a father, a son can become a mortal enemy. Pity is a death sentence.

SHAPIRO: I love that line, pity is a death sentence because it captures so effectively how the gestures of affection and consolation and connection become the vectors of disease.

TADJO: Yes, and that's the really, really terrible thing because we have seen, like today, how it's impossible to rely on our former relationships. So many people have been isolated by the COVID-19 virus. And we understand the loneliness of our condition, how even feelings as strong as love become some way incapable of bridging the threat of possible death.

SHAPIRO: One of the narrators in this story says science alone is not going to bring the virus under control. It will take persuasion. And when I read that, I thought of how much it applies to our situation today where people are afraid of the coronavirus vaccine. How did it become clear to you that science is not enough to solve a pandemic?

TADJO: It became clear to me that you need to convince people to be on the side of science. But it's difficult because sometimes people lose confidence in their leaders. And when they do, they do not trust what is being said to them.

SHAPIRO: You write about hoaxes and disinformation in the Ebola outbreak and the realization that the scientific community needed to bring traditional healers on board who were sometimes dismissed. There are just so many uncanny parallels.

TADJO: Yes, it's interesting, yeah? It's just that you see something like traditional medicine in Africa has been virtually abandoned officially. But unfortunately, modern medicine has failed the majority of the people in the sense that the medical infrastructures are not there for the majority of the people. So there is some kind of a mistrust. Therefore, they tend to go back to the healers. So it was important to get the collaboration of the healers so that they could help fight the disease because they were the closest to the majority of the people.

SHAPIRO: So having spent so much time thinking about the Ebola pandemic, what lessons do you wish people trying to fight the coronavirus pandemic learned?

TADJO: Huh, that's a difficult one. First, you have to say resilience. But you also have to say a sense of solidarity. We are all in it together. It's only when we work together that we can defeat such threats to humanity. So I think that I would really, really like to see more solidarity within each country and across countries.

SHAPIRO: Veronique Tadjo's new novel is ""In The Company Of Men.""

Thank you for talking with us about it.

TADJO: Thank you very much.

Homam Shahhoud, who leads MSF’s medical response in North Kivu, provides this update on the Ebola response:

“We are supporting the Matanda general hospital, in the Vungi health district, and the Muchanga health center, in the Muchanga health district, by improving triage and the early identification, diagnosis, and admission to care of people potentially sick with Ebola. We are going to provide them with effective treatments to increase their chances of survival and reduce the suffering caused by the disease.

“We are working with local families to identify contacts of confirmed patients and protect them from the disease via the most appropriate tools, based on their level of exposure to the risk of infection. We will provide them with the means to isolate if necessary and to seek immediate medical care in case of symptoms. We will also help existing health facilities in the Katwa health zone and in other areas affected by the outbreak, to strengthen infection prevention and control measures and limit the spread of this deadly disease.

“Helping families to cope with the outbreak is critical. To this end, MSF has developed a community-based approach focusing on dialogue with patients and their families, and on supporting; people affected by the disease. We need to make sure they have the means to protect themselves and get treated. Our intervention will be flexible and centered on patients’ needs. We will intervene in the health districts that need help, coordinating with the local health authorities and other partners."

This was the largest Ebola outbreak reported to date—28,000 cases were recorded, including 11,000 deaths.

This was the largest Ebola outbreak reported to date—28,000 cases were recorded, including 11,000 deaths. It originated in Guinea and then spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The confirmed cases this time have been reported from the southeast of Guinea about 800 km by road from the capital, Conakry, but only about 100 km from various border points with Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire. The concern is that the virus could spread to other locations in Guinea as well as neighboring countries if it is not rapidly contained. Jacqueline Weyer answers questions about the latest outbreak.

What’s been done to keep new Ebola outbreaks from developing since 2016?

The development, evaluation, and registration of Ebola vaccines and antivirals have been major activities in the years following the 2014-2016 outbreak. Since then, two vaccines have been pre-approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and registered with different regulatory bodies.

During the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a number of countries in the region established national registration of these products as well. Nearly 50,000 people were vaccinated as part of the containment efforts in the DRC. Ring vaccination—vaccination of individuals in a ring around cases—with the Ebola vaccine is a vital tool in the prevention of the spread of the infection as it produces a barrier of immunity that disrupts the chain of transmission of the virus.

Why has Ebola returned?

The natural transmission cycle of the virus involves certain species of forest-dwelling fruit bats. These act as a reservoir of the virus in nature and this cycle is continuous, ensuring that the virus is maintained in nature over time. The virus may, however, spill over from its natural reservoir either to other forest-dwelling animals or directly to humans to set off an epidemic in the human population.

Ebola-infected animals such as non-human primates, monkeys, and antelope have been reported before and could present a source of exposure to humans. For example, hunters or people slaughtering these animals come into contact with infected blood and tissues. But, it is also believed that spillover may occur through direct contact from infected bats into humans. The exact mechanism remains to be defined, but contact with infected blood and tissues are likely sources of infection.

The virus is always present in nature and, when circumstances allow for it, may jump from one species to another.

What lessons from previous Ebola outbreaks are being applied now?

There are many important lessons but, arguably, swift and sure action will make the difference. In the aftermath of the 2014-2016 outbreak, the apparent lag in the initial responses was a major critique of the response efforts.

It is critical to contain the outbreak early before it spreads beyond ground zero to other locations in Guinea and to neighboring countries. If this happens, more protracted and complicated efforts for containment will be required.

One feature that sets this outbreak apart is that it is happening against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic—which has health-care and other resources around the globe under severe pressure.

International support has been a mainstay in the containment efforts in West Africa, but also in most Ebola outbreaks reported to date. Time will tell how efforts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic impact on Ebola containment efforts.

Does Guinea have the health infrastructure to manage the disease?

Access to healthcare in Guinea has improved marginally over the years. But the country struggles with one of the worst health-care infrastructures in the world. Most deaths in Guinea remain associated with communicable, maternal, and neonatal diseases and nutritional disorders. The Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016 did galvanize intensified efforts towards improving healthcare systems in the country, but progress is slow.

Given that the west Africa Ebola outbreak ended only five years ago, one would assume that some of the infrastructure that was developed during the outbreak remains, and could be rapidly brought back in use. The “muscle memory” for public health response to Ebola gained from the previous outbreak in Guinea will be put to the test in the coming weeks.

What’s the relationship between the outbreak in west Africa and central Africa?

Studies conducted during and following the 2014-2016 outbreak show that the Zaire ebolavirus species was circulating in local bat populations in west Africa before the outbreak. The genomic similarity of the Ebola viruses associated with the west Africa outbreak and Ebola viruses that have caused outbreaks in central Africa since 1976 supports the hypothesis that the virus did at some point spread from central Africa to west Africa.

On the other hand, when analyzing the differences between these viruses, there is evidence for separate evolution over space and time. The exact mechanism of spread from central to west Africa remains unclear. But the transfer is plausible given, for example, that many fruit bat species—some of which are implicated as natural reservoirs of Ebola virus—are migratory, and may migrate over large distances.

Efforts are under way to determine the genomic sequence of the virus associated with the recently reported cases. This could point to the potential source of the outbreak and indicate the link between these viruses associated with the recent cases, and the viruses that circulated during the previous outbreak. Another consideration is that currently available Ebola vaccines have not been tested against strains other than Zaire ebolavirus. The efficacy of these vaccines against other species of the virus is, therefore, unsure.

Yakubu Mohammed Saani, country director of ActionAid DRC, says one of the biggest challenges in preventing the spread of both Ebola and Covid-19 is tackling the misinformation about the diseases and vaccines.
“*Fake news and misinformation about Ebola, Covid-19 and the vaccines that can curb these deadly diseases, is rife and there is a lot of mistrust within communities*,” Saani says.

“*Fake news and misinformation about Ebola, Covid-19 and the vaccines that can curb these deadly diseases, is rife and there is a lot of mistrust within communities*,” Saani says.

“*ActionAid is working with local partners and women’s groups in North Kivu to share life-saving public health advice within their communities. We know from our response to the last Ebola outbreak and Covid-19 that this is the best way to build trust and reach the most vulnerable. *

“*Our response to the pandemic and previous outbreaks mean we are prepared to fight this latest emergence of Ebola. However, people in DRC are facing multiple health crises and rising violence and insecurity. Disease will spread quickly in crowded displacement camps and women and girls are at greater risk of sexual and gender-based violence*.”

Widespread misbeliefs about Ebola include that it’s a curse or a demonic possession that can be cured by pastors, and many people think that Covid-19 doesn’t exist or that it cannot spread in Africa because of the climate. Common misperceptions about the vaccines against both diseases include that they can make women infertile and men impotent, and that they are designed to kill people, rather than protect them.

As many people do not have access to TVs in remote areas, ActionAid uses local radio stations to share public health advice about Ebola, reaching 500,000 people in Nyiragongo in North Kivu.

The humanitarian and social justice organisation has provided training to women in Nyiragongo on preventing the spread of Ebola and Covid-19, and is distributing hygiene kits, including hand sanitiser and facemasks, to families across five areas. Local partners have installed handwashing stations and provided access to clean water.

Women leaders have also received training about identifying and reporting cases of violence against women and girls. ActionAid has supported communities in Nyiragongo to build a women’s leadership centre which acts as safe space for women to share the problems they face, including gender-based violence.

Speaking from North Kivu province where new cases of Ebola were discovered earlier this month, ActionAid DRC project officer Cecile Kasoki says:

“*People in North Kivu are feeling scared about this Ebola outbreak, especially as it comes during Covid-19 and the economic crisis the pandemic has caused. They are worried there won’t be the resources to fight this latest threat and that the international community will not assist poor countries like DRC as they are battling the pandemic in their own countries*.”

She adds: “*The women leaders we’ve trained are confident and ready to deal with the new outbreak. They are breaking down the traditional barriers limiting what women are told they can do. Their communities trust them, but there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of supporting people to protect themselves from Ebola and Covid-19*.”

Potential cases of Ebola began emerging in the West African nation in late January, and Guinean health officials declared an outbreak on February 14 after three people tested positive for the virus.
Rather, the most recent cases appear to be a resurgence of the same strain that caused the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak, carried by someone who was infected back then.
Researchers have known that Ebola virus can stick around in the body after recovery.
Still, public health officials may need to alter Ebola vaccination strategies, Rasmussen says.","cases, vaccination, infected, ebola, recent, ago, outbreak, latest, virus, started, strategy, viruses, pollakis",ebola,pandemic,"The ongoing Ebola outbreak in Guinea was most likely sparked by someone infected during the outbreak seven years ago, a new study shows. Viruses from both outbreaks are almost genetically identical, hinting that the virus did not jump from an animal to people, as scientists expected, but that it had lurked hidden in a human body for years.

“With this news, I was really, really shocked,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

Potential cases of Ebola began emerging in the West African nation in late January, and Guinean health officials declared an outbreak on February 14 after three people tested positive for the virus. The region hadn’t seen an outbreak since the one in 2013–2016, which claimed over 11,000 lives. A separate, unrelated outbreak in the Congo was declared on February 7.

As of March 6, 29 cases and 13 deaths had been reported in both countries, according to Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A genetic analysis found that four viruses from people infected in the Guinea outbreak were the close relatives of viruses that had infected people in 2014, according to a trio of preliminary reports posted March 12 at virological.org. Only about a dozen mutations separate these new cases from the 2014 cases. That’s far fewer than the more than 100 mutations scientists expect would accumulate over that period if there were sustained transmission of the virus.

The lack of mutations suggests that the newest outbreak did not get its start when a bat virus jumped into humans and began spreading. Rather, the most recent cases appear to be a resurgence of the same strain that caused the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak, carried by someone who was infected back then.

Researchers have known that Ebola virus can stick around in the body after recovery. Some cases in West Africa during the 2013–2016 outbreak stemmed from individuals who had been infected and had recovered months, or even more than a year, earlier. But the new findings show the most recent outbreak began after a five-year lull in cases and suggest that the virus wasn’t replicating during that time, meaning the virus may have gone dormant.

The finding “suggests some sort of weird mechanism that hasn’t been seen before,” Rasmussen says, but doesn’t mean that Ebola outbreaks from dormant viruses in humans are going to be happening all the time. Right now, what might have happened is “a mystery. We’ll probably solve [the mechanism], but right now there’s just not very much known about it.”

Other recent research backs up the idea that Ebola can lie low in the body for years. Immune proteins that recognize the virus spiked in the blood in 39 out of 51 people months after those people recovered, molecular virologist Georgios Pollakis and colleagues reported in the Feb. 18 Nature. Though the team could not find evidence in the blood that the virus was replicating, the roused immune response hints that the virus could be hiding somewhere in the body.

“We were quite surprised to see [that] data,” says Pollakis, of the University of Liverpool in England.

For Pollakis, the new developments emphasize the need for continued surveillance and research on diseases that aren’t top-of-mind. “The biggest lesson is that public health needs serious investment,” Pollakis says. “We focus on what is [spreading] faster, on the biggest player. And then we leave the virus that doesn’t seem to be a burden for the moment… now it comes back to haunt us.”

Though experts say transmission of the virus from people infected long ago appears to be rare, the outbreak raises fears that Ebola survivors could face new stigmas.

Health officials have sprung into action across the region to isolate potential contacts in the current outbreak and vaccinate them and their contacts, a strategy known as ring vaccination (SN: 5/18/18). In Guinea, about 500 contacts have been identified, and over 1,600 people vaccinated as of March 5.

Still, public health officials may need to alter Ebola vaccination strategies, Rasmussen says. While the current strategy is to control outbreaks with ring vaccination, “we need to think about maybe having a mass immunization campaign — not using vaccination as a control strategy but as a prevention strategy.”"

The discovery was revealed in a genetic analysis of viruses from the current outbreak that was conducted by scientists from Guinea, the Institut Pasteur in Senegal, the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the University of Edinburgh. It was posted online Friday.

The scientists compared several genetic sequences from the current outbreak — in which 18 people have been infected to date — with sequences from viruses collected during the West African outbreak. Given the long interval between the two events, the assumption had been that this new outbreak was triggered by a new spillover of Ebola viruses from nature. That wasn’t what researchers found.

“The new genomes are most closely related to five identical Ebola virus Makona variant genomes sampled in August 2014 from the same region,” the scientists reported. Makona is the name of the Ebola Zaire strain that caused the 2014-2016 outbreak.

The new viruses had a small number of mutations — roughly a dozen. That’s far fewer than what one would have expected if there had been ongoing but undetected transmission of the virus in the region.

On Twitter, Rasmussen noted that given the rate at which the Makona variant evolved during the 2014 to 2016 period, the current viruses would have been expected to have amassed hundreds of mutations.

“The results are quite remarkable,” said Mike Ryan, who heads the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program. Ryan said that the rate at which the virus had changed was far slower than the rate at which the Makona strain evolved during the 2014-2016 outbreak.

He warned the news could lead to further stigmatization of Ebola survivors, if they are seen within their communities as possible long-term sources of the virus. “Survivors deserve our support,” Ryan said. “They’ve been to hell and back.”

He suggested the finding underscores the need for programs that support survivors and that include follow-ups on their health. It also highlights the need to learn more about the phenomenon known as “viral persistence.”

Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of emerging diseases from Canada’s University of Manitoba, recently received a research grant to do just that; he will be working with survivors of the West African outbreak in Sierra Leone.

He, too, was dumbfounded by the finding. “There’s that lump-in-your-throat moment,” Kindrachuk admitted.

It’s been known for years that some survivors of Ebola harbor virus in their bodies for periods of time after their infection.

The virus hides in places where the immune system can’t ferret it out — the testicles of some infected men, occasionally in the eyeball, or in spinal fluid. In some rare cases, survivors suffer a relapse when the virus reactivates. A Scottish nurse who worked in Sierra Leone during the West Africa outbreak, Pauline Cafferkey, suffered three bouts of disease over a couple of years.

These wells of hidden Ebola in survivors can also on rare occasions infect other people. Transmission events typically involve a male survivor who infects a female sexual partner.

The working hypothesis is that this is what happened in the most recent case. But currently there aren’t enough details known about how this outbreak started to be able to trace back the event to a survivor of the earlier outbreak.

The first known case in the current Guinea outbreak was a nurse who became sick in mid-January and died on Jan. 28. A number of the subsequent cases were people who attended her funeral on Feb. 1. But there have been reports the nurse had cared for her mother, who had been sick before her.

Daniel Bausch, a veteran of multiple Ebola outbreaks, said that in most known cases where a survivor has infected another person, it’s been a man who passed the virus to a sexual partner in his semen. Finding a male who might have transmitted the virus to the nurse or her mother — or someone else before them — might not be doable at this point.

“Can we get that far back? I don’t know. The trail gets cold pretty readily when everybody’s dying,” said Bausch, director of the U.K. Public Health Rapid Support Team, a partnership between Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We may never know.”

Bausch noted that until the West African crisis — which was the first time Ebola transmitted in African cities — outbreaks were small, often only a few dozen cases. The West African outbreak involved more than 28,000 cases and over than 11,000 deaths.

Prior to that, the largest was in Gulu, Uganda, in 2000 and involved 425 people, which at the time was thought to be a hellishly large event.

But more recently, the northeastern corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo endured a two-year battle with Ebola in an outbreak that recorded 3,470 cases and 2,287 deaths. Bausch said this new experience with large outbreaks — which leave large numbers of survivors — may be giving the world a chance to see something that it could never spot in outbreaks of 50 or 60 people that left only 20 or so survivors.

“Is this just that now we have a sample size that is big enough so that rare events, we’re catching [them]?” he wondered."

The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing an additional $8 million in assistance to support the rapid response to the Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Guinea, and to strengthen Ebola preparedness in seven high-risk border countries across East Africa and West Africa (République de Côte D'Ivoire, Republic of Liberia, Republic of Mali, Republic of Rwanda, Republic of Senegal, Republic of Sierra Leone, and Republic of Uganda). The additional $8 million brings USAID’s total assistance to more than $11.5 million since the outbreaks began in early February 2021.

USAID assistance is supporting disease surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory and diagnostics testing, and the establishment of Ebola treatment and transit centers; strengthening infection prevention and control in major health facilities, including hygiene promotion, triage and isolation; providing training to health care workers; and promoting risk communication and community engagement activities. USAID has also extended the work of humanitarian partners who participated in previous Ebola outbreaks in DRC.

USAID’s funding is part of a whole-of-U.S. Government response to the current Ebola outbreaks which incorporates lessons learned from past outbreaks. The United States continues to coordinate response efforts with the Ministries of Health in DRC, Guinea, and neighboring countries, as well as local, regional, and multilateral partners to ensure efforts are well-integrated and aligned with each country’s Ebola response plan.

OLYMPIA, Wash. — Public health officials in Washington state are monitoring 23 low-risk people who recently traveled from areas experiencing an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, according to the Washington State Department of Health (DOH).

There is a low risk for people in Washington, state health officials said. The individuals are considered ""persons under monitoring"" for 21 days after their arrival to the United States, according to health officials.

The DOH said there is an outbreak of EVD in N’Zérékoré Prefecture of Guinea and the North Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) issued an order requiring airlines to collect and provide the CDC with contact information for passengers who were in Guinea or the Democratic Republic of Congo within 21 days before arriving in the United States.

Local public health officials are tasked with conducting health monitoring and other follow-ups for 21 days after the travelers arrive in the U.S.

According to the CDC, Ebola symptoms include fever; aches and pains, such as severe headache, muscle and joint pain, and abdominal (stomach) pain; weakness and fatigue; gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting; abdominal (stomach) pain; unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising; red eyes, skin rash, and hiccups (late-stage).

Many common illnesses can have the same symptoms as EVD including influenza (flu), malaria, or typhoid fever.

EVD is a rare and deadly disease in people and nonhuman primates, according to the DOH. The viruses that cause EVD are located mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and are spread through direct contact with an infected animal, like a bat or nonhuman primate, or a sick or dead person infected with EVD.

From 2014 to 2016, an Ebola outbreak in West Africa became a global epidemic, according to the CDC. Eleven people in the United States were diagnosed with the disease. Two of them died."

The last patients from the ongoing Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea were discharged from care this week, initiating the countdown to declaring the outbreaks over, WHO said.

According to WHO, the last Ebola patient from the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was discharged from a treatment center in Katwa, North Kivu province, on Monday — 37 days after a resurgence of the disease was identified in the region.

Source: WHO

WHO said the last patient in Guinea was discharged Tuesday night in the city of N’Zérékoré, 38 days after the start of that outbreak, which has been genetically linked to the West African epidemic that ended in 2016.

For an Ebola outbreak to be declared over, there must not be any new cases for 42 days — the length of two incubation periods.

During the outbreak in the DRC, 12 people have been infected and six have died. Early on, officials announced that the outbreak began when the wife of a previous outbreak survivor sought medical attention for Ebola-like symptoms nearly 8 months since the outbreak had been declared over. She later died. According to WHO, more than 1,700 people were vaccinated in the outbreak to mitigate further spread.

The Guinea outbreak the first in the country since the West African epidemic that left more than 28,000 people infected and 11,300 dead has resulted in 18 cases and nine deaths. More than 3,900 people have been vaccinated during the outbreak, according to WHO.

WHO said teams will remain on the ground to support local health authorities with surveillance, pathogen detection and community engagement through the 42-day countdown."

A man in Africa who developed Ebola despite receiving a vaccine recovered but suffered a relapse nearly six months later that led to 91 new cases before he died. The report adds to evidence that the deadly virus can lurk in the body long after symptoms end, and that survivors need monitoring for their own welfare and to prevent spread.

Relapses like this one from the 2018-2020 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo are thought to be rare. This is the first one clearly shown to have spawned a large cluster of new cases. The New England Journal of Medicine published details on Wednesday.

Earlier this month, scientists said a separate outbreak that’s going on now in Guinea seems related to one in West Africa that ended five years ago. A survivor may have silently harbored the virus for years before spreading it.

“The most important message is, someone can get the disease, Ebola, twice and the second illness can sometimes be worse than the first one,” said Dr. Placide Mbala-Kingebeni of the University of Kinshasha, who helped research the Congo cases.

As more Ebola outbreaks occur, “we are getting more and more survivors” and the risk posed by relapses is growing, he said.

Ebola outbreaks usually start when someone gets the virus from wildlife and it then spreads person to person through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated materials. Symptoms can include sudden fever, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, rash and bleeding. Fatality rates range from 25% to 90%.

The case in the medical journal involved a 25-year-old motorcycle taxi driver vaccinated in December 2018 because he’d been in contact with someone with Ebola. In June 2019, he developed symptoms and was diagnosed with the disease.

For some reason, the man never developed immunity or lost it within six months, said Michael Wiley, a virus expert at Nebraska Medical Center who helped investigate the case.

The man was treated and discharged after twice testing negative for Ebola in his blood. However, semen can harbor the virus for more than a year, so men are advised to be tested periodically after recovery. The man had a negative semen test in August but did not return after that.

In late November, he again developed symptoms and sought care at a health center and from a traditional healer. After worsening, he was sent to a specialized Ebola treatment unit but died the next day.

Gene tests showed the virus from his new illness was nearly identical to his original one, meaning this was a relapse, not a new infection from another person or an animal, Wiley said. Tests showed the man had spread the virus to 29 others and they spread it to 62 more.

Previously, two health workers who got Ebola while treating patients in Africa were found to have the virus long after they recovered — a Scottish nurse in her spinal fluid and American physician Ian Crozier in his eyes. But those relapses were discovered quickly and did not spawn new outbreaks.

They and the man in Africa all were treated with antibodies during their initial infections. Antibodies are substances the body makes to fight the virus but it can take weeks for the most effective ones to form. Giving them to Ebola patients is thought to boost the immune system, and studies suggest they improve survival. But the relapses have doctors concerned that such patients might not develop a strong enough immune response on their own and might be vulnerable to recurrences once antibodies fade. It’s just a theory at this point, the researchers stressed.

A few other viruses can lurk for long periods and cause problems later, such as the one responsible for chickenpox, which can reactivate and cause shingles decades after initial infection.

The news about latent Ebola tells us “absolutely nothing” about the chance of something similar happening with the bug that causes COVID-19 because “they’re totally different viruses,” Wiley said.

Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, a World Health Organization scientist, agreed.

“We haven’t seen yet this kind of latency from people who survived coronavirus,” he said. Even with Ebola, “after six months, most of the patients completely clear the virus.”

The biggest concern is better monitoring for survivors -- there are more than 1,100 in the Congo alone, and the WHO recommends monitoring for at least two years.

“We need to make sure that survivors are not stigmatized” and get the help they need so any relapses are treated quickly, Fall said.

During the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the U.S. CDC confirmed 11 cases of Ebola in the U.S., mostly among medical workers who had traveled to Africa to assist with the response.","cases, disease, drc, information, ebola, guinea, contact, health, outbreak, requires, cdc, travelers, collect, spreads",ebola,pandemic,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is requiring airlines to collect contact information for all passengers from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo amid two separate Ebola outbreaks in the African countries.

Beginning Thursday, airlines will be required to collect and handover contact information to the CDC for all travelers to the U.S. who have been in the DRC or Guinea within the last 21 days before their arrival in the U.S., the CDC said Tuesday. On Friday, the CDC announced that it would funnel travelers from the two countries through six U.S. airports in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, the District of Columbia, Newark and Los Angeles.

The risk of Ebola spreading to the U.S. is ""extremely low,"" the CDC said last week, but health officials are readying their public-health response protocols to ensure the disease doesn't enter the country.

""Timely public health follow-up requires health officials to have immediate access to accurate and complete contact information for travelers as they arrive in the United States,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. ""Any delay in contacting exposed individuals can increase the likelihood of disease spread.""

Airlines will be required to collect travelers' names, addresses while in the U.S., primary contact phone numbers, secondary or emergency contact phone numbers and email addresses, the CDC said in a statement. It's ""the minimum amount of information needed to locate travelers reliably,"" the CDC added.

The information provided by travelers will be ""verified by U.S. government officials on arrival to ensure it is accurate and complete,"" the CDC said. The agency noted that a Feb. 2020 rule authorized the CDC to impose such a requirement on airlines.

""Air travel has the potential to transport people, some of whom may have been exposed to a communicable disease, anywhere across the globe in less than 24 hours,"" the CDC said. ""In certain situations, public health officials may need to follow up with travelers who have arrived from a country where an outbreak is occurring, such as the Ebola outbreaks in DRC and Guinea.""

The World Health Organization is responding to two outbreaks of Ebola, one in the West African nation of Guinea and another in the DRC in Central Africa. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said Monday that 13 cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Guinea, with four more listed as probable.

The cases in Guinea appear to be currently contained in the remote N'Zerekore and Gueckedou regions in southern Guinea, Ryan said. He added that 99% of about 500 identified people who have been exposed to the virus are being followed. More than 1,100 people have been immunized against Ebola since its reemergence last month, he added.

Separately, Ryan said that eight cases, including four deaths, have been confirmed in the DRC. No new cases there have been reported since Feb. 22, Ryan said.

Unlike the highly infectious coronavirus, which can be spread by people who don't have symptoms, Ebola is thought to spread mainly through people who are already visibly sick. The virus spreads through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of people who are sick or who died of the disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ebola has an average case fatality rate of 50%, though it can vary by outbreak, according to the WHO.

The reemergence of Ebola in Guinea and the DRC has global health specialists particularly concerned because those countries are home to the two worst Ebola outbreaks in history. The outbreak in the DRC that was declared over in June lasted for nearly two years. By the time it ended there were 3,481 total cases and 2,299 deaths, according to the WHO.

The infamous West Africa Ebola outbreak began in Guinea in 2014 before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the WHO. By its end in 2016, there were more than 28,000 cases, including over 11,000 deaths, WHO says.

The new outbreak has reached 17 cases, 13 of them confirmed and 4 listed as probable, Mike Ryan, MD, director of the World Health Organization (WHO) health emergencies programs, said today at a briefing.

Cases concentrated in southern Guinea

The cases are contained in the N'Zerekore and Gueckedou prefectures in southern Guinea, and surveillance has been stepped up in other parts of Guinea and in neighboring countries, Ryan said. Though the increase in cases is concerning, he said outbreak responders have made good headway on tracking and contact tracing, and of about 500 contacts identified, about 99% are being followed.

So far, more than 1,100 people have been immunized as part of a ring vaccination strategy.

Ibrahima Soce Fall, MD, assistant director-general for emergency response at the WHO, said the rapid scale-up in surveillance and response is a sign that investments are working. And though health officials expect to see more cases, experienced teams in Guinea are working and engaging with local leaders, he added.

Ryan said the outbreak total in the DRC remains at 8 cases, 4 of them fatal. He added that no new cases have been reported since Feb 22.

CDC announces public health steps, travel warnings

In a related development, the CDC announced on Feb 26 that starting this week, the US government will funnel travelers from the DRC and Guinea to six US airports. In a statement, it said airlines will collect and send passenger information to the CDC on passengers who were in the DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days. State and local health officials will use the information to monitor people arriving from the countries.

The CDC said the steps are being taken out of an abundance of caution and that the measures apply to a small number of travelers. It added that outbreaks are occurring in remote areas of the two countries and that the risk to the United States is extremely low.

""The Biden Administration is committed to working closely with the affected countries to end these outbreaks before they grow into epidemics,"" the CDC said.

On Feb 24 the CDC posted level 3 travel warnings for both countries, which advise against nonessential travel to outbreak areas of the DRC and Guinea. The agency added that if work requires possible exposure to Ebola, adults traveling to the two countries should be vaccinated against Ebola, as recommended on Jan 8 by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices."

Upon confirmation of the outbreaks, the U.S. Government (USG) implemented a forward-leaning, whole-of-government response to help quickly control and end the outbreaks. USG personnel in affected and border countries immediately supported national preparedness and response activities, such as survivor care, surveillance, and overall infection prevention and control, building on capacities strengthened in past Ebola outbreaks. And, the USG has committed more than $3.5 million in assistance to support the rapid responses. The COVID-19 outbreak has further confirmed that the health and safety of one country is the health and safety of the world. The Biden administration is committed to being a strong public health partner by supporting DRC, Guinea, and communities experiencing these outbreaks. USG agencies and Embassies are working closely with local, national, and international partners to ensure the response efforts are well integrated and aligned. These efforts include:



Facilitating access to Ebola vaccines and therapeutics: The vaccines that DRC and Guinea are receiving come from a global Ebola vaccine stockpile established January 2021. A $20 million USG contribution, provided to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and specifically dedicated to support a stockpile of licensed Ebola vaccines funded the first deliveries of doses into the stockpile. The USG has coordinated delivery of 120 treatment courses of U.S.-developed Ebola therapeutics to Guinea, with more doses available, if needed.



Increasing response capacity: To increase response capacity and save lives, the USG is helping the DRC, Guinea, and neighboring countries to increase disease surveillance, laboratory, infection prevention and control, and emergency management capacities, as well as access to diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. The USG is also working to enhance risk communications, access to safe and dignified burials, and supporting survivors.



Increasing surveillance and case management systems: The CDC has provided guidelines and standard operating procedures for finding cases, and is also supporting critical epidemiology and disease surveillance systems in affected and neighboring countries to establish transmission chains. USAID is funding partners to support active surveillance, community engagement, and supporting the establishment of Ebola treatment and transit centers.



Strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) practices: In close collaboration with WHO, Africa CDC, and other partners, the USG is creating and deploying IPC training, mobilizing response staff, and engaging Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali to ensure readiness for potential cases. USAID launched a program to strengthen IPC in major health facilities, including hygiene promotion, triage and isolation, and training of health care workers.



Supporting community engagement activities to increase awareness: To promote behaviors that decrease risk of transmission, the U.S. Embassy in DRC is activating its network of exchange program alumni and opinion leaders. USAID is supporting risk communication and community engagement activities. And, CDC is supporting community feedback and mass communication activities, as well as helping to build capacity to report rapidly and accurately community questions, perceptions, and concerns.



Mitigating the risk of spread to the United States: The ability to identify and locate those in the U.S. who may have been exposed to Ebola is critical to help prevent the spread of the disease within U.S. communities. On March 2, 2021, CDC issued an order that went into effect on March 4 requiring airlines and aircraft operators to collect and transmit passenger contact information to the USG for the purposes of public health follow-up. In support of CDC’s order, the Department of Homeland Security is directing operators of aircraft to funnel passengers who in the last 21 days traveled from, or were otherwise present within, the DRC or Guinea to one of six United States airports where the USG is focusing public health resources to implement enhanced public health measures.

A new Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea appears to have been sparked by a person who was first infected during the country’s previous epidemic five years ago, suggesting persistent infections in survivors could be a source of future outbreaks.

Recent preliminary analyses of viral genome sequences by N’Faly Magassouba at the Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Conakry in Guinea and his colleagues, along with other research teams, revealed that the virus responsible for the current cases hardly differs from the strain that caused the previous epidemic. This indicates the virus may have lain dormant in someone who caught it in 2016.

“This is very surprising and very shocking,” says César Muñoz-Fontela at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Germany, who was in Guinea during the previous Ebola epidemic. “It’s like a relapse.”

Read more: Guinea is swiftly vaccinating people to contain latest Ebola outbreak

There were 28,646 reported cases during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in west Africa and 11,323 reported deaths. These new findings indicate that some of the people who survived could still harbour the virus years later and potentially pass it on to others.

“What does that mean for [Ebola virus disease] survivors?” says Magassouba. He fears the new findings will worsen existing stigmatisation of these people.

Researchers already knew that Ebola could persist in the body for a long time, but five years is unprecedented, says Muñoz-Fontela. In 2016, a resurgence of the 2013-2016 epidemic in Guinea was traced back to a survivor who shed the virus in their semen for at least 531 days after first becoming infected, and transmitted it to their partner.

It is possible that the virus behind the current outbreak in Guinea may have persisted in a person’s body before being transmitted in a similar way, says Muñoz-Fontela.

In addition to semen, Ebola can also persist in other so-called immune-privileged sites in the body – those parts that are difficult for the immune system to reach – such as cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system or fluid in the eye called the vitreous humour.

The first known Ebola virus outbreak was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, but the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa was much larger, which could explain why more cases of persistent infections in survivors have been detected in recent years. It might be that this is relatively rare, so it is only becoming apparent now that there are larger numbers of survivors, says Muñoz-Fontela.

Another possibility, he says, is that viral persistence is an inadvertent consequence of an increased availability of treatments. “Now we have [treatments] that can save people [who] in the past were impossible to save – and when you have persons with that amount of virus in the blood, the treatment itself may push the virus to these immune-privileged sites.”

Screening for persistent Ebola virus infections and vaccinating the contacts of Ebola virus disease survivors could help to protect people and prevent future outbreaks, says Magassouba, although availability of vaccines could be a limiting factor. As of 16 March, there had been 18 cases and 9 deaths in the new outbreak in Guinea, with 366 contacts of cases identified and 3332 people vaccinated.

“We are using the ring vaccination,” said Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, the Assistant Director-General of WHO responsible for emergency response, referring to the strategy that inhibits the spread of a disease by vaccinating only those most likely to be infected.

“We are vaccinating the contacts of cases, the contact of contacts, and their contacts. With this strategy we are able to control this type of outbreak. But we are going to need more vaccines,” Dr Fall told journalists in Geneva on Friday.

Limited stocks

“If the outbreak spreads to other countries, we have limited stocks” said the Director of Strategic Health Operations at WHO, Dr. Michel Yao.

He was speaking by videoconference from the town of Nzérékoré in Guinea, one of the epicentres of the outbreak, which is near the border with Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.

The last Ebola outbreak in Guinea, which started in 2014, quickly spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. By the time it was finally brought under control, it had become the deadliest Ebola outbreak since the virus was first detected in 1976, with some 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

Borderline readiness

“There are six neighbouring countries to Guinea, and we conducted a self-assessment of readiness,” said Gueye Abdou Salam, Regional Emergency Director of WHO’s regional office for Africa, speaking from Brazzaville. “Two of the countries are not ready, and one country is on the borderline and there are three countries that are more or less ready.”

Having faced previous Ebola outbreaks has given health authorities a considerable advantage this time around, the experts agreed.

“It is important to learn the lessons from these outbreaks,” said Dr. Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo, the WHO Representative in Guinea, who highlighted the need to secure the trust of local communities in all the areas where vaccination campaigns were planned.

“Where we launch the vaccination campaign in Gouecke, a few kilometres from there is the village of Wome. This is where a team of officials and responders were trapped and actually killed in the last outbreak in 2015. So, we need to take that into account when we engage with communities to make sure that we listen to them,” Dr. Ki-Zerbo said.

Deadly pathogens

There is broad consensus among health officials that acting quickly is a crucial factor in controlling the spread of Ebola, but that preventive measures and better preparedness are also needed to protect people from a broader range of pathogens.

Dr Fall maintained that the world will face an increasing number of health epidemics, especially as human habitats encroach on forest areas.

“We are increasingly in a situation in which we have to face multiple epidemics,” he said. “Countries must be enabled to respond to multiple epidemics, but especially through preventive measures.”

One current challenge is that the strong focus on the COVID-19 pandemic is making it more difficult to focus global attention on the tools needed to respond to any other emerging pathogens."

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) simply don’t stop during a pandemic—in fact, they become a bigger concern as we navigate through unknown territory. The same concern is coming up more and more with emerging infectious diseases like Ebola. Here are some issues we should be keeping an eye on.

Ebola Outbreak in Guinea Sparked by Previously Infected Individual

The Ebola outbreak in 2014/2016 was devastating for West Africa. Globally, we all experienced the fallout of the largest Ebola outbreak in history and one that revealed a deeply vulnerable health care system within the United States. In the latest outbreak within Guinea, at least 18

people have been infected with Ebola virus disease, and nine have died. What is sparking concern though isn’t just that this is a new outbreak in an area that has already experienced the hardships of Ebola, according to the journal Science, but a much more impacting finding: “The virus causing the new outbreak barely differs from the strain seen 5 to 6 years ago, genomic analyses by three independent research groups have shown, suggesting the virus lay dormant in a survivor of the epidemic all that time. ‘This is pretty shocking,’ says virologist Angela Rasmussen of Georgetown University. ‘Ebolaviruses aren’t herpesviruses’—which are known to cause long-lasting infections—'and generally RNA viruses don’t just hang around not replicating at all.’”

Why is this concerning? We know that survivors can shed virus in semen, but that an entirely new outbreak would be triggered by a latent infection 5 to 6 years after the initial infection is deeply worrisome. Understanding more of how additional infections and even outbreaks might be sparked by survivors is still something we’re working to address."

Ebola long-term infectionSo what then is Ebola?
Ebola viruses, of which there are six species, are probably bat viruses that cause what is known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other animals.
How might Ebola viruses establish this long-term persistent infection?
We can try to get rid of the persistent infection through targeted vaccination or treating survivors – trials are already underway for persistent infection treatments.","viruses, chronic, infected, ebola, cause, persistent, virus, cells, heres, shouldnt, panic, infections, infection, longterm",ebola,pandemic,"Ebola is back in Guinea in West Africa, five years after the largest Ebola epidemic ever known ended – but it has not come back the way we expected it to.

Eighteen people are reported to have been infected, of which nine have died. Although vaccines against Ebola exist and have been rolled out, there is the fear that these small clusters of infection could ignite into something much, much larger.

What’s unusual about the virus that has caused this new outbreak is that it doesn’t seem to have come from an animal but from a human. The individual was probably infected during the 2014-16 epidemic.

While Ebola is thought to be a short-term infection, this latest outbreak highlights the grave potential of longer-term infections. But do we have to now reassess everything we thought we knew about these classic acute, “self-limiting” viral infections?

Acute versus persistent

Many viral infections are acute (sudden onset) and self-limiting – that is, they resolve on their own. Think of things like the cold, flu or measles: you’ll get infected, feel lousy for a couple of days or so and then it will clear up and you’ll go back to your life. What’s happening inside your body is a different story, though. In the few days following exposure, the virus gets inside your cells and replicates millions of times, which spreads the infection further through your body and can be released to transmit to another person.

This burst of infection triggers an immune response that seeks to limit onward spread. Sometimes the virus itself kills infected cells. Eventually, potent antiviral defences are produced composed of B cells and antibodies, as well as T cells. Antibodies and T cells mop up the residual infection and expunge your body of infected cells. After a few weeks, there’s no trace of the original infection, and in its place you’ll have some immunity to the infection in the near future.

However, not all viruses are dispatched in such a swift manner. Some can resist the antiviral immune response and linger for years or even a lifetime. Viruses such as HIV, herpes and hepatitis B and C are ones that cause long-term infection, and while they are at it, long-term disease. (Although it should be noted that not all long-term infections – such as pegivirus infections – lead to long-term disease.)

These long-term infections are known as persistent or chronic infections. Herpes viruses can cause a special kind of persistent infection known as a latent infection, where it lingers in the body for years or decades, without replicating. For a virus to survive in the face of an immune response, it must have strategies to mitigate our defences either through direct antagonism or by mutation and evasion. Also, persistent infections occur in so-called immune-privileged organs such as the brain, the eyes and the testicles. These organs can tolerate an infection without eliciting an inflammatory immune response.

Ebola long-term infection

So what then is Ebola? Ebola viruses, of which there are six species, are probably bat viruses that cause what is known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other animals. EVD comes on swiftly, causing a fever, flu-like symptoms, diarrhoea and haemorrhage, which can lead to organ failure and death. This systemic infection is characterised by a very high level of virus in the blood, organs and bodily fluids.

Survivors of EVD can suffer debilitating long-term effects. Following the 2014 epidemic in West Africa, several discoveries were made regarding the long-term infections caused by the Ebola virus in recovered people in the eyes and male genital tract. In some circumstances, months later, recovered patients could even succumb to a second episode of disease caused by the virus. What’s unique about the recent resurgence in Guinea is that the length of time is greater than we had previously identified, and that, worryingly, has led to more than one infection.

How might Ebola viruses establish this long-term persistent infection? Given that they cause a large systemic infection, they probably gain easy access to immune-privileged tissues, such as the eyes or testes. In some rare cases, infection of long-lived cells in these organs combined with low levels of viral replication would be consistent with the resurgence in Guinea.

What now?

The blurring of the line between acute and persistent infections has been happening for decades. Classically acute infections have been found to establish a persistent state in some circumstances. For example, a study from 1978 found that healthy young people working at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, were infected with parainfluenza viruses for up to six months, despite being in total isolation. Parainfluenza viruses usually cause short-lived common cold symptoms. Measles, which typically runs its course in two weeks, can lay dormant in the brain for years before reappearing and causing a brain disorder called sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis.

Given that we now know that some infections can resist clearance from the body, cause disease at a later date and ignite another outbreak, should we be concerned? The truth is, most acute infections are just that: acute infections. This will be especially important to bear in mind with Ebola, which has the potential for increasing the stigma faced by survivors of this terrible disease.

We can try to get rid of the persistent infection through targeted vaccination or treating survivors – trials are already underway for persistent infection treatments. We might even be able to exploit this biological phenomenon to make better vaccines that continuously dose the immune system throughout the inoculated person’s lifetime."

The information must include the passenger’s full name, an address while in the United States, a primary and secondary contact phone number while in the United States, and an email address that the passenger will routinely check while in the United States.
The reporting requirements apply only to the orders stemming from the Ebola outbreak and do not modify procedures in effect in response to the coronavirus pandemic, noted AOPA Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Murray Huling.
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the first known outbreak of Ebola virus disease—a severe and often fatal illness—occurred in 1976.
Also in February, nine cases of Ebola virus disease, including five deaths, occurred in the Republic of Guinea.","disease, states, international, information, ebola, prompts, united, republic, outbreak, travel, health, africa, restrictions",ebola,pandemic,"The Department of Homeland Security has imposed travel restrictions on all flights, to include general aviation, arriving in the United States with persons aboard who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Republic of Guinea in response to a resurgence of the Ebola virus in the two countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued an order requiring collection of passenger information for contact tracing.

Beginning at 11:59 p.m. on March 4, flights carrying individuals who have been present in, or traveled from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Republic of Guinea within 21 days of their travel to the United States must land at one of six designated airports where officials are “focusing public health resources to implement enhanced public health measures,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a notice.

The airports where the affected flights must land are John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Chicago O’Hare International Airport Newark Liberty International Airport , or Los Angeles International Airport

In conjunction with the travel restrictions, the CDC issued an order requiring airlines and aircraft operators to collect eligible passengers’ contact information before boarding. The information must include the passenger’s full name, an address while in the United States, a primary and secondary contact phone number while in the United States, and an email address that the passenger will routinely check while in the United States. GA operators must submit the information using the Electronic Advance Passenger Information System (eAPIS). Information collected about crewmembers would be transmitted by encrypted email or other CDC-approved means within 24 hours the CDC’s request.

The reporting requirements apply only to the orders stemming from the Ebola outbreak and do not modify procedures in effect in response to the coronavirus pandemic, noted AOPA Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Murray Huling.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the first known outbreak of Ebola virus disease—a severe and often fatal illness—occurred in 1976. An epidemic of the disease occurred in western Africa from 2013 to 2016. Between 2018 and 2020 there was an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the cases identified there in February are believed linked to that occurrence.

Also in February, nine cases of Ebola virus disease, including five deaths, occurred in the Republic of Guinea. The World Health Organization expects that more cases will be identified and has notified six neighboring countries to be alert for potential infections, the notice said."
