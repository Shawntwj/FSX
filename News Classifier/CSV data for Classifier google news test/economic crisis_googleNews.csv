1,2021-02-11 00:00:00,Malaysia’s economy shrank in 2020 by the most since Asian crisis,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/11/malaysias-economy-shrank-by-most-in-2020-since-asian-crisis,"Economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 5.6 percent last year, with lockdowns likely to lead to more pain, analysts say.
Malaysia’s economic contraction quickened again in the fourth quarter, as a fresh virus wave late in 2020 helped drive the economy to its worst annual showing since the Asian financial crisis.
The economy contracted 5.6% for all of 2020, its worst performance since 1998 and below the government’s projection of -3.5% to -5.5%.
Still, she added, the central bank has room to provide further support to the economy if needed.
The government last month unveiled a 15 billion ringgit package to help the economy weather the impact from the recent surge in Covid cases.","2020, malaysias, contraction, worst, 2021, shrank, asian, crisis, cases, ringgit, bank, support, economy"

Capital Economics expects full-year 2021 growth to come in at 7%.
She said monetary policy will “remain accommodative in an environment of modest prices,” and that the central bank has sufficient policy space to provide further support if needed.
Last month, the central bank left its overnight policy rate at a record low of 1.75%.
The central bank said it expects inflation to trend higher this year, after 10 straight months of decline largely due to low retail fuel prices.","central, biggest, annual, economic, posts, growth, 2021, crisis, quarter, fell, policy, 1998, bank, 2malaysias, performance, update, decline, economy"

Sudan's central bank said in a statement the transitional government had decided on ""reforming and unifying the exchange rate system by applying a managed flexible exchange rate system"".
The US embassy in Khartoum said on Twitter that ""we welcome the Sudanese government's courageous decision to move forward today with exchange rate reform"".
The central bank said its policy shift, which follows the recent appointment of a new cabinet tasked with tackling the economic crisis, is ""imperative"" to help achieve stability.
The exchange rate policy shift comes amid concern that Sudan's level of foreign currency holdings are approaching exhaustion.","central, market, international, foreign, economic, announces, exchange, rate, crisis, policy, currency, sudan, bank, amid, shift, managed, float"

During the global financial crisis of 2008-09, many central banks cut interest rates close to zero.
Negative central bank rates lower borrowing costs for businesses and households.
Higher banking fees could also limit how low negative rates could go -- depositors can avoid being charged negative rates or fees on their deposits by choosing to store banknotes instead.","central, rates, interest, zero, rate, explainer, policy, negative, banks, bank, work, read, cut"

Although the kingdom was largely spared the worst of the virus, pandemic-spurred partial lockdowns have hit the economy hard.
""The Thai economy relies on investment and exports.
The country's economy was struggling even before the pandemic, which laid bare the deep inequality between the haves and have-nots of Thai society.
""The outbreak and vaccine rollout, together with tourism recovery, are the main economic factors this year.""","cent, collapse, political, economic, tourism, worst, shrinks, thailand, 1997, pandemic, countrys, thai, danucha, economy"

The UK’s poor economic performance was the result of worse outbreaks of coronavirus than in most other countries, resulting in longer lockdowns and in households saving more of their income.
On top of this, UK statisticians adopted different methods for measuring public sector output than other countries, which resulted in a larger recorded drop in output.
The ONS, however, said most of the UK’s poor performance relative to other countries was genuine rather than a statistical aberration.
