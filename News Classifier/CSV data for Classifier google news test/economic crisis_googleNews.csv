Singapore marked its worst-ever recession in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although the contraction moderated in the fourth quarter as the country lifted more coronavirus-related curbs, putting the economy on path to a slow and patchy recovery.

The Southeast Asian financial and transport hub was hit hard last year by local virus-related restrictions, border closures around the world and a sluggish global economy.

The bellwether economy shrank by 5.8 percent in 2020, preliminary data showed on Monday, slightly better than the official forecast for a contraction of between 6.5 percent and 6 percent. The government has previously said it expects gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 4 percent to 6 percent this year.

The city state has eased most of its coronavirus rules, although its borders remain largely shut. It began its COVID-19 inoculation programme last week and the government is keen to open more of the economy with the help of the vaccine in a country dependent on travel and trade.

“Recovery going forward in 2021 will probably continue to be quite gradual,” said Barclays regional economist Brian Tan. “And a lot of it will depend on the speed at which the government can distribute the COVID vaccines and whether or not this can allow us to reopen the borders more quickly.”

But some analysts were more optimistic about Singapore’s economic outlook.

“A key thing to note is that the advanced estimate is based on the first two months of the quarter and is frequently subject to large revisions,” Alex Holmes, Asia economist at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a research note sent to Al Jazeera.

“Strong improvements in manufacturing [purchasing managers indexes] and trade data elsewhere in the region suggest that, after the inclusion of December data, the estimates of Q4 and 2020 Singapore GDP will be revised up,” Holmes wrote.

GDP contracted by 3.8 percent in October-December compared with the same period in 2019, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement, an improvement over the 5.6 percent year-on-year drop in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline of 4.5 percent, according to the median of their forecasts.

Stable but uneven

GDP grew 2.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis in October-December, slowing from the 9.5 percent expansion in the third quarter.

The Singapore dollar edged up to 1.3203 per United States dollar, its highest since April 2018, after the data was released.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week that while the economy was seeing signs of stabilisation, the recovery will be uneven and activity is likely to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels for some time.

The Singapore government has spent about 100 billion Singapore dollars ($75.45bn) or 20 percent of its GDP, on virus-related relief to support households and businesses.

The central bank left monetary policy unchanged at its last meeting in October and said its accommodative stance would remain appropriate for some time.

“We don’t expect any changes in the monetary policy for now,” said Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank. “The main bulk will still remain in fiscal policy in order to support the economy to recovery in 2021.”"

This is Singapore's first annual contraction since 2001, and its worst recession since independence.

Singapore has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic amid movement restrictions and border closures, with construction, aviation and tourism among the most affected.

The Government had estimated that Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) would contract between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent in 2020.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, Singapore’s GDP grew by 2.1 per cent in the final quarter of 2020, following the 9.5 per cent expansion between July and September.

Singapore entered a ""circuit breaker"" period in April to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, shutting down non-essential businesses.

It exited the circuit breaker period in June, gradually reopening the economy and is now in Phase 3. It has also started a vaccination programme, beginning with healthcare workers.

The Government has spent about S$100 billion on virus-related relief to support households and businesses. It expects Singapore to return to growth this year, but has cautioned that the recovery would be gradual.

HOW EACH SECTOR DID

Manufacturing continued to outperform, expanding 9.5 per per cent in the fourth quarter, and 7.1 per cent for the entire year.

Growth was mainly due to expansion in the electronics, biomedical and precision engineering clusters, which outweighed declines in the transport engineering and general manufacturing clusters, MTI said.

However, on a quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, it shrank by 2.6 per cent, after expanding by 12.6 per cent in the third quarter.

The services sector contracted by 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and 7.8 per cent for the whole year.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, it grew by 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, softening gains of 6 per cent it saw in the previous quarter.

Within the sector, the communications, finance, insurance and professional services cluster did better than trade-, hospitality- and administrative-related industries.

The construction sector was the worst performer, contracting 33.7 per cent for the full year. The building industry, however, appeared to be on the mend, with the contraction easing to -28.5 per cent in the last quarter from -46.2 per cent in the preceding quarter as more construction activities resumed.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the sector grew for the second quarter in a row by 34.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending the 39 per cent growth in the third quarter. ​​​​​​​"

WASHINGTON (AP) — The global economy will experience a subdued recovery this year from the devastating pandemic, the World Bank predicted Tuesday, but it warned that the near-term outlook is highly uncertain and growth could be imperiled if coronavirus infections and delays in the rollout of vaccines continue.

In its new Global Economic Outlook, the World Bank forecast 4% growth this year following a 4.3% decline in 2020, the biggest plunge in global output since a contraction of 9.8% in 1945 as nations demobilized at the end of World War II.

By comparison, the global recession triggered by the Great Depression of the 1930s saw growth shrink by 4.8% on average from 1930 through 1932. The 2008 financial crisis triggered a 1.8% drop in global output in 2009.

“If history is any guide, the global economy is heading for a decade of growth disappointments unless policy makers put in place comprehensive reforms,” the bank warned, citing the global pandemic layered over economic trends already in play.

“While the global economy appears to have entered a subdued recovery, policymakers face formidable challenges in public health, debt management, budget policies, central banking and structural reforms,” said World Bank President David Malpass.

The bank said global growth will be aided by a recovery this year to GDP growth of 3.5% in the United States and an even bigger 7.9% rebound in China, the world’s two biggest economies. For 2020, the World Bank expects GDP in the United States to fall by 4.3% while it predicted a modest 2% increase in China.

Because of the uncertainty caused by the current resurgence in virus cases and initial problems in distributing vaccines, the World Bank cautioned that its forecast is highly uncertain.

Under a scenario where virus cases continue to rise and the rollout of the vaccine does not accelerate, global growth could be reduced to a meager 1.6% this year.

The new report boosted global growth for 2020 by 0.9 percentage-points from its June forecast, reflecting in part a better-than-expected performance in China and the United States. But the forecast trimmed the outlook for 2021 by 0.2 percentage points.

For the United States, the decline for 2020 was revised up by 2.5 percentage points to a smaller decline of 3.6%, and the 3.5% rebound for 2021 was lowered by half a percentage point.

To combat the sharp downturn, the World Bank has made $160 billion available to help more than 100 countries protect the poor, support businesses and bolster the recovery.

Malpass, in a briefing for reporters, said the World Bank was making available $12 billion to provide 1 billion COVID-19 vaccinations in poor countries.

“People at the bottom of the income scale were hardest hit by the shutdowns and recession and will most likely be the slowest to regain jobs and get vaccinations,” Malpass said.

The World Bank expects the euro area will suffer a 7.4% drop in growth for 2020 followed by a 3.6% rise in 2021, while it says Japan’s growth will fall 5.3% in 2020 and then rebound by 2.5% this year.

For all advanced economies, the World Bank predicted a drop of 5.4% in 2020 and a rise of 3.3% in 2021. For emerging markets and developing countries, the World Bank said when all figures are reported, growth will have dropped 2.6% in 2020 followed and that will be followed by an increase of 5% this year."

With France and Italy, the euro zone’s second and third biggest economies, each forecast to shrink by 9% in 2020, Thursday’s preliminary data underlines how the crisis is increasing discrepancies within the 19-country currency bloc.

The contraction was smaller than a Reuters poll forecast of -5.1% and less severe than the record -5.7% suffered in 2009, during the financial crisis. Adjusted for calendar effects, gross domestic product declined by 5.3%, the statistics office said.

“It was actually a year of disaster, but judging by what had been feared in the course of the year, one could say we got off lightly,” LBBW analyst Uwe Burkert said.

The statistics office said growth probably stagnated in the fourth quarter but carried positive momentum into 2021, suggesting Germany has so far managed to cope relatively well with a second wave of COVID-19 infections.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government has since March unleashed an array of measures to help companies and consumers in Europe’s biggest economy through the pandemic.

The debt-financed programmes include liquidity aid for struggling firms, job protection schemes for employees, tax cuts and cash handouts to boost domestic demand and long-term investments in green technologies and public infrastructure.

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin will do everything it can to ensure 2021 becomes the year of recovery but cautioned that overall growth could be somewhat smaller than previously projected.

The government estimated 2021 GDP growth of 4.4% in an October forecast due to be updated later this month. The Ifo economic institute expects 4.2% growth this year.

BORROW AND SPEND

The fiscal splurge was possible because parliament suspended constitutional limits on budget deficits, sending government borrowing to record highs.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running as the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor at elections in September, is expected to rack up a total of more than 300 billion euros in new debt in 2020 and 2021.

The public sector, including federal states, municipalities and social security systems, ran a budget deficit of 158.2 billion euros ($192.31 billion) or 4.8% of GDP, the office said.

That marked a severe deterioration of public finances following a surplus of 52.5 billion euros or 1.5% in 2019.

Private consumption tumbled 6% in 2020 on the year although disposable income edged up on average thanks to state aid and the Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme, the office said.

Lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus meant many consumers were not able to spend their money, so the net savings rate ballooned to a record high of 16.3%.

This pent-up spending power could boost household spending from the second quarter of 2021 if lockdown measures are gradually lifted in spring, the statistics office said.

Exports plunged nearly 10% while imports dropped 8.6%, suggesting that Germany’s traditionally large trade surplus narrowed in the course of the pandemic.

The only bright spots came from government spending, which pushed up state consumption by 3.4%, and construction, where investment in building rose 1.5%, the preliminary data showed.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Janet Yellen, sworn in Tuesday as the nation’s 78th Treasury secretary and the first woman to hold the office, said in a message to the department’s 84,000 employees that they would play a major role in addressing the country’s biggest economic challenges.

“In addition to the pandemic, the country is also facing a climate crisis, a crisis of systemic racism and an economic crisis that has been building for fifty years,” Yellen said in her message. “I believe our department can play a major role in addressing each of these crises.”

She was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman elected to the position, at a ceremony performed outside on the East Wing entrance to the White House in view of the department Yellen will now lead. Yellen’s husband, George Akerlof, winner of the 2001 Nobel prize in economics, and their son Robert, also an economist, were present for the brief ceremony.

In her message to Treasury employees, Yellen said she would be conducting a virtual listening tour in the next few weeks to meet with employees to get their views on how the department can do a better job of addressing the crises facing the country.

“We must help the American people endure the final months of this pandemic by making sure they have roofs over their head and food on the table,” Yellen said. “Then, we must assist them in getting back to work safely.”

Yellen said it will be important to then turn to addressing what she called a K-shaped economy where some people have done very well with “wealth built on wealth while certain segments of the population fell further and further behind.”

Treasury said that Yellen spent her first day on the job meeting virtually with her advisers and career employees as well as getting an update on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan.

Yellen became the third of Biden’s Cabinet nominees to win Senate approval on a vote of 84-15 late Monday. All of the no votes came from Republican senators.

The administration has emphasized the need to get its nominees approved quickly given the threats facing the country from a global pandemic and a slumping economy.

Yellen is expected to play a key role in gaining congressional approval of Biden’s relief package, which is running into stiff opposition from Republicans who believe the price tag is too high.

Speaking on the Senate floor before Monday’s vote, Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted the former Federal Reserve chairwoman had bipartisan support.

Schumer said Yellen has a “breathtaking range of experience” and support for her nomination reflected “just how well suited she is to manage the economic challenges of our time ... particularly during this moment of economic crisis.”

Before the approval by the full Senate, Yellen had received unanimous backing from the Senate Finance Committee. Republicans on the panel said they had policy disagreements with Yellen and the Biden administration in such areas as raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, but believed it was important to allow Biden to assemble his economic team quickly.

At her confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee last week, Yellen argued that without prompt action the nation faced the threat of a “longer, more painful recession.” She urged quick action on the relief package that would provide an additional $1,400 in payments to individuals making below $75,000 annually as well as providing expanded unemployment benefits, further aid for small businesses and support for cities and states to prevent layoffs.

The plan also provides more support for vaccine production and distribution.

But many GOP senators have pushed back on the proposal. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told Yellen that Biden’s plan represented a “laundry list of liberal structural economic reforms.”

As Treasury secretary, Yellen, 74, will occupy a pivotal role in shaping and directing Biden’s economic policies. She enters the Treasury job after many years serving in other top economic jobs, including as the first woman to serve as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018.

An economist by training who was a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Yellen will represent the Biden administration in global financial affairs and lead a sprawling department whose responsibilities cover overseeing IRS tax collections, making policy on banking regulations and serving as the administration’s contact with Wall Street.

In her previous roles, Yellen developed an expertise in areas ranging from labor markets to international finance. Publicly, she frequently signaled concern about how economic policies affect ordinary people, especially disadvantaged communities.

She drew high marks for her stewardship at the Fed, where she employed record-low interest rates and massive bond buying, two policies begun by her predecessor Ben Bernanke, to support the economy as it struggled to emerge from a deep recession. She will now confront a new crisis brought on by a global pandemic.

Since leaving the Fed, Yellen has been a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institution, a liberal Washington think tank.

According to financial disclosure forms she provided during her confirmation, she collected more than $7 million in speaking fees during more than 50 in-person and virtual engagements over the past two years, including with many Wall Street firms. Yellen has agreed to recuse herself from decisions that would affect certain financial organizations."

In the medium-term, the global economy will be threatened by the knock-on effects of the coronavirus crisis, while geopolitical stability will be critically fragile over the next 5 to 10 years.

Environmental risks continue to threaten: they remain top risks by likelihood and impact in this year’s survey.

The Global Risks Report 2021 is the 16th edition of the Forum’s annual analysis and looks back at a year ravaged by a global pandemic, economic downturn, political turmoil and the ever-worsening climate crisis. The report explores how countries and businesses can act in the face of these risks.

Unsurprisingly, one of the big changes between this year and last, in terms of risks, has been brought about by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The risk posed by infectious diseases is now ranked at number one, while in 2020 it came in 10th place.

Environmental threats are among some of the greatest by likelihood and impact. Image: Global Risks Report 2021

Widespread effects

“The immediate human and economic costs of COVID-19 are severe,” the report says. “They threaten to scale back years of progress on reducing global poverty and inequality and further damage social cohesion and global cooperation.”

For those reasons, the pandemic demonstrates why infectious diseases hits the top of the impact list. Not only has COVID-19 led to widespread loss of life, it is holding back economic development in some of the poorest parts of the world, while amplifying wealth inequalities across the globe.

At the same time, there are concerns the fight against the pandemic is taking resources away from other critical health challenges - including a disruption to measles vaccination programmes.

Climate concerns

But despite the inescapable fallout from COVID-19, it is climate-related matters that make up the bulk of this year's risk list, which the report describes as “an existential threat to humanity.” Despite a drop in carbon emissions caused by lockdowns and disruption to international trade and travel, there are concerns that as economies start to recover, emissions will soar.

Unless global emissions fall, the threat of environmental crises remain high. Image: Global Risks Report 2021

The 2021 risks report draws upon data and insights from a wide array of respondents via the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Perception Survey. The survey was completed by over 650 members of the Forum’s diverse leadership communities.

There are all manner of risks facing the world. Image: Global Risks Report 2021

One of those communities is the Global Shapers – the Forum’s network of young people driving dialogue, action and change. For them, climate-related risks are seen as “the most likely and most impactful long-term risks.” They also sound a note of caution about the dangers of “youth disillusionment” around the world.

“They see personal risks as immediate threats, macro risks in the medium term and fundamental geopolitical risks in the long term,” the report says.

Among the short-term threats, which are likely to come to fruition within the next two years, are infectious diseases, livelihood crises, digital inequality and youth disillusionment.

As for medium-term risks in next three-to-five years, the Global Shapers identified asset bubble bursts, IT infrastructure breakdown, price instability and debt crises.

In the longer term, the community voiced concerns about weapons of mass destruction, state collapse, biodiversity loss and adverse technological advances.

Countering risks

Alongside the risks listed, the report reflects on responses to COVID-19 to draw lessons that could bolster global resilience.

These include formulating analytical frameworks, creating new forms of partnership and building trust through clear and consistent communication.

It also includes recommendations to help countries and businesses act, rather than react, in the face of risks."

In its 'The Global Risks Report 2021', the foundation states that the existing trends, like nationally focused agendas to stem economic losses, have been given fresh momentum by the COVID-19 crisis, and this could lead to risks including stagnation in advanced economies and lost potential in emerging and developing markets, among others.

The WEF, in its report, states that risks of job losses, a widening digital divide, disrupted social interactions, and abrupt shifts in markets could lead to dire consequences and lost opportunities for large parts of the global population. These consequences, which could manifest in the form of social unrest, political fragmentation, and geopolitical tensions, will shape the effectiveness of responses to other key threats of the next decade, climate change being paramount among them, along with cyberattacks and weapons of mass destruction, it points out.

""Among the highest likelihood risks of the next ten years are extreme weather, climate action failure, and human-led environmental damage; as well as digital power concentration, digital inequality and cybersecurity failure,"" the WEF report notes.

""Among the highest impact risks of the next decade, infectious diseases are in the top spot, followed by climate action failure and other environmental risks; as well as weapons of mass destruction, livelihood crises, debt crises, and IT infrastructure breakdown,"" it adds.

Out of these, employment and livelihood crises, widespread youth disillusionment, digital inequality, economic stagnation, human-made environmental damage, erosion of societal cohesion, and terrorist attacks are the most imminent threats to the world that could become critical in the next two years, the foundation says.

Terming the climate crisis as one of the most impactful risks, the WEF report cautions that although lockdowns worldwide caused global emissions to fall in the first half of 2020, evidence from the 2008-2009 financial crisis warns that emissions could bounce back.

""In the 5-10-year horizon, environmental risks such as biodiversity loss, natural resource crises, and climate action failure dominate; alongside weapons of mass destruction, adverse effects of technology and collapse of states or multilateral institutions,"" the WEF risk assessment says.

Talking about the economic impact of COVID-19, WEF notes in the report that the pandemic led to working hours equivalent to 495 million jobs being lost in the second quarter of 2020 alone, which in turn will immediately increase inequality. An uneven recovery poses a similar threat, it adds.

Economic risks can take 3-5 years before they fester into becoming global threats, the WEF says, listing asset bubbles, price instability, commodity shocks, and debt crises among such risks. This will be followed by geopolitical risks, including interstate relations and conflict, as well as resource geopolitisation, it further adds.

""Only 28 economies are expected to have grown in 2020. Nearly 60 per cent of respondents to the GRPS identified ""infectious diseases"" and ""livelihood crises"" as the top short-term threats to the world. Loss of lives and livelihoods will increase the risk of ""social cohesion erosion"", also a critical short-term threat identified in the GRPS,"" WEF says.

With COVID-19 driving digitisation in all walks of life, the Global Risk Report emphasises that digital inequality could become a critical short-term threat.

""A widening digital gap can worsen societal fractures and undermine prospects for an inclusive recovery. Progress towards digital inclusivity is threatened by growing digital dependency, rapidly accelerating automation, information suppression and manipulation, gaps in technology regulation, and gaps in technology skills and capabilities,"" WEF says.

Amid the economic, environmental, and employment challenges, the global community has largely neglected the risk of youth disillusionment which, WEF states, can become a critical threat to the world in the short-term. Hard-fought societal wins could be negated if the current generation lacks adequate pathways to future opportunities, and loses faith in today's economic and political institutions, the report warns.

""The response to COVID-19 offers four governance opportunities to strengthen the overall resilience of countries, businesses and the international community: (1) formulating analytical frameworks that take a holistic and systems-based view of risk impacts; (2) investing in high-profile ""risk champions"" to encourage national leadership and international co-operation; (3) improving risk communications and combating misinformation; and (4) exploring new forms of public-private partnership on risk preparedness,"" it further adds."

Turkish banks’ ability to borrow easily in international markets precluded an even sharper currency depreciation.
Eventually, the currency would have had to undergo a sharp correction once financial markets priced in Turkey’s country risk, in addition to the currency risk.
A country that runs out of FX reserves can, in principle, borrow on international markets and continue intervening to manage its own currency’s volatility.
Dollarization gained traction as the pandemic continued, with residents’ FX deposits accelerating particularly rapidly in early August – thus increasing banks’ FX liabilities to domestic households.","inflation, currency, depreciation, economic, reserves, turkeys, turkey, crisis, markets, banks, borrow, slowmotion, risk, fx",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"Turkey has maintained a floating exchange rate since 2001, when banking, sovereign debt, and balance-of-payments crises forced it to abandon the lira’s peg from a currency basket comprising the dollar and the euro.

Turkey adopted an inflation-targeting regime, under which policy rates should not be adjusted to engineer currency appreciation or depreciation, or in response to external shocks – such as COVID-19 – that lead to capital outflows.

Financial markets are forward-looking and know that inflation can be managed only through credible monetary policy. So, why didn’t markets price in a sharp depreciation of the lira much earlier? The answer lies in the importance of US monetary-policy spillovers for emerging markets. The abundant global dollar liquidity created by low US interest rates implied easy access to FX for emerging-market banks, including lower borrowing costs.

With this in mind, Turkey’s slow-moving crisis can be divided into three phases. During the pre-COVID phase, the lira was slowly depreciating as underlying structural problems went unaddressed and inflation targeting was not a high priority. Turkish banks’ ability to borrow easily in international markets precluded an even sharper currency depreciation.

The second phase of the crisis began when the pandemic hit in March this year. Turkey (like other countries) initially responded with monetary and fiscal accommodation. But expansionary monetary policy quickly reached its limits. The decline in interest rates below the double-digit inflation rate triggered dollarization, with domestic and foreign aversion to lira-denominated assets leading to sharper currency depreciation, which Turkey tried unsuccessfully to curb by selling roughly $130 billion of FX reserves.

But even if the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) had more FX reserves with which to support the lira, the outcome would have been no different. Eventually, the currency would have had to undergo a sharp correction once financial markets priced in Turkey’s country risk, in addition to the currency risk. A country that runs out of FX reserves can, in principle, borrow on international markets and continue intervening to manage its own currency’s volatility. In fact, in times of increased global uncertainty, it is cheaper to borrow in FX than in local currency.

But Turkey did not necessarily benefit from lower borrowing costs. As country risk increased and banks’ balance sheets deteriorated, it became harder to borrow externally in FX. With FX reserves being sold through banks to tame depreciation, and households increasing their FX deposits in response to rising inflation, the FX mismatch on banks’ balance sheets grew quickly. Dollarization gained traction as the pandemic continued, with residents’ FX deposits accelerating particularly rapidly in early August – thus increasing banks’ FX liabilities to domestic households."

For months now, signs of this crisis have surfaced through delays in payment of public salaries and pensions, and most recently, a decision by the Central Bank of Iraq to devalue the Iraqi dinar, pegged to the U.S. dollar, by 23%. The tension on the street is palpable. Despite the financial strain, the cabinet’s proposed budget is nearly the same as the last budget passed in 2019. However, there are increases in security-sector budgets, including that of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, the Counterterrorism Service (CTS) and the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) — a set of paramilitary groups that was established to help defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) in 2014. This makes paramilitaries, and the political entities associated with them, powerful economic actors on the eve of an economic crisis, when Iraq’s youthful and financially beleaguered population is most susceptible to clientelism.

Marsin Alshamary Former Brookings Expert Research Fellow - Middle East Initiative, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School

Decades of political science research has demonstrated that economic grievances — particularly when held by youth — can lead to violent outcomes, including civil war. In addition to fears that the violence will resurge, desperate economic times create opportunities for clientelism, defined here as the exchange of goods and services for electoral and political support. The protest movement of October 2019 demonstrated, among other things, that everyday protesters have long sought employment and financial stability. During a financial crisis and ahead of elections, this makes them easy targets for clientelistic political actors.

Iraq has no shortage of clientelistic actors, particularly ones that siphon off state resources (rather than private wealth) and allocate them to their supporters. The recent decrease in oil prices and state wealth overall would suggest, in theory, that political entities close to the state would suffer a reduction in power. However, among a population heavily reliant on state employment, a decrease in oil prices also makes citizens economically weaker. It may reduce the cost of buying off a vote, particularly among political parties and factions whose wealth, as described in the proposed budget, is unaffected.

The federal budget for 2021 (which is awaiting approval from parliament) has increased the budget allocation for the Ministry of Defense by 9.9%, the Ministry of Interior by 9.7%, the CTS by 10.1% and the PMF by 45.7% from the previous budget of 2019. The Iraqi government did not pass a budget in 2020, due to political turbulence at the time. Given that Iraqi ministries are generally held by particular political parties, this amounts to ensuring state wealth for a set of entrenched elites at a time when the average Iraqi citizen is financially strained. Moreover, and as a Brookings report demonstrates, some paramilitaries control border areas and reconstruction sites, which allows them to generate additional wealth from illicit markets and provide informal employment in moments of job scarcity.

These incentives are heightened near elections, which Prime Minster Mustafa Al-Kadhimi has proposed for June 2021 but are more likely to occur later in the year. As these elections approach, political actors — including the PMF — will increase their overtures towards the public and attempt to gain more supporters, as they did in the previous election of 2018. Indeed, it was the lack of employment opportunities, as well as the sudden onslaught of ISIS that pushed thousands of Iraqis to join the PMF as volunteers in 2014. Their ability to provide employment, particularly for youth, allowed their ranks to swell.

Civil society activists have criticized paramilitary groups for engaging in indiscriminate violence against protesters in 2019, as well as targeted intimidation and assassinations afterwards. In fact, one of the main demands of the protest movement is curbing the influence of paramilitaries by securing weapons solely in the hands of traditional security actors. This adversarial relationship between protesters and the paramilitaries, however, does not ensure that the average citizen will not be a target of clientelism. While long-time civil activists demanded electoral and political reform, everyday demonstrators, much like everyday Iraqis, demanded a secure economic future. The latter group is vulnerable to predation from well-resourced political parties.

Concerns about the longevity of Iraq’s paramilitary groups and their relationship to and control of the state cannot be divorced from a discussion about Iraq’s economic future and its ability to provide for its ever-growing population. In the latest Arab Barometer survey, nearly 80% of surveyed Iraqis described their country’s economic situation as “bad” or “very bad.” In the same survey, the most frequent response to Iraq’s most important challenge was either “economic” or “financial and administrative corruption.” An economically weak population is the greatest liability to the security and stability of a state. Economic insecurity disempowers citizens, nurtures corruption, and erodes democracy."

GDP grew 2.3 per cent in 2020, the data showed, making China the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

The world's second-largest economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from the coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense US-China relations on trade and other fronts. Beijing's strict virus curbs enabled it to largely contain the Covid-19 outbreak much quicker than most countries, while government-led policy stimulus and local manufacturers stepping up production to supply goods to many countries crippled by the pandemic have also helped fire up momentum.

Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 6.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday (Jan 18), quicker than the 6.1 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed the third quarter's solid 4.9 per cent growth.

GDP grew 2.3 per cent in 2020, the data showed, making China the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. And China is expected to continue to power ahead of its peers this year, with economists forecasting GDP to expand at the fastest pace in a decade at 8.4 per cent, according to a Reuters poll.

""The higher-than-expected GDP number indicates that growth has stepped into the expansionary zone, although some sectors remain in recovery,"" Xing Zhaopeng, economist at ANZ in Shanghai. ""Policy exiting will pose counter-cyclical pressures on 2021 growth.""

Backed by the strict virus containment measures and policy stimulus, the economy has recovered steadily from a steep 6.8 per cent slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of Covid-19 in the central city of Wuhan turned into a full-blown epidemic.

Asia's economic powerhouse has been fuelled by a surprisingly resilient export sector, but China's consumption - a key driver of growth - has lagged expectations amid fears of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.

Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made exports more expensive for overseas buyers.

Yet, underscoring the massive Covid-19 impact worldwide, China's 2020 GDP growth marked its weakest pace since 1976, the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy.

Overall, the slew of brightening economic data has reduced the need for more monetary easing this year, leading the central bank to scale back some policy support, sources told Reuters, but there would be no abrupt shift in policy direction, according to top policymakers.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.6 per cent in October-December, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 3.2 per cent rise and a revised 3.0 gain in the previous quarter.

Highlighting the weakness in consumption, retail sales fell 3.9 per cent last year, marking the first contraction since 1968, records from NBS showed. Growth in retail sales in December missed analyst forecasts and eased to 4.6 per cent from November's 5.0 per cent, as sales of garments, cosmetics, telecoms and autos slowed.

However, China's vast manufacturing sector continued to gain momentum, with industrial output rising at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.3 per cent last month from a year ago, hitting the highest since March 2019.

Lingering risks In 2021

Ning Jizhe, head of China's statistics bureau, told a briefing that there would be many favourable conditions to sustain China's economic recovery in 2021.

This year marks the start of China's 14th five-year plan, which policymakers see as vital for steering the economy past the so-called ""middle income trap"".

China still faces many challenges, not least the tensions between Beijing and Washington and how they would play out under the new US administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. As well, rising labour costs, the aging population, and a recent spike in credit defaults add to risks for an economy that is still trying to reduce a mountain of debt.

""We should be alert to the following problems in 2021: first the imbalance of economic recovery. Compared with investment and export, consumption is weak as a whole and has yet to return to normal levels,"" Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.

""The second is the problem of excessive and rapid credit contraction."""

“Facing the ongoing public health crisis of COVID-19 and the pandemic’s lasting effects on the global economy, policy-makers around the world must take this moment to reflect not just on the immediate recovery, but on how this time can be used to transform their economic systems,” wrote Forum Managing Director Saadia Zahidi.

“Growth and productivity alone are not enough, without addressing inequality and the environment. There is a need to shift policies so that economies make sustainability and social inclusion central to how they function,” she continued.

“This requires not just policies to manage environmental externalities or to build safety nets for people, but also those to spur investments that create the greener, fairer and people-focused markets of tomorrow.”

Where do we go from here?

Building back better must include rebuilding the global economy in a way that’s more equitable, sustainable and inclusive – here's how.

1. Reduce inequality and improve social mobility

“Inequality is rising even in those countries that have experienced rapid growth,” said Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab in the Global Social Mobility Index 2020.



And that was before COVID-19. The pandemic has exacerbated inequality, with the communities most affected by the dual economic and health crises already at a significant disadvantage. An estimated 88 to 115 million people could fall back into extreme poverty as a result, explained the Forum’s Future of Jobs 2020.

In the immediate term, emergency measures to enhance social safety nets remain critically important, as well as equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution to ensure no economies are left behind.

“Businesses must be a core stakeholder in the efforts around social mobility for their own employees, workers in their value chains and their communities broadly,” said the Global Social Mobility Index.

Specific actions include “a focus on promoting a culture of meritocracy in hiring; active participation in vocational and technical education programmes; providing timely and comprehensive reskilling and upskilling curricula to employees; and paying fair wages that allow employees to meet their basic needs,” along with diversity and inclusion initiatives.

2. Invest in a green recovery

“If economic recovery defaults to a reboot of pre-COVID-19 activities, societies will have missed an important window of opportunity to transition to a more inclusive and greener growth path,” said chief economists surveyed by the Forum.

“As economic policy interventions are transitioning from economic life-support measures to the stimulus phase, governments have a unique opportunity to influence the direction of economic progress through far-reaching innovation and investment strategies,” continued the report. “These new frontier markets include a range from green energy, ecotourism and the circular economy.”

For example, upgrading existing buildings to make them more energy efficient can help us tackle the economic and climate crises, explained Kim Fausing, President and CEO of Danfoss. This will not only reduce carbon emissions in a cost-effective way, but also create local jobs.

“According to the IEA, an estimated 9-30 jobs would be created for every million dollars invested in energy efficiency measures in the building sector and many of these jobs could be created quickly. As much as 60% of expenditure on home energy efficiency retrofits could be allocated to labour, activating local value chains and boosting the economy,” Fausing said.

3. Ensure markets are inclusive and work for all stakeholders

“Despite greater stability since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, even before the effects of the pandemic, the financial system displayed some fragility, with issues including increased corporate debt risk and unequal access to finance,” wrote the Forum’s Zahidi.

“Market concentration has been on an increasing trend in advanced economies, with large productivity and profitability gaps between the top companies and all others in each sector,” said last year’s special edition of the Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report. “Trade openness and the international movement of people have been on a declining trend since the financial crisis.”

To ensure markets remain stable in the long term, we must expand access and inclusion, transforming them from a shareholder model to a stakeholder model.

“Countries should rethink competition and anti-trust frameworks to lower barriers to entry and enhance competition and vibrant business models,"" continued Zahidi. “Countries must also prioritize financial stability while introducing incentives for companies to engage in long-term, sustainable and inclusive investments, focusing on new thresholds for ESG standards.""

Across the country, more than 10 million Americans are unemployed, 14 million renters are behind on payments, and 29 million adults – and at least 8 million children – are struggling with food insecurity. Because of pervasive systemic racism and inequality in our economy, the burdens of this economic crisis are hitting communities of color and other underserved families hardest. One in ten Black workers and one in eleven Latino workers are unemployed. Navigating through the current crisis and emerging stronger requires immediate action to provide equitable economic relief to working families everywhere.

Last week, President Biden unveiled a historic legislative package designed to change the course of the pandemic, get students back to school, give families and businesses a bridge to an economic recovery, and invest in advancing racial equity. His plan came on the heels of December’s bipartisan deal to provide a down payment on long-term economic relief for working families. Congress should finish the job by expeditiously passing the American Rescue Plan into law. But the American people cannot afford to wait for Congress to act – they need help and they need it now.

Today, the President is issuing an Executive Order that will launch an all-of-government effort to provide equitable emergency economic relief to working families, communities, and small businesses across the nation. The actions taken as part of this effort will provide relief to millions of American workers who have lost their jobs and had their hours or wages slashed through no fault of their own. They will help working families feed their children and keep a roof over their head. They will help ensure that unemployed Americans no longer have to choose between paying their bills and keeping themselves and their families safe from COVID-19 by clarifying that workers who refuse unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance. And, they will help more unemployed workers pay for training and college so they can find better jobs and succeed in an increasingly competitive job market.

That all-of-government effort will:

While additional congressional action is urgently needed to help working families through the remainder of the crisis, these emergency measures are important steps to give millions of Americans real relief during the pandemic. This executive order, combined with the President’s historic relief package and forthcoming jobs package will help Americans persevere through the pandemic and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable recovery. The President is also recommending immediate action to improve the wages, benefits, and bargaining rights of federal workers and contractors.

COVID ECONOMIC RELIEF EXECUTIVE ORDER

Address the Growing Hunger Crisis Facing 29 Million Adults — And As Many As 12 Million Children. Across the country 1 in 7 households, and more than 1 in 5 Black and Latino households, report that their household is struggling to secure the food they need. In December, Congress bolstered food assistance programs and provided new funding for food banks and school and child care meals. But these measures alone will not solve the growing hunger crisis in America. As part of his American Rescue Plan proposal, President Biden is calling on Congress to provide additional support to ensure that all Americans, regardless of background, have access to healthy, affordable groceries by extending the 15% Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit increase, investing $3 billion to help women, infants and children get the food they need, and other key steps. The President is also asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to consider taking the following steps to provide nutrition assistance to working families, including to:

Increase access to nutritious food for millions of children missing meals due to school closures. Established under Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) connects low-income families with kids with food dollars equivalent to the value of the school meals missed due to COVID-related school closures. To date, the program has only allowed P-EBT benefit amounts up to $5.70 per child per school day and many households have had trouble claiming benefits. To address these concerns and expand needed relief, the President is asking USDA to consider issuing new guidance increasing P-EBT benefits by approximately 15% to accurately reflect the costs of missing meals and make it easier for households to claim benefits. For instance, this action could provide a family with three children more than $100 of additional support every two months.

Allow larger emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program allotments for the lowest-income households. Congress authorized emergency increases to SNAP benefits to help address food insecurity during the pandemic. So far, those benefit increases have not been made available to all of the lowest income households. USDA will consider issuing new guidance that would allow states to increase SNAP emergency allotments for those who need it most. This would be the first step to ensuring that an additional 12 million people get enhanced SNAP benefits to keep nutritious food on the table.

Congress authorized emergency increases to SNAP benefits to help address food insecurity during the pandemic. So far, those benefit increases have not been made available to all of the lowest income households. USDA will consider issuing new guidance that would allow states to increase SNAP emergency allotments for those who need it most. This would be the first step to ensuring that an additional 12 million people get enhanced SNAP benefits to keep nutritious food on the table. Update food assistance benefits to reflect the true cost of a basic healthy diet. More than 40 million Americans count on SNAP to help put food on the table. Currently, however, USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan, the basis for determining SNAP benefits, is out of date with the economic realities most struggling households face when trying to buy and prepare healthy food. As a result, the benefits fall short of what a healthy, adequate diet costs for many households. Therefore, as directed by the 2018 Farm Bill, the President will ask USDA to consider beginning the process of revising the Thrifty Food Plan to better reflect the modern cost of a healthy basic diet.

Ensure Equitable and Effective Delivery of Direct Payments. As the President fights to get Americans the full $2,000 in direct payments they deserve, his administration is also working to ensure that all those who are eligible receive their full payments. Many Americans faced challenges receiving the first round of direct payments and as many as eight million eligible households did not receive the payments issued in March. In December, Congress passed legislation that would provide Americans with $600 in stimulus. The President’s American Rescue Plan proposes an additional $1,400 per-person payments to ensure that households get the support they need to help pay bills, put food on the table, and support small businesses and their communities. While Treasury and career staff at the IRS have worked tirelessly to deliver two rounds of payments in the midst of a pandemic, the work is far from over. To ensure equitable and effective delivery of direct payments and focus on getting relief to eligible individuals who have not received the financial assistance to which they are entitled, the President is asking the Department of Treasury to consider taking a series of actions to expand and improve delivery of Economic Impact Payments including establishing online tools for claiming their payments, working to make sure that those who have not yet accessed their funds get the relief they deserve, and analyzing unserved households to inform additional outreach efforts.

Guarantee that No American Has to Choose Between Paying Their Bills and Keeping Themselves and Their Families Safe from COVID-19. In 2019, 43% of American households reported having at least one member with pre-existing conditions, many of whom may have a heightened risk of serious illness or death if they contract COVID. President Biden believes that workers should have the right to safe work environments and that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own or their families’ health. As one of many measures to help keep workers and their families’ safe throughout the pandemic, the President is asking the Department of Labor to consider clarifying that workers have a federally guaranteed right to refuse employment that will jeopardize their health and if they do so, they will still qualify for unemployment insurance.

Help Families, Workers and Small Businesses Access Relief Resources Quickly, Easily and Equitably through Coordinated Benefit Delivery Teams. During the pandemic government programs have provided much needed support to help tens of millions of Americans pay rent, mortgages and other bills, get the food they need, and access healthcare. However, critical support does not always reach the people who need it: families struggle to navigate complicated eligibility rules while over 20% of Earned Income Tax Credits go unclaimed; many small businesses in communities of color cannot easily access loans; and according to one survey less than 40% of service workers who were laid off or furloughed at the height of pandemic closures actually received timely unemployment benefits due to system failures as applications surged. At the same time, an estimated 47% of children live in households that have trouble covering usual expenses such as food, housing, and medical care. The stakes are too high and too many families are in need for people not to get the relief that they are entitled to. The Biden-Harris Administration is establishing a network of benefit delivery teams and a coordination structure across federal and state administered programs to reduce the time and burden to access urgent support that provides greater stability and builds towards an equitable recovery.

PROTECTING AND EMPOWERING FEDERAL WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS

The federal government should only award contracts to employers who give their workers the pay and benefits they have earned; President Biden is today directing his administration to start the work that would allow him to issue an Executive Order within the first 100 days that requires federal contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage and provide emergency paid leave to workers.

He is also taking critical steps to protect and empower federal employees, who dedicate their careers to serving the American people. They keep us healthy, safe, and informed, and their work transcends partisan politics. They are health care workers who care for veterans, the elderly, and the disabled. They are expert scientists, medical doctors, and technicians who maintain world-class standards, prevent and combat the spread of infectious diseases, and save countless lives. They deliver our mail, run our national parks, keep our federal buildings up and running, help protect us against climate change and environmental poisoning, and ensure that the law is applied faithfully and fairly. They are talented, hard-working, and inspiring Americans, worthy of the utmost dignity and respect. But, over the last four years, they’ve been undermined and demoralized. The President will sign an executive order taking steps to protect and empower federal employees who are so essential to this country. It:

Restores collective bargaining power and worker protections by revoking Trump Executive Orders 13836, 13837, and 13839. It goes further to direct agencies to bargain over permissible, non-mandatory subjects of bargaining when contracts are up for negotiation so that workers have a greater voice in their working conditions.

Eliminates Schedule F, which undermines the foundations of the civil service.

Spain’s economy shrank 11% in 2020, according to data released on Friday by the National Statistics Institute (INE). This is the biggest contraction since the days of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.

This dismal figure is a result of the restrictions imposed last year to curb the spread of the coronavirus, particularly the 94 days of strict home confinement that nearly brought the economy to a halt between March and June. Economic output fell 17.8% in the second quarter, and even though there was some recovery during the second half of the year, it was not enough to make up for the damage.

During the first six months of the year, government spending was practically the only engine of economic activity

Output grew by a historic 16.4% in the third quarter after the country emerged from lockdown, but the second and third waves of the pandemic reduced this growth to 0.4% in the last three months of the year, according to INE data.

This growth saved the economy from a full-blown recession, but while the most optimistic forecasts hold that Spain will be back at pre-pandemic levels in late 2022, most experts believe that the summer of 2023 is a more realistic date.

The Spanish government, led by a center-left coalition of the Socialist Party (PSOE) and Unidas Podemos, had estimated a GDP contraction of 11.2% in 2020, and it is now forecasting a 7.2% rebound in 2021 without factoring in the impact of European recovery funds.

If Spain is able to successfully manage and invest the nearly €30 billion in reconstruction aid pledged by Brussels for this year, the economy could grow by as much as 9.8%, according to the executive’s estimates.

Services and tourism

Statistics clearly show that the brunt of the impact last year was felt by the services sector, particularly activities related to hospitality. Mobility restrictions ravaged the tourism industry, which is normally a driver of economic growth that accounts for nearly 14% of GDP. International arrivals sank from a record 85 million in 2019 to 20 million in 2020, leading to business closures across the spectrum of the tourism sector, from hotels to bars, restaurants and retail stores that made a living from sales to visitors.

This in turn had an impact on the job market, especially in regions that are highly dependent on tourism such as the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, where unemployment rose above the national average.

The effects of the tourism collapse were compounded by a slowdown in exports, and by a drop in domestic demand fueled by uncertainty about the future as many workers were laid off or furloughed.

Public spending

During the first six months of the year, government spending was practically the only engine of economic activity. Public spending reached historical highs as the executive sought to address the health and economic crises, and this effort will be reflected in higher public debt and deficit levels.

Mirroring similar action across Europe, the Spanish government launched a stimulus plan in March to protect households and businesses. A leading measure was the ERTE job retention scheme, which helped companies reduce costs while avoiding layoffs.

The move has kept Spain’s jobless rate for 2020 at 16.1%, as furloughed workers are not counted as unemployed. The scheme has just been extended for a fourth time until May 31. The government also introduced aid programs for businesses, including access to state-backed loans through the state-owned bank ICO.

All of these measures have helped cushion the tremendous blow delivered by the coronavirus crisis, but they have not prevented 2020 from being the worst year for the Spanish economy since the end of the Civil War in 1939.

Gross domestic product in Latin America’s second-biggest economy tumbled by 8.5% last year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the estimate issued by national statistics agency INEGI. The fall was slightly shallower than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for an 8.8% decline.

Still, the contraction was the sharpest since 1932 during the Great Depression, data published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) show. And the economy has recently faced fresh headwinds due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.

During the second half of 2020, the economy made up much of the ground lost to the pandemic, and an unexpectedly robust performance in the October-December period helped lift the peso against the dollar early on Friday.

But the economy remains a major challenge for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose efforts to strengthen the state’s hand in the energy market have led to disputes with businesses and upset Mexico’s allies, chilling investment.

The second quarter bore the brunt of economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, before a sharp increase in infections towards the end of 2020 led to renewed commercial restrictions in the Mexico City metropolitan area before Christmas.

That is expected to dent the recovery in early 2021, which has seen deaths from coronavirus hitting record levels. Lopez Obrador himself contracted COVID-19 this month.

On Friday, Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said a target of 4.6% economic growth in 2021 looked attainable, depending on the speed of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines. [L1N2K42W0]

During the final three months of 2020, GDP advanced by 3.1% from the previous quarter in adjusted terms, beating the prediction for 2.8% growth seen in a Reuters poll.

Nikhil Sanghani, an economist at Capital Economics, said the figures for the fourth quarter meant that Mexico had recouped more than 70% of its losses from the first half of 2020.

“However, the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases will cause the recovery to grind to a halt in Q1,” he said.

A breakdown of the unadjusted 2020 GDP figures showed manufacturing took the biggest hit last year. Secondary activities, which encompass factory output, fell by 10%, while tertiary activities, which include services, declined by 7.7%.

By contrast, primary activities such as farming, fishing and forestry, rose by 2.0% from 2019, the data showed.

The latest data also showed that 2020 was the second year running in which the economy went backwards. In 2019, the economy shrank by 0.1% in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.

Manufacturing activity has bounced back quickly from the depths of the slump, but companies are still wary about investing in new factories, buildings and machinery.

In the ten months through October, which is the latest data available, gross fixed investment was down by 19.5% compared with the same period in 2019, INEGI data show.

Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos said in a client note that the outlook remained challenging for Mexico, though the rollout of a vaccination program would help the recovery.

“Firmer U.S. growth, stronger terms of trade, and additional moderate monetary policy easing should leverage the recovery,” Ramos said. “With the better than expected fourth quarter 2020 print we now expect real GDP growth to firm to 4.0% in 2021.”"

Malaysia’s economic contraction quickened again in the fourth quarter, as a fresh virus wave late in 2020 helped drive the economy to its worst annual showing since the Asian financial crisis.

Gross domestic product shrank 3.4% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its third straight contraction and a deeper decline than the -3.1% figure analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting. The economy contracted 5.6% for all of 2020, its worst performance since 1998 and below the government’s projection of -3.5% to -5.5%.

The data are “an undoubtedly downbeat print to end the year of 2020 on a challenging note,” said Wellian Wiranto, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp in Singapore. With difficulties continuing into the early part of this year, “the market would inadvertently see today’s GDP data as one big signal that Bank Negara Malaysia may have to ease in March rather than wait for any more ‘confirmatory’ data.”

Central bank governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said Thursday that monetary policy remains appropriate and accommodative after the bank cut its policy rate by 125 basis points last year to fight the recession. Still, she added, the central bank has room to provide further support to the economy if needed.

Malaysian stocks fluctuated after the data, with the benchmark index gaining 0.2% at the close at 12:30 p.m. The market was only open for a half-day Thursday ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The ringgit was unchanged at 4.0445 against the dollar.

Loosening Curbs

The worst may be over — at least for now — as Malaysia allowed the retail sector to resume operations Wednesday, following a month-long lockdown that’s estimated to have cost the economy 700 million ringgit ($173 million) a day.

The government said it would gradually reopen the economy even as the country remains under a state of emergency, seeking a balance that will protect lives while ensuring that economic activity continues.

The loosened restrictions came into effect after health officials estimated daily virus cases peaked at the end of January. The nation added 2,764 new cases Tuesday — the smallest number since Jan. 11 — and Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said infections may show a downward trend by the time the lockdown is slated to end Feb. 18. The tally rose to 3,288 cases Wednesday.

The government last month unveiled a 15 billion ringgit package to help the economy weather the impact from the recent surge in Covid cases. The plan, which includes cash support to the poor, tax breaks and wage subsidies, will be funded through a reallocation of existing funds and not via fresh spending.

Fourth-quarter Slowdown

So far, however, 2021 is off to a slow start with most of the country under lockdown.

The second wave of infections “will see the economy shrink much more sharply this quarter,” Alex Holmes, an Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note after the GDP release. Even if the lockdown isn’t extended beyond next week, “high infections mean social distancing will remain a drag for months to come.”

Other points from the briefing:

The fourth-quarter figure compares with the third quarter’s revised 2.6% year-on-year contraction. The economy shrank 0.3% in the October-December period from the previous three months on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared to an 18.2% gain in the previous quarter

The full-year contraction was slightly better than the 5.8% contraction that private analysts were expecting

Headline inflation averaged -1.2% in 2020, mainly reflecting weak oil prices. For 2021, it’s expected to average higher, Nor Shamsiah said

The governor declined to give a fresh estimate for 2021 GDP — which the central bank previously forecast at 6.5%-7.5% growth — saying it will be addressed next month.

“Despite the recent deterioration in activity, we believe Malaysia is relatively well positioned for a recovery,” said Joseph Incalcaterra, chief Asean economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong, who nevertheless expects the central bank to cut rates at its March meeting.

“A strong degree of fiscal support in 2020 prevented a sharp deterioration in the labor market,” he said, while “an advantageous mix of semiconductor, machinery, and commodity production should translate into robust export growth in 2021.”"

Feb 11 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s economy fell at a faster than expected clip in the fourth quarter, as stricter coronavirus curbs crimped consumption and slowed the pace of recovery.

Gross domestic product contracted 3.4% year-on-year in the October-December period, the central bank said on Thursday, falling for a third straight quarter and faster than the 3.1% decline forecast in a Reuters poll.

Malaysia’s full-year economic performance fell 5.6% in 2020, the worst annual performance since the 7.4% decline in 1998 during the Asian Financial Crisis, according to data from the department of statistics.

“Going into 2021, growth will rebound, supported by a pickup in global demand and normalisation in domestic economic activities,” Bank Negara Malaysia governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said during a virtual news conference.

Malaysia’s economic performance will likely continue to be weighed by the pandemic, especially after a recent surge in cases prompted the government to impose a second lockdown until at least Feb. 18, Capital Economics said in a note.

“The risks are to the downside. Our current assumption is that Malaysia will bring the virus largely under control by next quarter, but if that fails, we will have to cut our forecasts further,” said Alex Holmes, Asia economist with Capital Economics.

Capital Economics expects full-year 2021 growth to come in at 7%.

Malaysia’s cumulative coronavirus infections shot past 250,000 on Wednesday, including 923 deaths.

“There have been many developments, the resurgence of COVID and also progress with the vaccines... but importantly, we still expect growth in 2021 to recover,” Nor Shamsiah said.

She said monetary policy will “remain accommodative in an environment of modest prices,” and that the central bank has sufficient policy space to provide further support if needed.

Last month, the central bank left its overnight policy rate at a record low of 1.75%. It cut its key rate by 125 basis points last year to prop up the coronavirus-hit economy.

The trade-reliant economy had shown tentative signs of a rebound in the third quarter, driven by improving global demand. Full year exports fell 1.4%, though shipments began recovering in the last four months of 2020.

The central bank said it expects inflation to trend higher this year, after 10 straight months of decline largely due to low retail fuel prices.

Sudan said Sunday it was ditching its fixed exchange rate and adopting a managed float, in line with an IMF programme but at the risk of fanning already-smouldering popular discontent.

It is the latest in a series of reforms by the joint military-civilian government that has ruled Sudan since mass protests led to the military ouster of strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.

The move aims to stem a rampant black market that has seen the local pound recently trade at around 400 to the dollar, while the official rate was fixed at 55 pounds to the greenback.

It is expected to shift the official rate toward black market levels -- sending prices higher even as citizens already grapple with an inflation rate that topped 300 percent last month.

Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim urged people to tolerate the impact of the policy change, saying in a press conference that it ""will require a high patriotic spirit"" and ""cooperation"".

Sudan's central bank said in a statement the transitional government had decided on ""reforming and unifying the exchange rate system by applying a managed flexible exchange rate system"".

Closing the yawning gap between the official and black market rates is central to a reform programme agreed last year with the International Monetary Fund.

The US embassy in Khartoum said on Twitter that ""we welcome the Sudanese government's courageous decision to move forward today with exchange rate reform"".

""This decision will also help Sudanese companies and attract international investment as both local and foreign companies will no longer encounter difficulties doing business in Sudan because of the dual exchange rate.""

Washington recently removed Sudan from its state sponsors of terrorism blacklist, another move Khartoum hopes will unlock debt relief, aid and foreign investment.

- Cushioning the blow -

Sudan's economy was decimated by decades of US sanctions under Bashir, mismanagement and civil war, as well as oil-rich South Sudan's 2011 secession.

Protests have flared in recent weeks in several regions over skyrocketing prices, alongside bread and medicine shortages.

The central bank said its policy shift, which follows the recent appointment of a new cabinet tasked with tackling the economic crisis, is ""imperative"" to help achieve stability.

It is one of several painful IMF mandated reforms, which also include reducing costly subsidies, aimed at securing debt relief and attracting investment.

The finance minister and the central bank governor, Mohamed al-Fatih, said the exchange rate policy shift will be cushioned by international donors financing a project aimed at supporting poor families from Monday.

The programme offers $5 dollars per month each to around 80 percent of the country's 45 million people.

The central bank governor said Sudan has also begun applying a dual banking system, instead of solely Islamic banking, in a move allowing international banks to operate in the country.

The exchange rate policy shift comes amid concern that Sudan's level of foreign currency holdings are approaching exhaustion.

If the central bank is to be successful in drawing transactions away from the black market, then reserves need to stand at around $5 billion, Mohamed el-Nayer, a Sudanese economist, told AFP.

Authorities have not lately disclosed the level of reserves.

Asked if the country had enough reserves, Ibrahim replied that funds had lately been received, but did not specify the origin or amount.

But the recent shortages of bread as well as of fuel point to the possibility that foreign reserves are ""severely lacking"", Nayer said.

Bashir's fall nearly two years ago came after months of protests against his autocratic rule that were triggered by his cash-strapped government effectively trebling bread prices.

In October, Sudan signed a peace deal with rebel groups that observers hoped would end long-running conflicts in the country's far-flung regions.

Last month, the government approved this year's budget and it is aiming for inflation of 95 percent by end-2021.

The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 9.9% in 2020, as no sector of the economy was left unscathed by lockdowns and plummeting demand during the pandemic. It was the biggest fall in annual GDP since the Great Frost of 1709, when the economy shrank by 13%.

However, the latest figures showed the economy narrowly avoided a double-dip recession, with growth of 1% in the final quarter of the year, surpassing expectations earlier in the autumn for a renewed fall in GDP as the pandemic worsened. Looser Covid restrictions in the run-up to Christmas enabled the economy to grow at a monthly rate of 1.2% in December, after a 2.3% fall in November during the second English lockdown.

Far surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis, the annual drop in output caused by the Covid-19 emergency narrowly exceeded a 9.7% decline in 1921, when Britain was recovering from the first world war and the Spanish flu pandemic.

Pubs, bars and restaurants were able to recover some lost ground, and retail sales improved in December after the November lockdown ended and before tougher measures were imposed. Growth was also fuelled by a rise in healthcare activity, mainly because of coronavirus test-and-trace schemes across the UK.

Analysts said companies adapting to restrictions by shifting their working patterns and altering their business models – including a boom in online shopping, and pubs and restaurants operating takeaways – helped to keep the economy growing late in 2020 despite increasingly tough public health restrictions.

Output in the accommodation and food services sector – which includes hotels and restaurants – fell by a third in the fourth quarter overall but fared better than in the first lockdown, when the country came to a near standstill.

With looser coronavirus restrictions than last spring, output in the services sector – which makes up 80% of the economy – grew by 0.6%. Largely allowed to stay open, industrial production and manufacturing activity also grew, returning closer to pre-pandemic levels.

The UK economy shrank for two successive quarters in the first half of last year, meeting the technical definition of a recession. The economy shrank by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2020, when the pandemic first spread to the UK, before a record 19% fall in the subsequent quarter during the spring lockdown.

The economy then grew at a record 16.1% in the third quarter, fuelled by the summer reopening of the hospitality sector, before the second wave of the pandemic forced the launch of renewed restrictions. Economists forecast a renewed plunge in the opening months of 2021, meaning a drop in the fourth quarter of 2020 would have marked the first step into a double-dip recession, defined as two recessions following each other in quick succession.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the latest figures showed Britain’s economy had experienced a “serious shock” as a result of the pandemic. “While there are some positive signs of the economy’s resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses,” he said.

“That’s why my focus remains fixed on doing everything we can to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods. At the budget I will set out the next stage of our plan for jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the next phase of pandemic.”

Although the economy has avoided a double-dip recession, analysts said it was probably shrinking at the start of the year, with the toughest Covid lockdown restrictions since the first wave weighing down activity. The government is under mounting pressure to set out its roadmap for relaxing lockdown and fresh economic support measures for businesses and workers reeling from a year of disruption.

Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said Britain had recorded the highest death toll in Europe and among the worst declines of any major economy. “Businesses can’t wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand in hand with health restrictions,” she said.

Britain’s annual economic decline was the worst in the G7. GDP fell by 3.5% in the US, by 5% in Germany, 8.3% in France and 8.9% in Italy. The Canadian economy is forecast to have shrunk by 5%, and Japan’s by about 5.6%. However, the UK fared better than Spain, where the economy collapsed by 11% last year."

The GameStop stock saga rose into a kind of social movement, carried in large part by emotions that are still raw from the 2008 financial crisis.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Anger from the Great Recession is still very raw for a lot of people. One place that is wildly apparent - the Reddit community that spawned the GameStop trading frenzy. Many feel that how it all unfolded is just the latest example of the deck being stacked against them. And this is a chance to fight back. NPR's Kat Lonsdorf has more.

KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: James McCombs was 13 in 2008.

JAMES MCCOMBS: I was old enough to know what was going on and old enough to hear my parents' conversations, old enough for them to tell me that, you know, the college fund was gone.

LONSDORF: That college fund had been tied up in the stock market. And, well, McCombs got into an expensive college in New York but couldn't afford it, so he ended up taking out loans to attend his state school in Nebraska. But he dropped out, overwhelmed by the cost. He's still paying off those loans. And like a lot of people who lived through the financial crisis, he resents how it threw his life off track.

MCCOMBS: Basically, my future got mortgaged. It got put on hold. And that happened all over the country.

LONSDORF: McCombs invested a small amount in some of the popular Reddit stocks weeks ago, hoping for quick profit. But when individual investors like him managed to inflict some serious pain on hedge funds, it wasn't about the money anymore.

MCCOMBS: Now we have an opportunity to take it back if we all make the conscious choice to be a part of fixing it and changing it.

LONSDORF: He's holding on to his stock even as the price plummets. The subreddit WallStreetBets, where this all began, has ballooned in the past few weeks to nearly 9 million subscribers. And while it started as an investment forum, it's recently also morphed into a movement, riding a giant wave of unresolved anger from the Great Recession. There are thousands of posts from users saying that this is their chance to hurt the system with its own game, even if it didn't start that way.

ERIN CAPARELLI: It looked like an opportunity, you know, to maybe double your money.

LONSDORF: Erin Caparelli is a delivery driver in Central Florida. She follows WallStreetBets on Reddit and threw a couple hundred dollars into GameStop last month. It was her first investment ever. But then the frenzy took over, and investing apps like Robinhood suspended trading.

CAPARELLI: As soon as that happened, it really - the whole sentiment changed to where, like, this is messed up. Like, the game is rigged. It's against us.

LONSDORF: It brought back a lot of raw emotion from a decade ago, and Caparelli's investment became a protest.

CAPARELLI: It always falls back onto the little guy. We're not too big to fail. We can easily fail.

LONSDORF: She's not selling either. If this all feels vaguely familiar, it kind of is.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST AMBIENCE)

LONSDORF: A lot of the same rhetoric was used by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011.

NELINI STAMP: It's obviously different tactics, but I think it comes from a same head (ph) sentiment of, like, enough is enough.

LONSDORF: Nelini Stamp camped out with Occupy in New York's Zuccotti Park from Day 1 and stayed all three months until protesters were cleared by police. She says, sure, this is very capitalist, while Occupy was anything but. Still, though, she respects the problems it's shining a light on.

STAMP: It just kind of shows that, like, not only have we not solved for all of the issues that came out of the 2007, 2008 financial crisis, but we're building upon them now.

LONSDORF: She points to all the ways the pandemic has exacerbated inequality - the loss of jobs, housing, income - while Wall Street has hit record highs.

Laurel Weldon wrote the book ""When Protest Makes Policy: How Social Movements Represent Disadvantaged Groups.""

LAUREL WELDON: Often, a kind of social protest is aimed at disruption alone. It's aimed at expressing a grievance. And in doing so, I mean, you have to think that in some senses, this has been a successful protest.

LONSDORF: There's definitely been disruption, and it's getting attention from both the left and the right. Weldon says that's probably because more and more people feel like wealth is out of reach.

WELDON: It's really picking up on this anti-financial elite, stick-it-to-the-man ethos that is, I think, quite a powerful current in contemporary American society.

LONSDORF: A current that's now found its way into the very financial systems it's been fighting against.

This is how a negative rate policy works alongside some of its potential pitfalls:

WHY HAVE SOME CENTRAL BANKS ADOPTED NEGATIVE RATES?

During the global financial crisis of 2008-09, many central banks cut interest rates close to zero.

With their economies still struggling in the years that followed, policymakers in the euro zone, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Japan allowed rates to fall to slightly below 0%.

The coronavirus pandemic has now put pressure on central banks to pump even more stimulus into their economies.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, which had managed to push up borrowing costs in recent years, cut rates back to just above zero but several policymakers have expressed resistance to going further.

The BoE cut its key rate to a record low of 0.1% in March 2020 and has doubled its bond purchase target since the start of the pandemic to support the economy.

However, most economists polled by Reuters think it is unlikely to cut rates below zero this year, largely because the fast rollout of Britain's vaccination programme has raised the prospect of an economic recovery.

There have also been divisions over negative rates within the Monetary Policy Committee, with the internal members, headed by Governor Andrew Bailey, stressing risks and uncertainties, while the external members have sounded more open to the idea.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Under a negative rate policy, banks and other financial institutions are required to pay interest for parking excess cash -- beyond what regulators say they must keep on hand for safety reasons -- securely with the central bank.

Avoiding the charges is an incentive for banks to use their money to lend more to businesses and consumers, helping growth.

The ECB introduced negative rates in 2014. Its deposit rate is currently -0.5%.

The Bank of Japan went negative in 2016, mostly to prevent a strengthening yen from hurting its export-heavy economy. The BOJ uses aggressive asset purchases to guide short-term rates to -0.1% and the long-term rate to about zero.

In December, however, it said it planned to examine more effective ways to achieve its inflation target amid growing concern among policymakers over the diminishing return and rising cost of prolonged easing. read more

WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS?

Negative central bank rates lower borrowing costs for businesses and households.

Advocates say they also help weaken a country's currency by making it a less attractive investment than other currencies. That can give exporters a competitive advantage but boosts inflation by pushing up import costs.

But negative rates also narrow the margin that financial institutions earn from lending -- something BoE officials have previously said could prove counter-productive, hurting banks and reducing the flows of credit to the economy.

The ECB and the BOJ have sought to reward banks that use their credit lines, recognising the need for incentives to boost lending rather than just punishing them for parking their money.

BoE Governor Bailey said in January that rates close to and below zero changed the ""whole calculus of how the banking system works.""

Lenders in Britain make most of their profits from the difference between the rates they charge for their lending and what they pay for deposits, and bankers said negative rates could force them to introduce more retail banking fees. read more

HSBC said in October that rock-bottom and sub-zero rates in countries where it operates meant it had to consider more charges.

British lenders would probably charge large corporate depositors first and consumers as a last resort.

In Switzerland, big banks initially did not pass negative rates on to private and smaller corporate clients. But five years on, nearly all Swiss banks have passed on some charges to corporate and individual customers with large cash balances.

Higher banking fees could also limit how low negative rates could go -- depositors can avoid being charged negative rates or fees on their deposits by choosing to store banknotes instead.

Last year's 6.1 per cent contraction was the worst since a 7.6 per cent decline during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and officials said they expect the economy to expand at a much slower pace than initially predicted in 2021.

The downgrade - to 2.5 to 3.5 per cent growth from an previous estimate of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent - came despite a slight improvement in the final three months of the year.



""It has rebounded from the previous quarter due to the government's stimulus package that boosted spending,"" Danucha Pichayanan, the secretary general of the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC), said at a news conference.

Although the kingdom was largely spared the worst of the virus, pandemic-spurred partial lockdowns have hit the economy hard.

Thailand has registered more than 24,500 COVID-19 cases, with a jump of about 20,000 infections since late last year, after a second wave that stemmed from the country's largest seafood market.

Some 40 million tourists had been expected to arrive in 2020, but as international travel ground to a trickle, their absence hammered the country's services sector, bruising entertainment, retail, hotels and restaurants.



The kingdom's freefalling economy has been a factor in the youth-led protest movement that is calling for premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha's resignation, constitutional reform and changes to the once-untouchable monarchy.

Asked about the political climate, Danucha implied it was delivering a further blow.

""The Thai economy relies on investment and exports. The political situation will affect investors' confidence,"" he said.

The country's economy was struggling even before the pandemic, which laid bare the deep inequality between the haves and have-nots of Thai society.

In response to the pandemic slump, the government implemented a record, 1.9 trillion baht (US$59.7 billion) stimulus package, cash handouts and tax incentives.

Further economic improvements will depend on managing the pandemic and boosting visitors, Danucha said.

The greatest threat to the United States economy continues to be containing the spread of Covid-19. President Biden’s top economic priority is to get to the other side of this crisis by ramping up the production and distribution of the vaccine, supporting businesses and households that need it most, and launching an inclusive, equitable recovery.

Need for Action – Monday’s CBO Report

On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that without additional government spending, the unemployment rate will remain above its pre-pandemic projections until 2024. This means millions would be unemployed for years after the health threat has lessened, unless we take action.

The projections on economic growth relative to the beginning of the pandemic also underscore the urgency of additional action. While the CBO forecasts that growth in gross domestic output will rebound in 2021, back up to 3.7 percent for the year, that pace would not—absent additional action—return GDP to potential until 2025. CBO’s forecasts include the December relief package but not President Biden’s proposed American Relief Plan.

Some people took the CBO’s projections for growth in 2021 as a sign that we can wait to see whether additional fiscal relief is needed. But in fact, what the CBO is projecting is dire: around 7 million people out of work in 2021 whom CBO thought before the pandemic would be working. That’s dire – and a call to immediate action, not calm, not wait-and-see.

The Pandemic’s Toll on American Workers and Families

In addition to CBO’s macroeconomic estimates of when the economy will return to pre-pandemic employment and growth trends, the current crisis is generating deeply inequitable outcomes for American families. Almost a year into the pandemic, almost 11 million workers remain unemployed and around 4 million have been unemployed for six months or longer. More than 2 million women have left the labor force, many in the wake of school closures and challenges with child care. These job losses have been concentrated among lower wage workers.

In addition, more than 15 million adults are behind on rental payments, nearly 24 million adults — and as many as 12 million children — are struggling with food insecurity, and more than 80 million adults are having trouble covering usual household expenses. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic crisis have brought tens of millions of Americans to the brink of financial ruin through no fault of their own.

The Economics of the American Rescue Plan

It does not have to be this way. In designing the American Rescue Plan, President Biden tasked his team with building a bottom-up plan that provides resources for our highest priority needs: getting shots in arms, opening schools, and providing relief to the workers, families, and small businesses that need it most.

That bottom-up approach also makes sense top-down, looking at the economy as a whole and the challenges that yesterday’s CBO report laid bare: a labor market that is projected to recover too slowly and economic output that fails to get back to pre-pandemic expectations soon enough.

Two independent analyses of the American Rescue Plan have made this clear.

First, Moody’s Analytics projects that the President’s Plan will bring the economy to full employment a full year earlier than a baseline without additional fiscal stimulus. This is significant because it’s a difference of 4 million jobs in 2021. But it’s also important because history shows that lower-income workers – and Black and brown workers – see the largest wage gains when the economy is at full employment.

Second, leading Brookings Institution economists projected that, if the President’s plan is enacted, GDP would reach CBO’s pre-pandemic projection at the end of 2021, while CBO says we won’t reach potential GDP until 2025 without additional economic relief. As they conclude, “In all, with the $1.9 trillion package, we project that cumulative real GDP between 2020 and 2023 would end up close to its pre-pandemic projection.” Simply put, the ARP gets the overall economy back on track.

Of course, economic projections are uncertain, particularly in the midst of a pandemic that is making estimates of potential supply and the path of demand highly variable. This is all the more so because the steps we take or don’t take now can shape the course of the pandemic and, thus, the economic recovery to come. But despite this uncertainty, there’s a lot we do know about how to guide policy:

We know that prolonged periods of high unemployment and low labor force participation have scarring effects on the labor market and on working people.

We know we are living through a K-shaped recovery, in which those at the top are continuing to thrive, while those at the bottom are struggling to make ends meet.

We know that getting back to full employment, as quickly as possible, will make a major difference in the lives of tens of millions of people, particularly those most at risk of being left behind.

We know the costs of aggressive action today are especially low, with real interest rates and real debt service payments as a share of GDP at historic lows.

Unique crises call for unique approaches. Our economic strategy in response to this pandemic-induced economic crisis is centered around the belief that the costs of inaction are far higher than the costs of acting too aggressively. We should not wait for years for the economy to return to full employment and get the economy back to pre-pandemic expectations. Relying on the usual tools and the usual approaches to determine how much government action we need is a recipe to ensure that we come out of this crisis weakened and that we do not take this opportunity to build back better. We cannot afford to make this mistake."

The UK’s poor economic performance was the result of worse outbreaks of coronavirus than in most other countries, resulting in longer lockdowns and in households saving more of their income.

The ONS, however, said most of the UK’s poor performance relative to other countries was genuine rather than a statistical aberration.
​Letter in response to this article:Mashing output and rates of growth is elementary / From Kit McMahon, London, UK","economy, suffers, quarter, economic, countries, public, output, biggest, cent, uk, uks, performance, drop, 300",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"The UK economy recorded its worst economic performance for more than 300 years in 2020 as it reeled from the initial shock of the coronavirus crisis before staging a better than expected recovery later in the year.

Official figures on Friday showed that the UK produced 9.9 per cent fewer goods and services last year than in 2019, a contraction worse than the 1921 slump after the first world war and Spanish flu — and almost as bad as the contraction in great frost in 1709 when the UK was an agricultural economy.

But as companies and households learnt to live with Covid-19 lockdowns, economic performance improved during the year and Britain’s economy grew 1 per cent in the final quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.

The improved data in the fourth quarter encouraged Rishi Sunak, who said it showed “positive signs of the economy’s resilience over the winter”, adding in a BBC interview that there was a case for “cautious optimism” from the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.

But in a warning that the March 3 Budget would not be just another giveaway, Sunak stressed that he needed to be “open and honest” with the public about “the need for sustainable public finances in the future”, hinting this would mean tax rises in due course.

The UK’s economic performance in the Covid-19 crisis still looks weak by international standards, with output in the final quarter of last year 7.8 per cent below the pre-pandemic peak — twice the decline seen in Germany and three times that in the US.

The UK’s poor economic performance was the result of worse outbreaks of coronavirus than in most other countries, resulting in longer lockdowns and in households saving more of their income. On top of this, UK statisticians adopted different methods for measuring public sector output than other countries, which resulted in a larger recorded drop in output.

The ONS, however, said most of the UK’s poor performance relative to other countries was genuine rather than a statistical aberration. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said even excluding public services, the decline up to the third quarter of 2020 was “still one of the largest in the G7”.

The UK’s weakness in 2020 stemmed from a more than 20 per cent slump during the first lockdown. The latest lockdown is likely to cause another dip at the start of this year but economists think it will be more muted and followed by a period of rapid recovery.

Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “We look for a hefty 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter rebound in GDP in the second quarter, followed by a 2.2 per cent increase in the third.” That could mean a “faster recovery than in other European countries, where the vaccine rollout has been much slower”, he added.

During the pandemic, most households’ incomes have held up in what has been the worst recession in more than a century because the government has borrowed more £400bn to protect jobs and livelihoods. These schemes are set to be extended in Sunak’s Budget although economists still expect unemployment to rise from below 4 per cent before the pandemic to 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

The ONS also reported a widening goods trade deficit in the last three months of 2020, driven by rising EU imports as businesses prepared for the end of the transition period.

In December, the economy expanded 1.2 per cent compared with the previous month. Although November’s figure was revised up 0.3 percentage points, the economy shrank 2.3 per cent that month as England entered lockdown.

“Loosening of restrictions in many parts of the UK saw elements of the economy recover some lost ground in December, with hospitality, car sales and hairdressers all seeing growth,” said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics.

Services rebounded strongest, rising 1.7 per cent in December compared with November. The manufacturing sector grew for the eighth consecutive month, but output in the construction sector fell for the first time since the spring.

Jonathan Gillham, PwC chief economist, said the figures were not as bad as had been expected and showed that “from an economic perspective, we are becoming more adaptable to being locked down”.

The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review, released today, underscores our unsustainable engagement with nature and the urgent need to act.

Ending the decline in nature and thus reversing biodiversity loss will require us all to take action.

The global financial crisis of 2008 had catastrophic effects on all elements of society with very few economies left untouched. It resulted in a global recession that was the most severe since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This was caused by too much risk-taking in a seemingly flourishing economy; drawing down too many resources to extend business and profits with short-term gains; and policies, regulatory mechanisms and institutions that were simply too lax and ineffective. Millions of people lost their jobs, homes and livelihoods, and large amounts of their wealth disappeared overnight.

Out of the ashes of this crisis rose a new dawn for global finance, where greater scrutiny and oversight of banks and other financial institutions became the norm. Governments loosened fiscal policy more strategically to stimulate and support economies, but not to the detriment of society. International entities were established, such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which was set up by the G20 to monitor and make recommendations about the global financial system and avoid a cascading global economic collapse from happening ever again.

These lessons and responses from the financial world should be a stark warning for the current plight of our natural world. For decades, we have failed to manage our global portfolio of assets sustainably – that is the mix of produced, human and natural capital – as we have depleted our natural capital significantly. Estimates show that since the early 1990s, produced capital per person has doubled and human capital per person has increased by about 13% globally, while the stock of natural capital per person has declined by nearly 40%.

Just imagine, how would global financial markets react if 40% were wiped off balance sheets and countries’ GDPs were spiraling sharply downwards? They would take drastic collective action, unequivocally so, to avoid catastrophic impacts on the very fabric of life on this planet. Yet this is the very trajectory we are on at the moment when it comes to nature – but the required urgent action is conspicuous by its absence. By drawing down on our natural capital to such an extent, we are taking enormous and disproportionate risks, without regulatory mechanisms being universally applied. We are failing to invest in these assets even though they underpin the fundamental elements of every aspect of our lives.

Our health, livelihoods and economies depend on nature. As the Nature Risk Rising report found, more than half of the world’s GDP is highly or moderately dependent on nature. We are nearing irreversible tipping points and we will all pay a high price for not acting now. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought our dysfunctional relationship with nature into sharp focus, and has devastatingly demonstrated that we ignore nature – and its associated biodiversity – at our peril. While humanity has been prospering immensely in recent decades, this has come at a high cost to the natural world, with overfishing rampant, deforestation unabated and extinction rates of biodiversity 1,000 times higher than any time in human history.

We are even seeing global systems like the ocean, once thought to be inexhaustible and able to withstand anything humanity did to it, in serious trouble. Work by the WWF has estimated that the global ocean is a $24 trillion asset, and goods and services from coastal and marine environments amount to about $2.5 trillion each year – putting the ocean as the seventh largest economy in the world in terms of GDP. This is one of the planet’s key savings accounts from which we keep making only withdrawals, even though to continue in such a way can only lead to bankruptcy. We simply cannot afford to let this happen and the World Economic Forum’s Friends of Ocean Action is driving much-needed transformative change. It is time for significant reinvestment and protection of this and other global nature commons. It is time for us to invest in nature.

The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review, released today, underscores our unsustainable engagement with nature and the urgent need to act. It shines a clear light on the extent of the unsustainable relationship between humanity and nature. The Review shows that deep-rooted institutional failure, including short-termism, has led us to collectively fail to engage with nature sustainably, to the extent that our demands far exceed its capacity to supply us with the goods and services we all rely on. Yet we continue to enable and exacerbate this decline by subsidizing activities which are damaging nature, estimated to be around $4-6 trillion per year, and not bringing to bear the full force of governance and regulatory mechanisms desperately required to slow this unimaginable pace.

The Dasgupta Review makes clear that learning from the past is important, but that now is not the time to dwell on it. We must look forward, and the Review outlines the steps to take now to change this state of affairs. And we all have a role to play.

Ending the decline in nature and thus reversing biodiversity loss will require us all to take action. Changing our measures of success so that it includes the value of nature at the global, national, local and corporate levels; and moving to a measurement of stocks rather than flows will allow us to identify whether we are truly on a sustainable path to improved wellbeing. Our global financial system needs to be one in which measuring and managing dependencies, impacts and nature-related risks becomes the norm not the exception. A true understanding of the ecological impacts and consequences of our consumption and production patterns will encourage behaviour change, like opting for more sustainable diets and reducing waste.

Image: The Dasgupta Review/HM Treasury

We need everyone to feel empowered to make informed decisions and hold other actors to account who are taking decisions that deplete nature and sustainability on our behalf. Ask the right questions and demand transparency on the ecological impacts of supply chains and financial investments. One of the aims of the Dasgupta Review is just this: to make available the knowledge and language to discuss these problems and demand change. But we should not stop with one or two generations – we must henceforth include the natural environment in our children’s curricula. That a new qualification in natural history will be introduced in schools in the UK from next year is a promising step that should be emulated by other countries.

Each and every one of us is a steward of nature and has a responsibility to invest in and protect this most precious asset we all depend on. Government leaders have a historic opportunity to safeguard nature through smart policies, and those in the world of finance must also leave behind the prevailing disregard for nature and invest instead in a thriving planet. A community of leaders, Champions for Nature, is working to halt nature loss this decade and highlight the vast business and economic opportunities of safeguarding our natural assets. Investing in a nature-positive economy in key sectors could create up to $10 trillion in additional annual business revenue and cost savings and 395 million jobs by 2030.

Members of Friends of Ocean Action, meanwhile, are fast-tracking solutions for a healthy and thriving ocean like piloting and scaling innovative new financial mechanisms to increase levels of finance flowing towards the ocean, to realize the true potential of a sustainable blue economy.

The Dasgupta Review clearly shows the choice humanity faces – we can either retreat into business as usual, with all the destruction that this will continue to entail. Or we can use this moment in time to leap forward and come together for a common purpose and seek a better world, where we regenerate nature to build resilience and health. I know which side of history I want to be on."

Danker, head of the country’s most powerful business lobby group, replaced Dame Carolyn Fairbairn in the role late last year.
Formerly he had been chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media, the publisher of the Guardian and Observer.
Saying the UK had failed to “build back better” from the 2008 banking crisis, Danker warned that productivity and economic growth had flatlined while the UK had become a more divided nation.
Urging the government to invest in a green economic recovery, he said a national economic vision for overcoming political cycles could be created.","war, work, economy, reboot, 1945, economic, respond, cbi, business, better, welfare, crisis, moment, uk, chief, postwar, 1945style",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"Britain needs an economic strategy for the next decade to match the ambition of the 1945 postwar recovery as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, the new head of the CBI said.

In his first keynote speech as director general of the business group, Tony Danker said the “triple shocks” of Brexit, coronavirus and climate change highlighted the need for business and government to work together on a long-term plan.

Invoking the work of the 1945 Labour government to reboot Britain’s economy from the devastation of the second world war, and contrasting it with the response to the 2008 financial crisis, he said the government, businesses and trade unions needed to work together on a fightback plan.

“I believe we must, and we will, come together to forge a better decade. More 1945 than 2008,” he said.

Danker, head of the country’s most powerful business lobby group, replaced Dame Carolyn Fairbairn in the role late last year. Previously he was chief executive of Be the Business, a government and industry-funded organisation launched by George Osborne with the aim of boosting British companies’ productivity. Formerly he had been chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media, the publisher of the Guardian and Observer.

Saying the UK had failed to “build back better” from the 2008 banking crisis, Danker warned that productivity and economic growth had flatlined while the UK had become a more divided nation. This time around he said “vision, a plan and a consensus as a nation to pursue it” was needed to rebuild a fairer, greener, economy for the 2020s.

Highlighting the creation of the welfare state and the birth of the NHS after the war as a moment when “real shifts for the better” had taken place, he added: “Let’s be clear. The scale of the shocks we’re facing today – Brexit, Covid, and the climate imperative – demand a similarly dramatic moment of unity and foresight. So, what will we take from this crisis? Where, in our darkest times, have we made real shifts for the better? Most notably, of course, in the aftermath of the second world war, when postwar reconstruction gave birth to the NHS and creation of the welfare state.”

Danker’s first speech in charge of the CBI came as Boris Johnson’s government drew up plans for easing coronavirus restrictions this spring and rebooting the economy from the deepest recession in more than 300 years.

Business leaders and unions have called for the furlough scheme to be extended until at least the summer in response to the damage inflicted by the Covid shock to build up sustainable recovery.

Warning against a full embrace of free-market ideology, he said a middle ground between big government and neoliberalism could be forged.

“For decades we’ve oscillated between the view that either government should run the economy, or that government should just stay out of it,” he said.

Urging the government to invest in a green economic recovery, he said a national economic vision for overcoming political cycles could be created. “We have been short term, both sides, and failed to unite around a shared plan to realise our potential. History will judge how we used this moment to map the path to get to 2030.”"

12:22 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you for your patience. We had a very good but long meeting with the chairpersons of the House of Representatives in the Oval, and it went a little longer, but it went very well. Thank you all for being here.

I’m accompanied by the Vice President and the Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, and I want to talk today about our plan.

And the January jobs numbers came out today. And while we are grateful for everyone who found work and is earning a paycheck, it is very clear our economy is still in trouble. We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the country last month. Overall, we added 49,000 jobs. And this at a time when we have more than 10 million people out of work, 4 million people have been out of work for six months or longer, and 2.5 million women have been driven from the workforce. Fifteen million Americans are behind in their rental payments. Twenty-four million adults and twelve million children literally don’t have enough food to eat.

These aren’t Democrats or Republicans — they’re Americans. And they’re suffering. And they’re suffering not because of anything they did. Through no fault of their own, they’re suffering. A once-in-a-century virus has decimated our economy, and it’s still wreaking havoc on our economy today. And so much of it is still about the virus. We’re still in the teeth of this pandemic. In fact, January was the single deadliest month of the whole pandemic. We lost nearly 100,000 lives.

I know some in Congress think we’ve already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country. Others think that things are getting better and we can afford to sit back and either do a little or do nothing at all. That’s not what I see. I see enormous pain this country. A lot of folks out of work. A lot of folks going hungry, staring at the ceiling at night wondering, “What am I going to do tomorrow?” A lot of folks trying to figure out how to keep their jobs and take care of their children. A lot of folks reaching the breaking point.

Suicides are up. Mental health needs are increasing. Violence against women and children is increasing. A lot of folks are losing hope. And I believe the American people are looking right now to their government for help, to do our job, to not to let them down. So I’m going to act, and I’m going to act fast.

I’d like to be — I’d like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I’ve met with Republicans. There’s some really fine people who want to get something done, but they’re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.

I’ve told both Republicans and Democrats that’s my preference: to work together. But if I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that’s — that’s up to the crisis, that’s an easy choice. I’m going to help the American people who are hurting now.

That’s why I’m so grateful to the House and Senate for moving so fast on the American Rescue Plan. Here’s what’s in that plan:

First, it puts $160 billion into our national COVID-19 strategy, which includes more money for manufacturing, distribution, and setting up of vaccination sites — everything that’s needed to get vaccines into people’s arms. There is simply nothing more important than us getting the resources we need to vaccinate the people in this country as soon, as quickly as possible. So, job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines. Vaccines.

The second, the American Rescue Plan is going to keep the commitment of $2,000: $600 has already gone out; $1,400 checks to people who need it. This is money directly in people’s pockets. They need it. We need to target that money. So, folks making $300,000 don’t get any windfall. But if you’re a two — if you’re a two — if you’re a family that’s a two-wage earner, each of the parents — one making 30 grand and one making 40 or 50 — maybe that’s a little more than — well, yeah, they need the money, and they’re going to get it.

And here’s what I won’t do: I’m not cutting the size of the checks. They’re going to be $1,400. Period. That’s what the American people were promised.

And very quickly, here’s the rest of my plan:

It has money for food and nutrition so that folks don’t go hungry. I think our Republican friends are going to support that. It extends unemployment insurance, which is going to run out on March 13th of this year, to the end of September of this year, because there is still going to be — we’re still going to have high unemployment.

It helps small businesses, thousands of whom have had to go out of business.

It has money to help folks pay their health insurance.

It has rental assistance to keep people in their homes, rather than being thrown out in the street.

It’s got money to help us open our schools safely.

It has money for childcare, for paid leave.

It gets needed resources to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of essential personnel — firefighters, nurses, folks that are schoolteachers, sanitation workers.

It raises the minimum wage.

It’s big, and it’s bold. And it’s a real answer to the crisis we’re in.

And it’s one more thing. And I want to say it very clearly on this — be very clear on this point: It’s better economics. It not only addresses the immediate crisis we’re in, it’s better for the long-term economic health of our nation and our competitiveness.

My plan creates more jobs, it creates more economic growth, and does more to make us competitive with the rest of the world than any other plan. Don’t take my word for it. Just look at what leading economists across the nation have said — and the world, and across the ocean have said.

Wall Street investment firm, Moody’s, says if we pass the American Rescue Plan, it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution has looked at the Rescue — American Rescue Plan and said the GDP of — will reach pre-pandemic projections by 2021, meaning we’ll have recovered by the end of 2021. And much sooner, by the way, than if we do nothing.

Look, just this week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that if we don’t take action, it would take until the year 2025 to return to full employment.

There’s also a growing chorus of top economists — right, center, and left — that say we should be less focused on the deficit and more focused on the investments we make, and can make now, in jobs, keeping families out of poverty, and preventing long-term economic damage to our nation.

The simple truth is, if we make these investments now, with interest rates at historic lows, we’ll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy, and our nation’s finances will be in a stronger position as well. And the payoff won’t just be in jobs but in our global competitiveness as well — because we’ll be regaining our economic strength faster.

So, the way I see it: The biggest risk is not going too big, if we go — it’s if we go too small. We’ve been here before. When this nation hit the Great Recession that Barack and I inherited in 2009, I was asked to lead the effort on the economic Recovery Act to get it passed. It was a big recovery package, roughly $800 billion. I did everything I could to get it passed, including getting three Republicans to change their votes and vote for it.

But it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t quite big enough. It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger. Today, we need an answer that meets the challenge of this crisis, not one that falls short. And that’s the issue facing the country right now.

What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough. All of a sudden, many of them have rediscovered fiscal restraint and the concern for the deficits. But don’t kid yourself — this approach will come with a cost: more pain for more people, for longer than it has to be.

Secretary Yellen talks about the scarring effect that comes with prolonged economic pain. We see that scarring effect in economic data. But more important, we can see it in the lives of people living with long-term unemployment, living in hunger, at wits’ end over how to keep their jobs and take care of their kids.

And then she talks about the need to alleviate long-term suffering in the economy. We can do that. We don’t have to wait until 2025 to get back to full employment, which will be the case if we don’t do this.

Again, independent analysis from places like

Moody’s, on Wall Street, the Brookings Institution — the American Rescue Plan could achieve that by the beginning — full employment by the beginning of next year.

So, to me, this is — this is what this moment comes down to. Are we going to pass a big enough package to vaccinate people, to get people back to work, to alleviate the suffering in this country this year? That’s what I want to do. Or are we going to say to millions of Americans who are out of work — many of whom have been out of work for six months or longer, who have been scarred by this economic and public health crisis — “Don’t worry, hang on. Things are going to get better. We’re going to go smaller, so it’s just going to take us a lot longer”? Like, until 2025. That’s the Republican answer right now.

I can’t in good conscience do that. Too many people in the nation have already suffered for too long through this pandemic and economic crisis. And telling them we don’t have the money to alleviate their suffering, to get to full employment sooner, to vaccinate America after $8 trillion in deficit spending over the past four years — much of it having gone to the wealthiest people in the country — is neither true nor necessary.

We do have the resources to get to full employment sooner. We do have the tools to reduce a lot of suffering in this country. We just have to choose to use them.

So it’s time to act. We can reduce suffering in this country. We can put people back to work. We can control — gain control of this virus. That’s what the American Rescue Plan does. And that’s what I’m determined to do, and that’s what I hope we’re going to be able to do in the near term.

So may God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And I truly believe real help is on the way. Thank you all so very much. Thank you.

BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's caretaker government raised the price of subsidized bread and flour on Monday for the fourth time in less than a year amid a crippling economic crisis.

Lebanon was grappling with the worst economic crisis in its history even before the public health crisis caused by the pandemic. The government defaulted on its foreign debt last year amid growing public debt, dwindling revenues and foreign currency.

Banks closed their doors for two weeks and restricted transfers and withdrawals as nationwide protests spread and the local currency tumbled. Pegged to the dollar for nearly 30 years, the Lebanese pound has now lost 80% of its value as a black market thrives.

Unemployment worsened, inflation soared and nearly half of the population is now living below the poverty line. Repeated lockdowns and restrictions because of surge in coronavirus cases has added to the hardship.

In a sign of the deepening crisis, the government in June raised the price of flatbread, a staple in Lebanon, for the first time in a decade by more than 30%. It has since raised the price twice before Monday.

Economy minister Raoul Nehme said Monday the price of a bag of flatbread would be revisited if the local currency gains strength in the face of the dollar or if the price of wheat worldwide decreases.

For now, Nehme said a small bag of flatbread will sell at 1,750 Lebanese pounds (20 cents at black market rate), up from 1,250 pounds (14 cents.) The weight of the bag would increase by 50 grams (1.7 ounces).

The owner of a well-known nationwide bakery, Assaad Bou Habib, said he expects yet another price hike soon as the government's foreign reserves dwindle. He said his business, Wooden Bakery, is surviving only because of franchises it has elsewhere in the region.

“If we didn't have branches abroad, our situation in Lebanon would have been catastrophic,” Bou Habib said.

Bou Habib's bakery, which also sells other baked goods, has mainly been selling basic bread as consumers struggle economically. He said he has already had to tap into his company's reserves and has stopped making a profit.

To make matters worse, ingredients essential for baking, such as sugar and yeast, are also in short supply, Bou Habib said.

“This is a danger for every bakery,” he said."

Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly more than expected in the fourth quarter, tipping Southeast Asia’s largest economy into its first full-year contraction in more than 20 years in 2020 as it grappled with the hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.

GDP shrank by 2.19 percent in October-December compared with the same period a year earlier, data released by the statistics bureau on Friday showed. That was worse than the 2 percent contraction expected in a poll of economists carried out by the Reuters news agency, but improving from the 3.49 percent slump in the previous quarter.

Indonesia’s main stock index erased its earlier gain after the data was released, having traded up as much as 0.7 percent before the announcement.

The Indonesian economy fell into recession last year as it struggled to get its COVID-19 outbreak under control. The country has the highest caseload and death toll from the respiratory disease in Southeast Asia.

For 2020 as a whole, GDP fell 2.07 percent from a year earlier, the first full-year contraction since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. That was slightly larger than the 2 percent contraction in the Reuters poll, and roughly in the middle of the government’s forecast range for a 1.7-2.2 percent fall. GDP grew by 5 percent in the full year of 2019.

Indonesia has struggled to find a clear path out of recession, as looser curbs on movement during much of the fourth quarter hastened the virus’s spread yet failed to spur private consumption. COVID-19 infections and deaths continued to rise by record numbers in January, prompting more stringent anti-virus measures and raising doubts about whether Indonesia could return to growth this quarter.

Household and government spending lag

Household consumption, which makes up more than half of Indonesia’s GDP, fell by 3.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 4.1 percent drop in the previous quarter, while investment remained sluggish with a 6.2 percent fall.

Government spending was up just 1.8 percent, considerably slower than the previous quarter’s 9.8 percent growth.

But some analysts say Indonesia’s vaccination programme should help it to start the recovery process.

“Unlike the rest of the world, the government is prioritising vaccinating the economically active population first. As fear of being infected falls, people’s behaviour is also likely to start to return to normal,” Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at research firm Capital Economics, said in a note sent to Al Jazeera.

Capital Economics is forecasting a 7.5 percent growth rate for 2021, leaving it about 4 percent below its pre-crisis trend, it said.

Both the central bank and the government have sought to soften the blow from the pandemic.

Bank Indonesia, which cut interest rates by 1.25 percentage points last year and pumped $50bn of liquidity into financial markets, has pledged to use all policy instruments to support the economic recovery in 2021.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said this week she would boost fiscal support for the economy in 2021 to nearly match the 692.5 trillion rupiah ($49.39bn) the government allocated for pandemic relief programmes last year."

India’s economy returned to growth in the three months to December and the recovery is expected to gather pace as consumers and investors shake off the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, economists said.

Fiscal and monetary policy could boost India’s recovery prospects, they said, amid signs of a pick-up in consumer demand and government spending.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched plans for a massive vaccination drive, while outlining a slew of tax incentives to boost the manufacturing sector.

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.4 percent in October-December compared with the same period a year earlier, data released by the National Statistics Office on Friday showed. That compared with revised contractions of 7.3 percent in July-September and 24.4 percent in April-June.

Investment recorded its first growth since December 2019, growing at 2.6 percent compared to a revised 6.8 percent fall in the previous quarter, while weakness in consumer demand eased.

Consumer spending – the main driver of the economy – dropped 2.4 percent year-on-year in October-December compared to an 11.3 percent fall in the previous quarter, data showed.

The economy has returned to the “pre-pandemic times of positive growth rates”, a finance ministry statement said after the release of the GDP data, which it said reflected a continued V-shaped recovery.

“Significant recovery in manufacturing and construction augurs well for the support these sectors are expected to provide to growth in 2021/22,” said the statement, which also cautioned that India is not yet beyond “the danger of the pandemic”.

Economists have raised their forecasts for the current fiscal year and 2021-22, expecting a pick-up in government spending, consumer demand and a resumption of most economic activities curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Annual growth of 3.9 percent in the farm sector and 1.6 percent in manufacturing during the three months to December raised hopes of an early recovery as the government rolls out plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to India’s 1.4 billion people.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has slashed its repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since March 2020 to cushion the economic shock of the pandemic, has projected growth of 10.5 percent in the fiscal year that starts in April.

Short-term risks

Some analysts warn, however, that a recent rise in crude oil prices and a surge of COVID-19 cases in parts of the country may pose risks to the nascent recovery.

“There are some risks that need to be watched, including rising commodity prices,” said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank, adding that the pace of recovery in the informal sector and contact-intensive services could be impacted by the resurgence of domestic virus cases.

India also revised annual GDP estimates for the fiscal year, predicting an 8.0 percent contraction, deeper than an earlier estimate of -7.7 percent.

Sectors such as retail, airlines, hotels and hospitality are still reeling from the impact of the pandemic.

The central bank left the repo rate unchanged at 4 percent earlier this month, saying the growth outlook had improved and inflation was expected to remain within the RBI’s targeted range over the next few quarters."

Although the revision meant that last year's overall drop in gross domestic product (GDP) was a touch less sharp than originally reported — 4.9% rather than 5%, the fall ended a decade of growth and was the biggest decline since the financial crisis in 2009.

Meanwhile, stricter lockdown measures at home and abroad continue to be clouding the outlook for Europe’s largest economy.

The data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Wednesday, marked an upward revision to its earlier estimate for a 0.1% expansion over the previous quarter.

The office also revised upward its 2020 full-year GDP figure to -4.9% from -5.0%.

Adjusted for calendar effects, the German economy shrank by 5.3% last year, a much smaller contraction than in many other European countries, helped by a strong fiscal response to the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

A debt-financed fiscal splurge created an overall state budget deficit of 139.6 billion euros or 4.2% of GDP in 2020, the office said. This was the first deficit since 2011 and the second-highest since German reunification.

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the growth data sent a positive signal, adding: “We will continue to do everything we can in the coming months to maintain the substance of our economy.”

Germany had registered a record growth of 8.5% in the third quarter and an unprecedented plunge of 9.7% in the second, due to the effects of its first coronavirus lockdown.

The second lockdown, imposed at the beginning of November in hospitality venues and expanded in mid-December to include most shops and services, caused a plunge in household spending in the fourth quarter, the office said.

Demand from China

Disposable income rose slightly, however, thanks to job protection schemes and state aid for parents. As the lockdown prevented many consumers from spending, the savings rate was an unusually high 15.7%.

Household spending fell 3.3% in the quarter and construction spending rose 1.8%. Exports grew 4.5%.

This meant net trade contributed 0.6 percentage points to the overall growth rate, whereas sluggish domestic activity subtracted 0.3 percentage points, the office said.

Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said export-oriented manufacturers benefited from growing orders from China while low-interest rates helped the construction industry.

But the outlook remains clouded as German authorities have extended the stricter lockdown until at least March 7, while restrictions in other countries are weakening demand from abroad.

“Going forward, we stick to our forecast of a 1.5% q/q decline in the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to the negative effects on overall economic activity from the extended and tightened lockdown,” UniCredit said in a research note.

Carsten Brzeski from ING said that stricter lockdown measures since mid-December, weaker demand from other eurozone countries, harsh winter weather in February and a reversal of pre-Brexit hoarding in the U.K. had increased the downside risk for the first quarter of 2021.

“The growth drivers of the fourth quarter could easily become drags in the first,” Brzeski cautioned."

Because the recession in 2020 was not as deep as expected, and thanks to the breakthroughs regarding vaccines, we now project the EU economy will return to its pre-crisis GDP level already in 2022 EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni

For 2022, the EU executive is forecasting GDP growth of 5.3%, up from the previous figure of 4.8%. These numbers put Spain in the lead for economic growth in Europe.

Even so, Brussels believes that by late 2022 Spain still won’t have recovered its pre-pandemic GDP levels. It also warned the country faces a surge in corporate insolvencies as government support measures are phased out.

The European Commission’s forecast falls below the Spanish government’s own estimate of 7.2% growth, although Brussels notes that it did not take into account the impact of the European recovery fund, which will offer Spain as much as €140 billion in grants and loans. Madrid estimates that this financial boost will add 2.1% to the growth rate.

Cautious optimism

Brussels’ report denotes a certain amount of optimism – with many caveats – after Germany and Spain ended 2020 in a better position than expected.

“While the outlook for the near term looks weaker than expected last autumn, growth in the European economy is set to resume this spring and gather momentum in the summer, as progress in vaccinations allows for a gradual unfreezing of economic activity,” reads the report, even as it warns about the possibility of a resurgence of infections that would delay recovery once more.

The Commission said that GDP growth in the EU will be 3.7% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022. For the euro zone, it is forecasting the same growth rate of 3.8% in both years.

“Because the recession in 2020 was not as deep as expected, and thanks to the breakthroughs regarding vaccines, we now project the EU economy will return to its pre-crisis GDP level already in 2022,” said Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni at the news conference to present the forecast.

Tourism: a slow recovery

The report notes, however, that recovery will not be the same across countries. “The recovery is set to be uneven across member states. This mainly reflects differences in the structure of each economy and the relative importance of tourism and leisure activities,” said Gentiloni. This is the case in Spain, where tourism is a main contributor to GDP. The sector has keenly felt the impact of the coronavirus crisis, which reduced visitor numbers to a trickle last year.

The report talks about a “soft recovery” of tourism in Spain this year, while “in 2022, the tourism recovery is expected to gain momentum, with most impediments to activity fully lifted.”

Exports, investment and domestic demand are also expected to pick up again as restrictions are progressively lifted. But the study warns about the risk of a surge in company insolvencies as policy support measures are also removed, “mainly concentrated in those sectors most affected by activity restrictions.”

By adapting to the crisis, Singapore averted a deeper economic recession, and prevented its unemployment rate from spiking by a further 1.7 percentage points.

In its interim assessment of the impact of key Covid-19 Budget measures released on Thursday (Feb 11), the ministry said the pandemic demanded a coordinated response across the public health, economic and social domains.

The Government in turn responded with a strategy to protect lives, livelihoods and provide social support, it said. ""The mix of measures was continually fine-tuned to help Singapore adapt to the rapidly changing situation.""

To protect lives, $13.8 billion was committed to public health measures such as expanding contact tracing and testing capacities, beefing up the number of intensive care unit beds and community care facilities, and signing advance purchase deals with vaccine manufacturers.

The $73.5 billion devoted to workers and businesses evolved from broad-based emergency relief in order to save jobs and preserve capabilities, to facilitating resource reallocation and business transformation.

At the height of the crisis, up to 75 per cent of the wages of all resident workers were subsidised through the $26.9 billion Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).

Tax and rental relief, as well as financing schemes such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme, threw a lifeline to struggling firms.

Because the circuit breaker and safe distancing measures limited people's opportunities to spend, government measures were more heavily weighted towards preserving capabilities, which in turn saved jobs and livelihoods, said the report.

""These measures were pivotal in preserving and creating good jobs as Singapore braved Covid-19. They also enable businesses to retain business know-how, connections and networks, allowing them to quickly bounce back as the economy recovers.""

The later Budgets focused on incentivising firms to adopt technology and increase hiring, and getting people into jobs through schemes such as the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.

As for the $10 billion set aside for social and household support, this included schemes such as the Temporary Relief Fund, Covid-19 Support Grant and Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme, which have together helped over 500,000 people.

The combined Budgets averted a deeper economic recession last year, said the MOF."

When President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law earlier this month, it was the sixth federal stimulus bill enacted since the coronavirus pandemic began to cripple the U.S. economy last year. With relief money flowing and vaccines rolling out—the U.S. administered its 100 millionth vaccine shot the same week Biden signed the stimulus bill—the economic outlook for the summer months and beyond is looking sunnier, though recovery still depends on defeating the virus.

Millions unemployed, interest rates at rock bottom, and trillions of dollars in stimulus spending.

Ahead of the one year anniversary of the signing of the historic $2.2 trillion CARES Act on March 27, here are ten numbers that sum up where we’ve been over the last year and where we might be headed next.

$5.4 trillion

How much the federal government has now authorized in stimulus spending

That money came over the course of six relief bills enacted by Congress over just one year. The first two bills signed in early March 2020 authorized federal funding for virus testing, small business loans, expanded unemployment and paid sick leave. President Trump signed the next bill and largest of the six, the CARES Act, into law on March 27—just 16 days after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. The CARES Act authorized the first round of $1,200 stimulus checks, set up enhanced federal unemployment insurance at $600 per week and jump-started a number of other major relief programs. The CARES Act was immediately followed by a $484 billion bill that replenished the Paycheck Protection Program after it ran out of funding in just two weeks. After a months-long impasse in Congress, President Trump signed a $900 billion stimulus bill into law just after Christmas. That was followed by President Biden’s flagship American Rescue Plan Act, which he signed into law on March 11, 2021.

Nearly zero

Current interest rates, after the Federal Reserve cut them to prevent a market catastrophe

On Sunday, March 15, 2020, after a week that saw stocks’ worst losses since 1987, the Federal Reserve announced it would slash interest rates to near-zero levels (a target between 0.0% and 0.25%, down from the previous target of between 1.00% and 1.25%). The sudden rate cut and accompanying announcement that the Fed would purchase $700 billion in government debt was an attempt to stabilize the careening market and reassure investors that the federal government would see the economy through the crisis. A year later, amid concerns that trillions of dollars in stimulus spending and a frothy stock market could trigger dangerous inflation, the Fed has signaled it won’t raise rates any time soon and will continue buying $120 billion in bonds per month despite some signs the economy is improving. “While we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said last week.

$3,200

That’s how much eligible Americans received over the course of three rounds of stimulus checks

Included in all those stimulus bills were provisions for three rounds of direct payments from the federal government in the amounts of $1,200, $600 and $1,400. Those relief payments were widely credited with boosting household spending, especially on rent, bills, and other essentials, though households with larger incomes tended to save rather than spend them. That’s led to criticism that the checks are an inefficient use of federal relief funds under their current eligibility criteria.

$1.6 trillion

Excess savings households accumulated last year

Thanks to business closures across the country, especially in the leisure and hospitality sectors, U.S. households accumulated some $1.6 trillion in “excess savings” in 2020. That’s $1.6 trillion that Americans were prepared to spend, sitting in bank accounts until businesses rebound. Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect that number to rise to $2.4 trillion by the middle of the year, when “normal economic life is restored.” Those excess savings are expected to fuel a surge in consumer spending later this year, though experts have said all that money won’t be spent at once and that high-income households are much less likely to spend it at all.

$835 billion

How much the government has authorized for struggling small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program

The wildly popular Paycheck Protection Program was set up by the CARES Act last March to extend forgivable loans to help small businesses cover payroll and overhead costs during the pandemic. Its first round of funding was depleted in just two weeks after a chaotic launch period and an overwhelming crush of applications. More than 1.3 million small businesses have received loans worth a cumulative $104 billion, the Small Business Administration said last month, but the program has been criticized for disproportionately favoring larger businesses—and sometimes public companies—over smaller mom and pop shops that lacked the strong banking relationships that were necessary to navigate the application process in the early days. The Biden administration tweaked the program last month to prevent large firms from crowding out small and minority applicants.

9.5 million

One year into the crisis, that’s how many jobs have not yet been recovered

According to data released by the Labor Department in February, the United States is still down 9.5 million jobs compared to February 2020, the month before the pandemic hit. That’s a huge improvement compared to the 22 million jobs that were lost by last April, but it’s also an indicator that the labor market has a long way to go before it recovers to pre-pandemic levels. The U.S. is regularly seeing upwards of 700,000 new unemployment claims per week, which is high by historical standards but significantly lower than the 6.9 million claims the U.S. clocked during a single week last March. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that it’s “not at all likely” that the U.S. will return to pre-pandemic employment levels any time this year, though Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that she believes the economy may return to full employment in 2022.

10%

That’s how much home prices soared between January 2020 and January 2021 while millions struggled with rent

As interest rates plummeted last year and remote workers sought larger spaces, home prices jumped by 10% on an annualized basis this January. That’s their highest annual gain since 2013, according to CoreLogic, and it’s likely prices will keep rising this year. But while the housing market sizzled, the pandemic also exacerbated housing insecurity for millions of Americans. Last August, the Aspen Institute think tank estimated that between 30 and 40 million Americans were at risk of eviction. And this February, some 13.5 million adults living in rental housing said their household was not caught up on rent, according to data from the Census Bureau.

3.5%

GDP losses in 2020, but major growth is on the horizon

After a 3.5% contraction in 2020, experts are expecting massive growth in the U.S. economy this year. The Federal Reserve is expecting 6.5% growth in 2021, as is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD’s most recent forecast is more than double its December estimate of 3.2% growth and is based on a faster-than-expected vaccine rollout and the federal government’s unprecedented stimulus spending.

$3.1 trillion

The U.S. budget deficit in the 2020 fiscal year

As tax revenue shrank and stimulus spending skyrocketed, the federal budget deficit—the difference between government spending and revenue—hit an all time high of $3.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, or nearly 15% of GDP. That’s its highest level since 1945 and more than triple the deficit in 2019. Data released by the Treasury Department earlier this month shows that the deficit rose to more than $1 trillion in the first five months of the 2021 fiscal year. That was before the passage of the American Rescue Plan in March, which is expected to add another $1.856 trillion to the deficit between this year and 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

1957

April’s inflation losses were the largest since data collection began in 1957, but levels are climbing back to normal—for now

In addition to pumping up the deficit, some economists are worried that unprecedented stimulus spending coupled with a surge in consumer spending when the economy reopens will send inflation soaring to unsustainable levels. The core consumer price index (one measure of inflation) dropped 0.4% from the previous month in April 2020, its largest decline since data collection began in 1957. The Federal Reserve expects core CPI to hit 2.2% in 2021—that’s above the central bank’s 2% target, but Fed chair Powell has repeatedly emphasized that he expects a short-term, manageable spike in prices this year as the economic recovery heats up. “At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support it needs for as long as it takes,” Powell said last week."

BEIRUT (AP) — Shops closing, companies going bankrupt and pharmacies with shelves emptying — in Lebanon these days, fistfights erupt in supermarkets as shoppers scramble to get to subsidized powdered milk, rice and cooking oil.

Like almost every other Lebanese, Nisrine Taha’s life has been turned upside down in the past year under the weight of the country’s crushing economic crisis. Anxiety for the future is eating at her.

Five months ago, she was laid off from her job at the real estate company where she had worked for years. Her daughter, who is 21, cannot find work, forcing the family to rely on her husband’s monthly salary which has lost 90% of its value because of the collapse of the national currency.

The family hasn’t been able to pay rent for seven months, and Taha worries their landlord’s patience won’t last forever. As the price of meat and chicken soared beyond their means, they changed their diet.

“Everything is very expensive,” she said.

Taha’s family is among hundreds of thousands of lower income and middle class Lebanese who have been plunged into sudden poverty by the crisis that started in late 2019 — a culmination of decades of corruption by a greedy political class that pillaged nearly every sector of the economy.

The Lebanese pound has lost more than 25% in value over the past weeks alone. Inflation and prices of basic goods have skyrocketed in a country that imports more than 80% of its basic goods. Purchasing power of salaries has dramatically declined and savings have evaporated — all on top of the coronavirus pandemic and a massive explosion last August at Beirut’s port that damaged parts of the capital.

More than half the population now lives in poverty, according to the World Bank, while an intractable political crisis heralds further collapse.

Alia Moubayed, managing director at Jefferies, a diversified financial services company, said the “sharp contraction in growth, coupled with hyperinflation and devaluation” has pushed more people into precarious employment, raised unemployment levels and brought more than 50% of the population below the poverty line, compared to an estimated third in 2018.

Lebanon has been without a government since the last one resigned in August, with top politicians unwilling to compromise over the formation of a new Cabinet that could forge a path toward reforms and recovery. Street violence and sectarian tensions are on the rise.

“People are dying, and no one cares!” said Taha as she visited a cousin who owns a perfume shop in Beirut’s commercial Hamra Street. Both wore masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Once a famous shopping district, known for its boutiques, bustling cafes and theaters, Hamra Street has changed amid the pandemic. On a recent day, many shops were closed, some because of lockdown measures, others permanently because of the economic crisis. Merchants in those still open complain they are selling almost nothing.

Beggars solicited passers-by for money. A woman and her child sat on the pavement next to a drawing on a wall with the words: ” We are all beggars.”

“It cannot get worse,” said Ibrahim Simmo, 59, who manages a clothes shop. Sales have dropped 90%, compared to previous years. He couldn’t sell his winter stock during the nearly two-month-long virus lockdown earlier their year, and now the currency crash is making things worse.

Ibrahim Farshoukh, 28, said he barely pays the rent for his shop where he sells hand-made leather bracelets and bags. Sometimes his wife stays behind while he takes to the streets, trying to sell bracelets to passers-by. “The situation is unbearable,” he added.

The vast majority of the population gets paid in Lebanese pounds, meaning their incomes decline further while prices shoot up and pensions evaporate. The crisis has also depleted foreign reserves, prompting stark warnings the Central Bank can no longer finance subsidies of some basic commodities, including fuel.

Videos on social media show fistfights in supermarkets as shoppers try to get to subsidized products such as cooking oil or powdered milk. In one video, armed members of one of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies check ID cards inside a supermarket before handing over a bag of subsidized rice.

People who once lived comfortably are now unable to pay school fees and insurance premiums, or even eat well.

“I don’t remember the last time we ate meat. I cannot afford it,” said Taha, whose husband is an airport maintenance employee. The family’s diet now mainly consists of lentils, rice, and bulgur, she said.

The currency collapse has forced some grocery shops, pharmacies and other businesses to temporarily shut down, as officials warn of growing food insecurity.

Nabil Fahd, head of the supermarket owners’ association, told the local MTV station that people are hoarding goods, which stores can no longer restock — once something is sold out, storeowners have to pay more in Lebanese pounds for new supplies. We are “in a very, very serious crisis,” he said.

The price of bread, the country’s main staple, was raised twice over the past year — and then, earlier this month, bakers reduced the weight of a pack of bread, without changing the price.

Taha blames Lebanon’s corrupt political class for bringing the small nation to near-bankruptcy.

Assem Shoueib quit his job at a leading newspaper in Beirut in 2000 and moved with his family to France, where he opened a Lebanese restaurant near Paris. Walking through Hamra Street on a recent visit back, the 59-year-old said he made the right decision.

“It was clear the country was heading toward collapse,” he said."

Updated at 10 a.m. ET

The economy is staging a strong but still incomplete recovery, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to tell Congress on Tuesday, exactly a year after stock markets hit their lowest level during the pandemic.

The economy is now ""much improved,"" Powell is set to say according to prepared remarks, thanks to ""swift and vigorous action"" by Congress and the central bank to avoid an even more crippling downturn.

But Powell is also set to say ""the recovery is far from complete.""

Powell is appearing before a House committee Tuesday, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. They will then appear before a Senate panel on Wednesday.

Yellen is set to add a similar note of cautious optimism in her prepared testimony.

""While we're seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we're digging out of,"" she's expected to say. ""The country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak.""

Yellen and Powell's appearances on Tuesday come a year after stock indexes hit their lowest point after weeks of turmoil over fears of a new virus that was then starting to spread around the world

Since then, the stock market has come roaring back. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index are up 80% from their lows last March. The Nasdaq composite index has more than doubled.

Congress and the Fed have pumped trillions of dollars into the economy over the past year, including the $1.9 trillion relief package this month, providing a lifeline to both families and businesses.

""With the passage of the Rescue Plan, I am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact,"" Yellen is expected to say. ""And I believe they will be met there by a growing economy. In fact, I think we may see a return to full employment next year.""

Powell added the central bank ""will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.""

After coming to a near standstill over the winter, hiring picked up last month. A new round of $1,400 relief payments should boost consumers' spending power, as an improving public health situation offers the promise of increased travel and entertainment options later this year.

""The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected and looks to be strengthening,"" Powell said in the prepared remarks.

Fed officials have raised their forecast for economic growth this year to 6.5%, which would be the fastest pace in nearly four decades."

The South American grains producer posted a 4.3% year-on-year contraction in the final quarter, the official INDEC statistics agency said on Tuesday, while the economy plunged 9.9% for the full-year, both in line with analyst forecasts.

Argentina’s economy has been in crisis since 2018 when it turned to the International Monetary Fund for a $57 billion loan. The country defaulted to private creditors last year.

With the economy further hammered by the pandemic and the outlook uncertain, the government is now in crunch talks with the IMF to negotiate a new deal after the country restructured its private foreign debt late last year.

As pandemic lockdowns eased, the quarterly decline was far milder than a revised 10.1% third-quarter collapse and a record 19% drop in the 2020 second quarter, Argentina’s toughest point of COVID-19 restrictions.

“The end of last year was encouraging in terms of activity,” said Matias Rajnerman, chief economist at consultancy Ecolatina. Seasonally adjusted growth had been consistent recently even with some pandemic restrictions still in place, Rajnerman added.

“The outlook for 2021 is encouraging. It will depend on the coronavirus cases and what lockdowns are needed whether that can be transformed into reality.”

Pablo Besme, economist at consultancy Invenómica, said the positive growth outlook was a bright spot amid tough currency controls, high inflation and low investment, though the longer term still looked uncertain.

Positive numbers “will be unsustainable beyond 2021,” he said, adding that Argentina’s economic and debt issues had led to a “decoupling” with the global economy.

A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast the economy would tumble 9.9% for the year and 4.4% in the final quarter, both almost exactly on the mark.

The analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a fourth-quarter contraction ranging from 4.1% to 4.6%. The government and economists forecast a 5% to 7% economic rebound this year, which should start to be seen from the second quarter."

The IMF said the prospects for ""scarring"" from the current crisis remained substantial, even if systemic financial stress and the associated long-lasting economic damage had been largely avoided due to the unprecedented policy actions taken.

""Unlike what happened during the global financial crisis, emerging market and developing economies are expected to have deeper scars than advanced economies, with losses expected to be the largest among low-income countries,"" it said.

Economies that are more reliant on tourism or have a larger share of high-contact sectors such as restaurants and retail trade, are projected to have more persistent losses, it said.

This was true for the Caribbean or the Pacific Islands, with gross domestic product in the latter estimated to be 10% lower in 2024 than pre-pandemic projections, the IMF said.

The COVID-19 shock could also have a bigger impact on the labor market over the medium- and longer term, since some of those high-contact sectors may shrink permanently, the IMF said.

It said productivity could also be negatively affected by a decline in competition if dominant firms became more entrenched and further increased their market power.

45,2021-03-31 00:00:00,RELEASE: New CAP Data Highlights the Economic Crisis Faced by Latinos Over the Past Year,https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release-new-cap-data-highlights-economic-crisis-faced-latinos-past-year/,"In “Latinos Face Disproportionate Health and Economic Impacts From COVID-19,” Ryan Zamarripa and Lorena Roque examine the economic situation of Latinos over the course of the pandemic.
The Latino unemployment rate increased by 14.2 percentage points between February 2020 and April 2020 compared with a 10.8 percentage-point increase for non-Hispanic white workers.
Between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, Latino workers saw their median weekly earnings increase at a rate of 2.9 percent, slower than that of workers overall.
Latinos have been disproportionately experiencing food and housing insecurity compared with their non-Hispanic white counterparts.
“Latinos have undoubtedly been disproportionately harmed by both the public health and economic crises of the past year,” said Ryan Zamarripa, associate director of Economic Policy at CAP.","highlights, latinos, pandemic, data, white, past, economic, 2020, rate, release, cap, latino, nonhispanic, crisis, workers, unemployment, faced",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"Washington, D.C. — A new analysis from the Center for American Progress examines the ways Latinos have been disproportionately harmed by the economic crisis of the past year. Latinos and Black Americans have long faced structural and institutional racism that has prevented them from the same economic opportunities as their white non-Hispanic counterparts, but the pandemic and subsequent recession have further exacerbated these disparities for Latino and Black Americans.

In “Latinos Face Disproportionate Health and Economic Impacts From COVID-19,” Ryan Zamarripa and Lorena Roque examine the economic situation of Latinos over the course of the pandemic. Key findings from the analysis include:

Latino workers not only disproportionately work in sectors where consumer spending has dropped the most—including restaurants and hotels and entertainment and recreation—but they are also less likely to hold managerial positions in these fields, which means that they often work for lower wages with less job stability and fewer benefits.

Latino workers suffered worse initial labor market losses at the start of the pandemic and were slower to recover than their white counterparts. The Latino unemployment rate increased by 14.2 percentage points between February 2020 and April 2020 compared with a 10.8 percentage-point increase for non-Hispanic white workers. As of January 2021 the Latino unemployment rate was still 4.2 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while that of non-Hispanic white workers was only 2.5 percentage points higher.

The pandemic is exacerbating the Latino-white wealth gap. Between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020, Latino workers saw their median weekly earnings increase at a rate of 2.9 percent, slower than that of workers overall.

Latinos have been disproportionately experiencing food and housing insecurity compared with their non-Hispanic white counterparts.

Latina women have faced the worst economic outcome of any racial/ethnic and gender group. Latina women have seen the highest unemployment rate of any group—20.1 percent in April 2020. As of January 2021, more than 1 million fewer Hispanic or Latina women were employed compared with pre-pandemic levels.

The brief also suggests ways that policymakers can support Latino Americans, including by prioritizing a more equitable vaccine rollout, providing support for struggling renters and homeowners, extending federal unemployment benefits, and providing support for undocumented immigrants and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients.

“Latinos have undoubtedly been disproportionately harmed by both the public health and economic crises of the past year,” said Ryan Zamarripa, associate director of Economic Policy at CAP. “As Congress negotiates the next economic rescue plan, they should ensure that Latinos are not left behind. Policies such as funding programs that ensure equitable vaccine distribution, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and ensuring that undocumented workers are included in the next and all relief packages would not only help the country as a whole, but also help the Latino community recover more quickly from the crisis.”

The real estate busts in many European countries around 2010 led to a sovereign debt crisis that engulfed the euro zone.
The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is at least as big as any of those listed above, will also have aftershocks affecting companies, workers and governments.
This was because their profitability declined steadily after the global financial crisis of 2008 and borrowing costs rose in the run-up to the pandemic.
A lot of government support - for example, the JSS - will be ending for most firms by the end of this month.","pandemic, companies, firms, bankruptcy, beware, economic, corporate, bankruptcies, recession, crisis, support, covid19, financial, aftershocks",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"Every economic crisis has its aftershocks. History has shown repeatedly that things never return to their pre-crisis state.

The bursting of the stock market and property bubbles in Japan in 1990 led to more than two decades of economic stagnation and the rise of loss-making ""zombie companies"" that continued to be funded by Japanese banks, which then ran into trouble themselves.

The real estate busts in many European countries around 2010 led to a sovereign debt crisis that engulfed the euro zone.

The Asian financial crisis of 1997 was followed by a long period of corporate restructuring in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia in which thousands of companies and millions of jobs disappeared.

The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is at least as big as any of those listed above, will also have aftershocks affecting companies, workers and governments.

Solvency problems

When it comes to companies, many studies show that as economies start to recover from crises, solvency problems often become more, not less, serious, and this is also likely during the post-Covid-19 recovery.

One recent study by International Monetary Fund (IMF) economists is based on an analysis of 2,600 non-financial firms from six major Asean economies: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

It finds that while the firms did not engage in excessive risk-taking prior to Covid-19, in contrast with the Asian financial crisis of 1997 when property bubbles appeared all over South-east Asia, many of the firms entered the pandemic with high debts. This was because their profitability declined steadily after the global financial crisis of 2008 and borrowing costs rose in the run-up to the pandemic.

Even before the pandemic, about one-third of the firms could not cover their interest payments and a quarter were already ""zombie"" firms that had debt service problems for at least five years. This was especially true for firms in energy (especially prominent in Singapore's case), materials and consumer discretionary industries such as white goods.

Then came the pandemic. The IMF study points out that had there been no government support, there would have been a wave of corporate bankruptcies: Almost half of the firms would have been unable to cover their interest payments last year and one-third would have run out of cash by the year end.

Masked bankruptcies

But in many countries, bankruptcies were unusually low last year. Despite the worst recession ever, bankruptcy applications in Singapore, which had been rising since 2014, fell more than 18 per cent compared with the pre-Covid year of 2019. This was because of government support in the form of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and other forms of assistance, as well as reliefs from contractual obligations and bank forbearance.

For instance, the minimum threshold for debtors to be exposed to the threat of bankruptcy was quadrupled from $15,000 to $60,000, and they were allowed six months to pay up rather than the 21 days pre-Covid-19. The circuit breaker from April to June might also have prevented bankruptcy proceedings from taking place.

In addition, banks extended repayment moratoriums, letting many companies and individuals off the hook on their dues during the pandemic. In other words, the decline in bankruptcies last year reflected a masking of reality rather than the true state of corporate health.

But this year, the mask will come off. A lot of government support - for example, the JSS - will be ending for most firms by the end of this month. With reliefs from contractual obligations expiring, more creditors will be able to file claims for default, and bank forbearance will also end."

Half a billion dollars flows every week from Africa to its lenders, money that is desperately needed by vulnerable children.

Cash transfers have proven time and again to be the best-in-class method to offer both quick relief and build up resilience of individuals.

It is unlikely that in any 12-month period, at any time in human history, the prospects of hundreds of millions of children have taken as dramatic a reversal as has just occurred for sub-Saharan Africa’s next generation.

The response to COVID-19, compounded by the ever-increasing impacts of climate change, renewed and expanded conflict, and the continent’s first simultaneous economic recession, have combined to hit children the hardest.

2020 began with the prospect of modest economic growth across Africa and quiet optimism, a combination of relative stability and a blossoming consensus on the actions needed to address the causes of climate change that are already impacting so much of the continent.

When the African Development Bank (AfDB) released their Economic Outlook for 2020, it predicted growth of more than 3%. What happened next is well known: economies were thrown into a sharp recession, jobs evaporated, climate action stalled, and schools and other social services came to a standstill.

The debate on the efficacy of the pandemic responses will continue for years. Growing children, however, don’t have that luxury: the biology of brain growth and the opportunities for education are all windows that close quickly unless the right support is provided at the right time.

Never has there been a stronger case for immediately easing the debt burden on African nations – a case made in the release of the African Development Bank’s Economic Outlook for 2021. The message was reinforced by Nobel Laureate Professor Joseph Stiglitz, whose authority on the subject begins with the fact that, with Hamid Rashid, he predicted the unsustainable debt levels across the Continent nearly a decade ago.

The fallout of the COVID-19 induced economic crisis is beyond what individual nations can sustain and requires the concerted action of the international community. Without rapid debt restructuring and relief, half a billion dollars flows every week from the continent to service lenders, money that is desperately needed by vulnerable households and children.

Through UNICEF’s work across sub-Saharan Africa, we are now getting a better pulse on just how bad the situation is.

An estimated 30 million Africans slipped into extreme poverty in 2020, with another 40 million at risk of the same in 2021 – the great majority of these being under 18 – while over 250 million students received essentially no schooling. Unlike most of their peers in other regions, remote learning tools remain largely inaccessible. Millions of students are unlikely to ever return to school, forced to become permanent fixtures of the informal labour market or victims of early marriage. Reports of spikes in teen pregnancies are deeply concerning.

Already entrenched climate emergencies, catalyzed by recurrent cycles of extreme weather, are generating new levels of displacement and food insecurity, while increasing stunting and the proliferation of diseases like cholera and malaria. Again, children bear the brunt: two-thirds of preventable illness and deaths from environmental hazards are experienced by them.

Most sub-Saharan African nations have only nascent social protection systems, small-scale versions of the safety nets that are taken for granted in wealthier countries. At a time when African families need these programmes to be expanded, shrinking revenues and rising debt repayments jeopardize government budgets to deliver basic social services.

The G20 leaders committed “to do whatever it takes” to minimize the economic and social damage from the pandemic. Stiglitz prodded further: “We have the tools to do it, we only need the political will.”

Rich nations were able to avail massive public investments to ease the impact on families. These assistance packages – a form of cash transfers – are referred to as “relief” and “stimulus”, in recognition that an additional benefit of helping families is that the funds go immediately into restarting the economy.

African families deserve the same, just as their economies need the stimulus. This will only be possible with additional financial support that begins with sensible debt restructuring of the type advocated by the African Development Bank and Professor Stiglitz.

Like anywhere in the world, families here need their children back in school, financial resources to help cover basic daily needs, and a fast and inclusive economic recovery.

Health, pandemics, epidemics What is the World Economic Forum doing about fighting pandemics? The first human trial of a COVID-19 vaccine was administered this week. CEPI, launched at the World Economic Forum, provided funding support for the Phase 1 study. The organization this week announced their seventh COVID-19 vaccine project in the fight against the pandemic. Davos 2019 - Press Conference: CEPI - Building a Global C... The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in 2017 at the Forum's Annual Meeting – bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and to enable access to these vaccines during outbreaks. Coalitions like CEPI are made possible through public-private partnerships. The World Economic Forum is the trusted global platform for stakeholder engagement, bringing together a range of multistakeholders from business, government and civil society to improve the state of the world.

Cash transfers have proven time and again to be the best-in-class method to offer both quick relief and build up resilience of individuals, households and national economies. One simple intervention yields diverse impacts: reducing the need for child labour, improving food security, increasing access to health and education services, building a family’s resilience to both weather the next shock and recover from the last one. Cash transfers are an investment in children, human capital and economic growth all at once."

The rebuilding of stockpiles accounted for about 75 per cent of the growth in the fourth quarter, and economists tend to distrust inventories as a predictor of underlying demand. Household spending dropped at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent, reflecting stricter pandemic controls and elevated unemployment levels.

Article content Weak employment swamps all other concerns in Ottawa right now. Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem last week reiterated that he intends to keep interest rates extremely low for at least a couple of years, telling the Calgary Herald’s Chris Varcoe that “we are losing productive workers, we are losing productive capacity in our economy.” Statistics Canada’s preliminary accounting of economic output in 2020 makes Macklem’s case. The hole left by the COVID-19 crisis is immense: GDP contracted by 5.4 per cent in 2020, the biggest collapse since 1961, when the agency began tallying quarterly economic output. By comparison, GDP dropped 2.9 per cent in 2009 in the wake of the Great Recession, and decreased 3.2 per cent in 1982, when many of the world’s richest countries were grappling with high interest, inflation and unemployment rates. The 2020 recession was unusual because service providers took the biggest hit. Many of those companies remain the most vulnerable to the virus and the approaches governments take to managing the pandemic. Output by the food, beverage and accommodation industry dropped 11 per cent in the four quarter from the third quarter, Statistics Canada said. “We have started laying off people now permanently,” Charles Khabouth, chief executive of Ink Entertainment, a Toronto-based owner of bars and restaurants, told the Financial Post’s Larysa Harapyn on Feb. 25. “We will probably be 25 (per cent) to a third less employees than before the pandemic.”

Financial markets have grown edgy about inflation, and evidence of faster-than-expected growth could exacerbate such worries. Statistics Canada in a separate report on March 2 said GDP likely increased 0.5 per cent in January from the previous month, suggesting the first-quarter contraction that the Bank of Canada and others anticipated will be avoided. Housing is the controversial star of the recovery story, albeit with substantial support from the federal government and central bank. Investment in real estate increased 3.9 per cent in 2020, defying early warnings from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) that the recession could crush our insatiable demand for houses. Instead, spending patterns shifted, as professionals bet on a future in which they would be working from home, rather than making daily commutes to the office.

Article content Buyers sought bigger properties in suburbs and smaller cities, spreading the mania that has long gripped Vancouver and Toronto to places such as Ottawa and Moncton, N.B. They were able to do so because they were either among the lucky ones who kept working, or because they benefited from generous emergency assistance. Disposable income increased 10 per cent from 2019 because the federal government opted for emergency benefits that erred on the side of too much, rather than too little. The savings rate surged to 15.1 per cent in 2020, as households hoarded salaries and benefit payments equivalent to the previous seven years combined, Statistics Canada said. The combination left many households primed to take advantage of near-zero interest rates, which the Bank of Canada would have anticipated, although perhaps not to the extent that ultimately transpired. Macklem last week said he was seeing early signs of “excess exuberance” in the housing market.

Article content An unambiguously positive surprise has been the rebound in exports. Canadian governments were unwilling to impose the same strict lockdown measures that allowed Asian economies to crush the virus, nor were they willing to tolerate the death toll that came with the laxer approach to social distancing in the United States. But exporters are benefiting from resurgent demand from both of those places, especially Asia, which is driving commodity prices higher. Cargo through the Port of Vancouver increased one per cent last year, despite an epic recession, led by record shipments of grain and potash. “We’ve been very fortunate,” Robin Silvester, chief executive of the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, said in an interview on March 1. “We’re seeing a really strong start to the year, continuing the trend that we saw toward the end of 2020.” That’s good, because Canada’s economy will need ballast for a while yet. “Nobody is going to book anything now until 2022,” Khabouth said. “In my opinion, 2021, on a large scale, is a writeoff for primarily all of Canada.” Financial Post • Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com | Twitter: CarmichaelKevin

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an economic crisis, shuttering businesses and cutting jobs around the world. This report looks at how the downturn has affected the standard of living globally and in seven major regions. The focus is on the distribution of people across five income tiers in 2020: poor, low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income. See the methodology and an earlier Pew Research Center report for more on the definition and meaning of these tiers in a global context. The key data source for the analysis is the World Bank’s PovcalNet database, which provides access to household survey data on either income or consumption for more than 160 countries. At the regional level, the latest year for which comprehensive data are available ranges from 2014 for South Asia to 2018 for East Asia and the Pacific and three other regions. The global regions are as defined by the World Bank. These benchmark estimates of income are extrapolated to 2020 using World Bank estimates of output growth through 2020. One projection is based on the World Bank’s January 2020 forecasts of economic growth in 2020, and the other is based on its January 2021 estimates of growth in 2020. The difference between these two measures is used to represent the effect of the pandemic on the income distribution in each region. Regional estimates are summed to yield estimates of the global distribution.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having a deep effect on the global economy. In January 2020, as reports of the novel coronavirus were emerging, the World Bank forecasted that the global economy would expand by 2.5% that year. In January 2021, with the pandemic still holding much of the world in its grip, the World Bank estimated that the global economy contracted by 4.3% in 2020, a turnabout of 6.8 percentage points.

The economic downturn is likely to have diminished living standards around the world, pushing millions out of the global middle class and swelling the ranks of the poor. At the same time, the path to a recovery is clouded with uncertainties.

A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that the global middle class encompassed 54 million fewer people in 2020 than the number projected prior to the onset of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the number of poor is estimated to have been 131 million higher because of the recession.

The drop-off in the global middle class was centered in South Asia and in East Asia and the Pacific, and it stalled the expansion seen in the years preceding the pandemic. South Asia, specifically India, along with Sub-Saharan Africa, accounted for most of the increase in poverty, reversing years of progress on this front.

As defined in this report (and in previous Pew Research Center analyses), people who are middle income live on $10.01-$20 a day, which translates to an annual income of about $14,600 to $29,200 for a family of four. This is modest by the standards of advanced economies. In fact, it straddles the official poverty line in the United States – about $23,000 for a family of four in 2020 (expressed in 2011 prices). By global standards, the poor live on $2 or less a day, or no more than $2,920 annually for a family of four.

The number of people in the global high-income tier (more than $50 daily) is estimated to have decreased by 62 million in 2020, erasing about half of the gain since 2011, with most of the change emanating from advanced economies. Meanwhile, the upper-middle income population ($20.01-$50 daily) fell by 36 million, while the low-income population ($2.01-$10 daily) is estimated to have increased by 21 million.

These estimates are based on the Center’s analysis of World Bank data on the distribution of people by either income or consumption levels in seven major global regions. The latest available estimates of income for each region, such as for 2018 for Europe and Central Asia and 2015 for the Middle East and North Africa, are extrapolated to 2020 using two sets of growth estimates: the forecasts issued by the World Bank in January 2020, prior to the pandemic, and the estimates issued in January 2021, with the pandemic’s economic impact in plainer sight. The difference between these two measures is taken to represent the impact of the COVID-19 downturn on the standard of living of people globally.

Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, some 1.38 billion people were expected to be counted in the global middle class in 2020. But the pandemic is estimated to have driven this number down to 1.32 billion. The share of people in the middle class globally is estimated to have been 17.1% in 2020, instead of potentially 17.8%. The erosion in the middle class might have been deeper if not for the fact that China – which is home to more than one-third of the global middle class – evaded an economic contraction, even though growth there was slower than anticipated.

The number of global poor is estimated to have risen to 803 million in 2020, much greater than the 672 million initially expected. The global poverty rate, which had been in steady decline this century, is likely to have increased to 10.4%, nearly reverting to the rate in 2017, instead of sinking to a new low of 8.7%, as previously expected.

The steep rise in global poverty is driven by the fact that many who were in the low-income tier prior to the pandemic lived on the margin of poverty. In 2017, 877 million people lived on $2 to $3 a day, according to World Bank estimates. Thus, large numbers were susceptible to falling back into poverty prior to the pandemic, especially in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

At the other end of the economic spectrum, the global high-income population likely fell to 531 million in 2020 from the 593 million originally expected. Consequently, the expected share in the high-income tier is 6.8%, not 7.6%. A vast majority of the global high-income population lives in advanced economies, and this group of countries also experienced a sharp downturn in 2020. Ironically, this bolstered the global middle-income population as people in advanced economies slipped down the ladder from higher income tiers.

The reversal in global living standards in 2020 comes on the heels of notable progress earlier in the decade. From 2011 to 2019, the global middle-class population increased from 899 million to 1.34 billion, or by 54 million people annually, on average. The pandemic is estimated to have erased a year of growth, leaving the global middle-class population nearly unchanged from 2019 to 2020.

Global poverty had abated at an average rate of 49 million annually from 2011 to 2019, with the number of global poor falling from 1.10 billion to 691 million during this period. The pandemic, by adding 131 million to the ranks of the poor, has set the progress on poverty back by several years, and the poverty rate is estimated to have increased from 9.0% in 2019 to 10.4% in 2020.

From 2011 to 2019, the global high-income population had increased from 459 million to 576 million, growing by an average of 15 million annually. Thus, the setback of 62 million due to the pandemic in 2020 also reverses several years of growth in the high-income population. The share of the global population in the high-income tier is expected to have decreased from 7.5% in 2019 to 6.8% in 2020.

The erosion of the middle class is centered in Asia, the rise in poverty in Asia and Africa

The effect of the COVID-19 downturn on the middle class and other income tiers shows distinct regional differences. Asia is expected to have accounted for most of the shrinking of the global middle class in 2020, with the middle-class population falling by 32 million in South Asia and by 19 million in East Asia and the Pacific. Meanwhile, the middle class in advanced economies is estimated to have increased by 16 million, in part due to the drop-off in the high-income tier in those countries.

The projected rise in global poverty in the pandemic is concentrated in South Asia (an increase of 78 million) and Sub-Saharan Africa (40 million), historically among the poorest regions in the world. The high-income population in advanced economies is estimated to have shrunk by 47 million in 2020, accounting for most of the falloff globally. It should be noted that the global cutoff for the high-income tier – more than $50 a day – is not much higher than the median income across advanced economies, as an estimated 40% of the population in these countries is in the global high-income tier. Thus, the contraction of the high-income tier in advanced economies is more a reflection of the reduction in the standard of living of the typical person in these countries than outcomes for the wealthy.

The contribution of a region to global changes overall and the shift in its own income distribution depends mostly on two factors: the sizes of income tiers in the region prior to the COVID-19 recession and the impact of the downturn on economic growth in the region.

Prior to the pandemic, nearly half of the global middle-class population – 672 million of 1.38 billion – was estimated to live in East Asia and the Pacific, a region that includes China. Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for 191 million, and Europe and Central Asia was home to 183 million. South Asia accounted for 123 million more.

In view of these magnitudes, the estimated loss (relative to pre-pandemic expectations) of 32 million people from the middle class in South Asia is notable for two reasons. First, the region contributed the most to the shrinking of the global middle class in 2020 despite having a middle-income population smaller than several other regions. Second, the percentage decrease in South Asia’s middle-income population from what was previously expected (26%) is much greater than in any other region. Although East Asia and the Pacific shed 19 million from the middle-income tier, that represented only 3% of its middle class.

Poverty is most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some 494 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, out of a total population of 1.14 billion, were expected to be living in poverty ahead of the pandemic in 2020. South Asia, with a total population of 1.86 billion, was expected to be home to 104 million poor. Nonetheless, South Asia is estimated to have added nearly double the amount of people to the ranks of the globally poor as Sub-Saharan Africa in the pandemic. The percentage increase in poverty in South Asia (75%) dwarfs the increase in Sub-Saharan Africa (8%).

The number of poor in other regions was smaller, estimated to range from 6 million in Europe and Central Asia to 27 million in Latin America and the Caribbean ahead of the pandemic in 2020. But, since that moment, the increase in poverty in these regions is notable. The Middle East and North Africa and East Asia and the Pacific are each estimated to have seen increases in poverty of more than 20% due to the recession. The rise in poverty in both Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean is not far behind, with each experiencing a 17% increase in poverty.

A large majority of the global high-income population – 489 million of 593 million – lived in advanced economies before the global recession took hold. The estimated decrease of 47 million, or 10%, in this population in advanced economies accounts for most of the shrinking of the global high-income tier.

In proportional terms, the drop off in the high-income tier is also notable in Latin America and the Caribbean (15%), Europe and Central Asia (12%) and East Asia and the Pacific (12%). The losses in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are relatively small in magnitude (each less than 1 million people) but also represent double-digit shares of the high-income populations in those regions.

The relatively outsized role of South Asia in the contraction of the global middle class and the expansion of poverty is the result of it seeing the sharpest reduction in economic growth in the pandemic. In January 2020, the World Bank forecasted that South Asia would experience a 4.3% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2020. But, in January 2021, output in South Asia was estimated to have decreased by 7.8% in 2020, a retreat of 12.1 percentage points from potential.

The setback to economic growth in other regions is smaller, ranging from 4.7 percentage points in East Asia and the Pacific to 8.6 points in Latin America and the Caribbean. East Asia and the Pacific is the only region in which growth is estimated to have stayed positive in 2020, with GDP per capita inching up by 0.4% even after the onset of the pandemic. Otherwise, the latest estimates of the change in output per capita in 2020 ranged from -3.2% in Europe and Central Asia to -7.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean."

“The brunt of the hit to the global economy is being felt in developing countries with limited fiscal space, tightening balance of payments constraints and inadequate international support, Unctad said.
Even so, Unctad said, international cooperation had fallen well short of what was needed given the scale of the economic and health crisis.","downturn, international, economy, end, unctad, suffer, global, countries, 2021, poorest, covid, trade, stimulus, development",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"The UN has said the poorest and most vulnerable countries will be the biggest losers from a pandemic downturn that will leave the global economy nursing $10tn (£7.2tn) of losses by the end of the year.

Despite becoming the latest international body to revise its growth forecast for 2021 upwards, the UN’s conference on trade and development (Unctad) said there were signs the pandemic would end with pre-crisis problems unresolved.

It said in its half-yearly update to its trade and development report that it expected the global economy to expand by 4.7% this year, up from the 4.3% it predicted six months ago.

It follows the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in upgrading its 2021 forecasts.

Unctad said recent developments in the US were one reason for the revision, citing progress in administering vaccines and the likely impact of Joe Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.4tn) stimulus programme.

It added, however, that the global economy would be more than $10tn smaller by the end of 2021 than it would have been had it continued on its pre-crisis trend. Underlying problems – inequality, indebtedness and a lack of investment – had been made worse by the crisis, it said.

“The brunt of the hit to the global economy is being felt in developing countries with limited fiscal space, tightening balance of payments constraints and inadequate international support, Unctad said.

The report from the Geneva-based body described 2020 as an “annus horribilis”, but acknowledged that the biggest annual fall in global output since the 1930s could have been even worse.

Early action by central banks to avoid a financial meltdown, stimulus packages from finance ministries, a recovery in capital flows and commodity prices and the “unprecedented” fast-tracking of vaccine development all helped to avoid an even more vicious deflationary spiral.

Even so, Unctad said, international cooperation had fallen well short of what was needed given the scale of the economic and health crisis. It compared the $12bn of suspended debt servicing payments for the 46 countries participating in the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative with the $80bn for the 73 countries eligible for the relief in 2019."

Laurent Berger, the leader of moderate labor union CFDT, also slammed the reform, even if he acknowledged some concessions the government made compared to the initial 2019 plans.

The overhaul, which the government initially designed to reduce instability and encourage people to take longer-term contracts, could cut benefits for some job seekers and ultimately hit some firms with higher contributions. After repeated delays during government lockdowns, the reform will now come into force July 1, albeit with an easing of some of the measures, officials at the labor ministry and Prime Minister’s office said Tuesday.

Macron’s decision to go ahead with the changes in a watered-down format aims to strike a balance between completing the agenda he pledged when elected four years ago, while not scuppering his chances of winning the presidency again in 2022.

The reform of welfare is the third plank in a trio that includes earlier changes to labor laws and training. The European Union is watching progress closely as it requests countries show evidence of such so-called structural reforms in order to get financing from the bloc’s Covid recovery fund.

“Unjust, Anachronistic""

But the changes to jobless benefits have met with fierce opposition from labor unions and risk hitting voters with only a few months to go to the presidential election in April 2022 and at a time when the economy will only just be turning the corner from the pandemic.

Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally party who is polling neck-and-neck with Macron, described the overhaul as a “political stupidity"" and an “infamy.""

Laurent Berger, the leader of moderate labor union CFDT, also slammed the reform, even if he acknowledged some concessions the government made compared to the initial 2019 plans. “Its philosophy and its impact are still there: it is unjust, anachronistic, incoherent and unbalanced,"" Berger said in a message posted on Twitter.

Softening the Impact

To soften the impact, the government has introduced a clause that means some measures will only kick in once the labor market improves in terms of new hiring and the number of unemployed. Those measures include tougher conditions to qualify for income support and the gradual reduction of benefits for those with the highest claims. The labor ministry also said it has introduced a floor that guarantees a higher minimum level of payments than in the initial pre-Covid plans.

For companies, the penalties, which will depend on the type of contract they offer new hires, will now only kick in from September next year, and the sectors worst hit by the crisis and government lockdowns will be temporarily exempted.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen attends an economic briefing with U.S. President Joe Biden in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 5, 2021.
The goal, she said, was to avoid the decade-long gap seen before the labor market recovered after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.
More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men.
“These are things that we are going to address over time,” she said, echoing remarks made at the White House by Julissa Reynoso, co-chair of the newly established White House Gender Policy Council and chief of staff to Jill Biden.","pandemic, house, covid19, yellen, labor, white, women, market, jobs, income, extremely, womens, force, million, crisis, unfair, having, impact",economic crisis,Economic Crisis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has had an “extremely unfair” impact on the income and economic opportunities of women, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday, calling for long-term steps to improve labor market conditions for women.

Yellen, in a dialogue with International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva, said it was critical to address the risk that the pandemic would leave permanent scars, reducing the prospects for women in the workplace and the economy.

She noted that women’s participation in the workforce was already lower in the United States before the pandemic than in Europe, another issue that needed to be addressed.

“I think it’s absolutely tragic, the impact that this crisis has had on women, especially low-skilled women and minorities,” Yellen said, noting that while people at the top of the economic scale had continued to do well, those nearer the bottom, who had already been struggling, had been hardest hit.

“It is an extremely unfair thing that’s happened,” Yellen said, noting that women as a group had experienced far greater job losses since they had been disproportionately represented in the service sector and many had dropped out of the labor force to care for children, who were out of school.

“We’re really concerned about scarring, permanent scarring, from this crisis,” she said, adding her hope that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief bill would help get the labor market back on track this year or next.

The goal, she said, was to avoid the decade-long gap seen before the labor market recovered after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.

As of January, women accounted for slightly more than half of the 10 million jobs lost during the coronavirus crisis, even though they typically make up a little less than half the U.S. work force.

More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men.

In the longer-term, Yellen said it was critical to improve the conditions facing women in the labor market, including lack of benefits, paid leave for family emergencies and child care.

“These are things that we are going to address over time,” she said, echoing remarks made at the White House by Julissa Reynoso, co-chair of the newly established White House Gender Policy Council and chief of staff to Jill Biden.

“Our goal is to really look at long-term structural changes that can advance the full integration of women, women of color ... so that issues of discrimination in equity and equality in the labor force and in pay can be addressed in a systemic manner long term,” Reynoso told reporters on Monday."

The support reached its height nine months later in October, with only 41% of the intensity seen following the financial crisis, Huang said, citing proprietary analysis.

Back then, massive Chinese stimulus helped boost growth worldwide. This time, China's focus on tackling problems at home will not provide the same kind of global support, senior economist Francoise Huang said in a note Monday.

BEIJING — China has recovered so rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic that authorities are pulling back support for the economy more quickly than they did following the 2008 financial crisis, according to Allianz.

China's economy grew 2.3% last year and was the only major country to expand amid a global recession.

Stringent lockdown policies and restrictions on international travel allowed China to return to growth by the second quarter of last year with only pockets of new virus outbreaks. In contrast, the U.S. is still reporting tens of thousands of new cases a day, while the European Union is bracing for a third wave of the coronavirus.

Stay-home measures and other restrictions on business activity have prompted governments in those regions to enact their own support measures. In particular, the U.S. under President Joe Biden launched a $1.9 trillion stimulus package this month.

That has global implications, including for China's policymakers.

U.S. ""super stimulus"" could increase China's exports to the U.S. this year and next by $60 billion, Huang said, citing estimates from Allianz's subsidiary Euler Hermes.

That sort of demand for Chinese goods adds to the already resilient domestic economy, giving authorities more leeway to address local problems without being too concerned about hurting growth.

""The aim of China's policy tightening is more about financial vulnerabilities and addressing the risk of overheating in the real estate and financial markets,"" Huang said.

However, Huang does not expect rate hikes or high-profile measures ""that could signal a policy cliff and jeopardize the economic recovery,"" but rather more subtle changes.

In a sign of how Beijing is taking a moderate approach, the People's Bank of China on Monday kept the loan prime rate — a benchmark for lending costs — at the same level in March for an 11th-straight month. The last time the central bank changed the rate was a cut in April 2020."

The world cannot walk head on, eyes wide open, into a debt crisis that is foreseeable & preventable.

According to the policy brief, 42 economies borrowing from capital markets have experienced sovereign downgrades since the start of the pandemic, including 6 developed countries, 27 emerging market economies, and 9 least developed countries.

Sovereign downgrades cause borrowing costs to rise, especially for developing countries, which can, in turn, increase the risk of more nations taking on unsustainable debt – especially if the COVID-19 pandemic is more protracted and deeper than expected.

“Unless we take decisive action on debt and liquidity challenges, we risk another ‘lost decade’ for many developing countries, putting the achievement of the SDGs by the 2030 deadline definitively out of reach”, Mr. Guterres urged.

The policy brief, entitled Liquidity and Debt Solutions to Invest in the SDGs, takes stock of the global policy response since April last year, assess remaining gaps and challenges for their implementation, as well as propose updates to the recommendations, presented last year, in light of developments over the past 12 months.

Need for debt relief

The brief highlights the need for debt relief to create space for investments in recovery and for achieving the SDGs.

Even in cases of elevated debt, new borrowing can lead to improved creditworthiness if it finances productive investments, it noted, adding that debt relief can also free up resources, create conditions under which countries can return to voluntary market access, and may lower a country’s overall borrowing costs, with positive impacts across the whole economy.

Assistance for small island States

The Secretary-General also urged governments to provide fresh concessional financing for developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States, recapitalize multilateral development banks and accelerate the timetable for replenishing the funds, meet official development assistance (ODA) commitments and provide long-term financing to developing countries for investment in long-term growth.

In support of recent endorsements from the G7, the document also called for a new general allocation of special drawing rights reiterating the need to combine a voluntary reallocation of the rights from developed to developing countries.

The brief also urged the G20 to extend the World Bank’s Debt Suspension Initiative (DSSI) until the end of June 2022 and include middle-income countries, notably small island developing States that have been gravely affected by the crisis.

It also urged the bloc to extend the eligibility for debt relief under its Common Framework for Debt Treatment Beyond the DSSI to other vulnerable countries on a case-by-case basis, as well as consider other mechanisms that would allow countries to access the framework, without compromising the credit rating.

Financing the 2030 Agenda

The policy brief was released to coincide with the high-level meeting of Heads of State and Government on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond.

The virtual meeting on Tuesday, followed up on a series of meetings and last year to mobilize action to assist the economic recovery from the pandemic.

The high-level meeting is convened jointly by the Secretary-General Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.

Liquidity is vital, urges Guterres

Addressing the high-level meeting, Mr. Guterres called for urgent assistance for developing countries so they have the financial liquidity they need to respond to the pandemic as well as invest in recovery, or risk a “lost decade” in development terms.

“I am encouraged to see that our insistence on the necessity for a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the reallocation of unused SDRs to support vulnerable countries, including middle income ones, is now winning widespread acceptance … let us make sure it happens – and is properly managed to the benefit of the developing world”, he said.

The Secretary-General urged a “three-phase” approach to debt, including a moratorium on debt payments, targeted debt relief, and reforms to the international debt architecture.

He also called for more responsible borrowing and lending, accepted by debtor and creditor countries, investors, market participants, credit rating agencies and international organizations, highlighting the need for a time-bound, open dialogue to build trust and transparency in a systematic, inclusive way.

“Together, with collective resolve, we can help all countries invest in response, recovery, and a more sustainable, resilient future.”"

Pharmacies went on strike and petrol stations rationed scarce fuel on Thursday across Lebanon as public anger over an accelerating economic collapse intensified with little sign of an end to a high-level political standoff.

Politicians have since late 2019 failed to agree on a rescue plan to unlock foreign cash that Lebanon desperately needs.

“We are really looking at the abyss, seeing it very clearly, and I think it’s either now or never,” Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said, alluding to the protracted failure to form a viable new government able to launch reforms.

He added main political parties, including President Michel Aoun’s ally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, were re-evaluating their positions as delays worsen the economy’s free fall and unrest grows.

Aoun told Saad al-Hariri, designated acting prime minister in October, on Wednesday to form a new government immediately or make way for someone else.

Al-Hariri hit back by telling Aoun if he could not approve his cabinet lineup, then the president should call early elections.

The two met again on Thursday, raising speculation about whether there would be a breakthrough after months of factional wrangling.

Following the meeting, Hariri said that forming a government that could re-engage with the IMF was the only way to halt the country’s financial collapse.

Hariri’s said a further meeting was scheduled for Monday and that he saw “an opportunity to be seized”, he told reporters in a more positive tone.

“The main priority of any government is to prevent the collapse that we are facing today… that we proceed to start halting the collapse with the IMF and regain the trust of the international community,” he added.

The Lebanese pound has sunk by 90 percent in the country’s worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. It has plunged many into poverty and endangered key imports as dollars grow scarce.

A French diplomat said on Wednesday that France, which has led aid efforts to its former colony, and its international partners will seek to ramp up pressure on Lebanese politicians in the coming months.





Strikes and closures

The currency has crashed so fast in recent weeks, losing one-third of its value, that grocery shops closed on Wednesday and bakeries cautioned they may have to follow suit.

Many pharmacies shut their doors on Thursday and flashed neon strike signs, the latest sector of the economy to voice frustration.

Ali Obaid, a Beirut pharmacist, said he could no longer keep up with expenses. “Pharmacies will close permanently if this continues,” he said.

Comments that subsidies – including on fuel, wheat and medicine – may soon end have also triggered panic buying.

Banks have imposed informal controls on people’s savings, and the central bank’s foreign reserves are dwindling in a country dependent on imports of more than 80 percent of its basic needs.

Cars lined up outside gas stations earlier this week, and scenes of brawls over subsidised goods at supermarkets have heightened fears among Lebanese over their most basic needs.

The sharp descent of the pound sent protesters into the streets, blocking roads in anger at an entrenched political elite that has dominated since the civil war.

But public anger has not spilled into nationwide protests similar to those in 2019 even as Lebanon is being gripped by multiple crises, including a surge in coronavirus infections and pressure on the health sector."

Brazil’s gross domestic product contracted 4.1% in 2020, the biggest annual recession since the series began in 1996, according to Brazil’s official statistics institute, known as IBGE. Still, the result is better the 5.3% plunge forecast by the International Monetary Fund in April last year.

Since the beginning of the health crisis, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has been adamant that the economy must keep running, arguing that lockdowns and restrictions would inflict greater hardship on the population than the disease. That position, which flew in the face of public health experts’ recommendations, helped stave off an even deeper recession, at least in the short term — as did a generous pandemic welfare program.

But the country is once again recording more than 1,000 daily deaths from COVID-19, which could cause further economic slowdown.

“The worsening COVID-19 outbreak is casting a dark cloud over the outlook for the next few months at least,” William Jackson, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a report published Wednesday. Jackson pointed to a plunge in retail sales and likelihood of tighter measures to limit the virus’ spread.

The number of new COVID-19 cases in Brazil is still surging, with a new record high 1,641 deaths reported on Tuesday. The state-run Fiocruz Institute said Tuesday that intensive-care unit occupation rates in 18 states and the Federal District had surpassed 80% – a level considered critical.

Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the GDP figures don’t yet capture the full impact of the disaster, including implications of lives lost, people going on disability from long-lasting side effects and lingering costs for the health system.

Now that the welfare program has ended, “lots of things are going on in the economy and none of them are good, and we’re going to have a very bad year in 2021. Had the government done things differently, it wouldn’t have been that way,” said de Bolle, who has done postgraduate studies in immunology and genetics. “If public health is in complete collapse, obviously the economy will be in complete collapse.”

Many state governors, scientists and health experts have begun pushing for tighter restrictions. The governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest state economy, announced Wednesday that stricter measures would take effect this weekend.

Bolsonaro has forcefully opposed measures by governors and mayors to limit activity, though the Supreme Court ruled last year that such decisions are local authorities’ prerogative.

Brazil saw a robust rebound in the back half of 2020, with 7.7% and 3.2% growth in the third and fourth quarters, IBGE data showed. Family consumption buoyed results in both quarters, helped by the government welfare program, but that was discontinued at the end of the year.

Brazil’s economy was expected to contract less in 2020 than any other major economy in the region, the IMF’s Western Hemisphere director, Alejandro Werner, wrote in a report last month.

Nearly 14 million people were unemployed in Brazil at the end of 2020, a slight improvement from the third quarter, according to IBGE data. Even more were underemployed.

Under increasing pressure to restore at least some emergency funding to poor Brazilians, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes warned this week that Brazil’s economy could resemble that of Argentina within six months and Venezuela within a year and a half if it doesn’t limit spending.

As mass vaccination progresses, Goldman Sachs’ chief Latin America economist Alberto Ramos said in a note Wednesday he expects Brazil’s services industry, which has been particularly badly hit, to recover by the second half of next year.

“In the very near term, the recent pick-up in new viral cases, the acceleration of inflation and the phasing-out of some of the generous fiscal transfers programs may soften the momentum behind the recovery of the services sectors,” he said.

BEIRUT -- Outraged protesters returned to the streets of Lebanon's capital Tuesday, blocking roads with burning tires and garbage containers as the currency continued to plummet to all-time lows and the country’s financial crisis intensified.

The protests resumed — although in smaller numbers — following several days of relative calm as the Lebanese pound continued its slide, plunging to a new low of 15,000 to the U.S. dollar on the black market.

“Where are the people? Come down, we are hungry, we are fed up!” yelled Ahmad Shuman, a protester frustrated at the small number of people taking part in demonstrations.

In another Beirut neighborhood, small groups of young men, some driving scooters, pelted shop windows with stones and asked them to close in an apparent attempt to broaden public outrage and force shutdowns.

In a panic, motorists queued outside gas stations fearing rising prices. Police went around to some gas stations in the south of Lebanon to ensure no one was hoarding fuel in anticipation of price hikes.

The currency has lost 90% of its value since October 2019, when anti-government protests erupted, including more than 25% in the past few weeks alone. Inflation and prices of basic goods have skyrocketed in the country, which imports more than 80% of its basic goods.

Senior politicians, meanwhile, have refused to work together to form a new government that would implement the reforms needed to extract the nation from the crisis.

The currency crash has pushed more than half the population into poverty. It has also depleted foreign reserves, raising concerns that Lebanon's central bank will not be able to finance subsidies of some basic commodities, including fuel in coming weeks.

Meanwhile, lawmakers approved $200 million in assistance from the central bank's shrinking foreign reserves to go to Lebanon's electricity company. The transfer is to cover fuel purchases for the next few weeks to prevent the country from plunging into darkness.

The crisis is posing the gravest threat to Lebanon’s stability since the 1975-90 civil war. France’s foreign minister warned last week that Lebanon is running out of time before total collapse, putting the blame squarely on the country’s leaders whose refusal to come together to form a government has exacerbated the crisis.

U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter, speaking to reporters in Washington on Monday, said the U.S. is concerned about developments in Lebanon and the apparent inaction of the country’s leadership in the face of multiple ongoing crises.

“Lebanon’s political leaders need to put aside their partisan brinkmanship and form a government that will quickly implement critical and long-needed reforms, restore investor confidence, and rescue the country’s economy,” she said.

Lebanon’s government resigned in August following a massive explosion at Beirut’s port that killed 211 people, wounded more than 6,000 and damaged entire neighborhoods in the capital.

Disagreements between President Michel Aoun, who is an ally of the militant group Hezbollah, and Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri, who is opposed to the group, have so far delayed the formation of a Cabinet. Hariri was chosen for the post in October."
