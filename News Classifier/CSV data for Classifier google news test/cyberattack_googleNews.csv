The breach was first announced on Sunday and later in the week the RBNZ said a file sharing service provided by California-based Accellion was illegally accessed.

The breach comes just months after New Zealand’s stock exchange operator was targeted in a series of distributed denial of service attacks that overwhelmed its website, preventing trading for several days.

“I own this issue and I am disappointed and sorry,” said Governor Adrian Orr, adding that the ongoing investigation showed the breach is “serious and has significant data implication.”

“While a malicious third party has committed the crime, and we believe service provisions have fallen short of our agreement, the Bank has also fallen short of the standards expected by our stakeholders.”

Accellion said in response to a media query this week that it was made aware of the vulnerability of its legacy File Transfer Appliance (FTA), a 20-year old product that specializes in large file transfers, in mid-December.

“Accellion resolved the vulnerability and released a patch within 72 hours to the less than 50 customers affected,” it said in a statement sent to Reuters on Tuesday.

RBNZ has said the system that was breached has been secured and closed, and New Zealand’s financial system remains sound and open for business.

Dave Parry, Professor of Computer Science at Auckland University of Technology, said the time difference between identifying the issue, making a patch and communicating it allowed the hackers to act.

“The hackers were simply faster,” he said.

Parry said RBNZ was aware of risks to its IT infrastructure and could have upgraded the 20-year old FTA software, but that it was not a terrible error as the systems were still working.

Apart from the forensic cyber investigation underway, the bank also appointed an independent third party to undertake a review of the incident.

Orr said he could not provide any further details as it could adversely affect the investigation and the steps being taken to mitigate the breach."

The hackers used multiple servers based in the United States to mimic legitimate network traffic and avoid detection from SolarWinds, companies, and the government.SolarWinds new CEO, Sudhakar Ramakrishna also became the company's leader this month.
He said his goal is to work with the SolarWinds team to immediately improve critical business and product development systems and make Solarwinds a leader in security for the enterprise software industry.

SolarWinds also said the attack might have contained an additional layer of malware layer that breached the system in 2019.SolarWinds has been working to investigate the source of a cyberattack. Reuters broke news of the breach Dec. 13, a day after the company said it first learned of the situation. SolarWinds has since released a number of software updates to address the problem and has said it's working with outside cybersecurity experts and federal law enforcement to investigate the breach.The investigation has shown the breach likely has affected nearly every level of government, as well as potentially hundreds of private companies. Reports of high-profile targets include the Justice Department, the Department of Treasury, Homeland Security and the Department of Energy, along with private companies including Microsoft.""We believe we have found a highly sophisticated and novel malicious code injection source the perpetrators used to insert the Sunburst malicious code into builds of our Orion Platform software,"" SolarWinds said in a securities filing.Federal officials have said the attack was likely Russian in origin. SolarWinds said Tuesday it could not independently confirm that Russia was behind the breach., citing unnamed sources, reported that the attack was carried out by Russian government hackers who go by the nicknames APT29 or Cozy Bear and are part of that nation’s foreign intelligence service.SolarWinds' Orion software, which was breached in the attack, is used by a range of companies and government agencies. As many as 18,000 of the company's 300,000 customers might have been running software, which contained a vulnerability that let hackers penetrate multiple networks.In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said a ""highly sophisticated and novel code"" was designed to inject malicious code into the system without arousing the suspicion of the software development and build teams. The hackers used multiple servers based in the United States to mimic legitimate network traffic and avoid detection from SolarWinds, companies, and the government.SolarWinds new CEO, Sudhakar Ramakrishna also became the company's leader this month. The company had announced former president and CEO Kevin Thompson would step down at the end of 2020 after more than a decade in the position, just days before the cyberattack discovery.""Although I accepted the position to become CEO before the company was notified of the cyberattack, I feel an even greater commitment now to taking action, ensuring we learn from this experience, and continuing to deliver for our customers,"" Ramakrishna said in an online post last week.Ramakrishna said SolarWinds will be reflecting on and enhancing its own security policies and practices. He said his goal is to work with the SolarWinds team to immediately improve critical business and product development systems and make Solarwinds a leader in security for the enterprise software industry.""Over 20-plus years, SolarWinds has earned the trust of our customers by delivering powerful and affordable solutions,"" Ramakrishna said. ""My mission is to continue to build on that relationship by delivering powerful, affordable, and secure solutions. I am confident in this future.""The company said it has so far traced suspicious activity related to the breach in its internal systems back to September 2019, a month earlier than previously thought. A subsequent October 2019 version of the Orion Platform first contained modifications, which Solarwinds said were designed by the hackers to test the ability to insert a code. The first malicious code, dubbed SUNBURST, was inserted into a February 2020 update to the Orion Platform, and customers had access to the software by March 26. Hackers later removed the code in June 2020. The company is still trying to understand how exactly the code entered its software.""We recognize the software development and build process used by SolarWinds is common throughout the software industry, so we believe that sharing this information openly will help the industry guard against similar attacks in the future and create safer environments for customers,"" the company said.On Tuesday, CrowdStrike, one of the companies working with SolarWinds to investigate the breach, said it has also identified a third malware strain, called Sunspot, tied to the attack. The companies have previously identified two other malware strains, the backdoor, dubbed Sunburst, and Teardrop, a tool that the hackers used to go deeper once in the system.As the company continues to investigate, cybersecurity experts have said the full scale of the attack could take years to understand. They also predicted the breach could lead to long-term changes in cybersecurity policies and practices for both the government and private companies.The company is also already facing at least one lawsuit following the attack, which accuses SolarWinds of violating federal securities law and alleges it made “materially false and misleading statements” related to security measures."

The most recent victim? Leading crane and lifting manufacturer Palfinger. The company has been targeted in an ongoing global cyberattack, disrupting IT systems and business operations. As a manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions, the Austrian manufacturer has a true global footprint with at least 35 locations. Its products have become a mainstay within construction industry as well as land and sea lifting, loading and handling.

In the manufacturing business, time is money, so the disruption of Palfinger’s IT services as well as order processing and shipment delays, translates to lost revenue, explains Andrea Carcano, co-founder of Nozomi Networks in email correspondence.

“The single biggest threat to enterprises today is underestimating and failing to address cybersecurity across all of a company’s cyber and physical systems. Attackers are going after higher value targets and that includes operational networks. The remediation costs and efforts to repair the operational, financial and reputational damage caused by these attacks put a significant strain on leadership teams,” he says. “IT and OT systems are converging and security teams need to take a new, holistic approach to cybersecurity. Businesses should deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning tools across their IT/OT networks to gain real-time visibility and identify cyber threats and resolve issues before harm is done,” says Carcano. “We know from working with thousands of industrial installations, that with the right technology and a focus on best practices, it’s possible to monitor and mitigate these risks and achieve operational resiliency. A robust cyber defense strategy is the best line of defense against sophisticated attacks.”

2020 was a year like no other. The global pandemic has changed how people live and interact with one another. For businesses, supporting social distancing has meant a significant shift to a remote workforce, and many businesses were not prepared for cyberattacks. In a recent study, Malwarebytes found that 20% of companies surveyed said they had faced a security breach as a result of a remote worker.

But what businesses are the most vulnerable? What types of cyberattacks have been prevalent during 2020? What about cybersecurity in a post-pandemic world?

Cyberattacks In 2020: The Biggest News And Statistics

It seems that cyberattacks are becoming more commonplace, especially during a global pandemic. News headlines break almost weekly about the latest victim of a massive data breach or cyberattack. Cybercriminals are doing their best to take advantage of the very unusual events that have transpired worldwide over the course of 2020. Several massive cyberattacks unfolded last year, and these are among the most notable:

Marriott hotels: On March 31, 2020, Marriott released news that an ""unexpected amount of guest information may have been accessed using the login credentials of two employees at a franchise property."" The data breach resulted in the compromise of 5.2 million guest accounts.

World Health Organization: Between March and April, hackers targeted the World Health Organization (WHO) and leaked staff credentials. The WHO hack was part of a large target of various organizations who were busy combatting the coronavirus pandemic.

Magellan Health: In April 2020, attackers carried out a sophisticated social engineering attack on Magellan Health, a Fortune 500 insurance company. Months after the attack, the number of affected victims is estimated to be around 1.7 million. The data that attackers exfiltrated contains information of both internal and external customers.

Blackbaud: Around May 2020, hackers compromised Blackbaud, a global technology company specializing in providing software for organizations involved in charity work and education, with a ransomware attack. Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack that accessed a subset of their internal systems. The fallout and exact scope of the attack are still evolving. At first, Blackbaud said hackers did not compromise financial data. However, the company later admitted that bank account information and users' passwords were among the details stolen during the attack. Blackbaud paid a ransom to stop data from being disclosed.

Garmin: On July 23, Garmin, a company known for fitness tracking devices and GPS technology, was compromised with a massive ransomware attack at the hands of hacking group Evil Corp. The attackers used the WastedLocker ransomware to hold Garmin's technology infrastructure hostage. Garmin may have paid upwards of $10 million ransom to Evil Corp to regain access to systems.

What Businesses Are The Most Vulnerable?

No one is immune to the attention of cybercriminals who may target any size, type or business location. However, we can observe specific trends with cyberattacks in 2020. For one, cyberattacks such as those using ransomware are growing in sophistication and scale. With ransomware attacks in 2020 during the pandemic, mature hacking groups like Evil Corp are going after large businesses, including Fortune 500 companies.

Cybercriminals have their sights set on ""big fish"" in various industries, as seen with attacks on Garmin, Blackbaud, Magellan Health and others. However, SMBs and ""mom and pop shops"" should not let their guard down because smaller and less mature hacking groups also target these organizations. No one is excluded from the risk of a cyberattack.

Ransomware attacks in 2020, tallied by BlackFog, have heavily targeted the following industries (ordered by most targets):

• Government.

• Manufacturing.

• Services.

• Education.

• Healthcare.

And what about ransomware targets by country? BlackFog has tracked reported ransomware attacks since January 2020. Here are their findings by target country:

• United States: 57%.

• Australia: 7%.

• Canada: 6%.

• United Kingdom: 5%.

• Germany: 4%.

• France, Japan and Italy: 2%.

• The rest of the world combined: 14%.

What Types Of Cyberattacks Were Prevalent In 2020?

• Phishing emails and malicious Covid-19-themed sites.

• Cloud-based attacks on SaaS offerings (Microsoft Teams, etc.).

• Ransomware.

• Direct attacks on remote workers.

Cybercriminals used the desire to keep up with the latest Covid-19 information to lure individuals into visiting malicious websites and falling victim to phishing campaigns. Cybersecurity experts found that some 4,000 coronavirus domains were registered after January 2020 alone. Covid-19-themed phishing scams are rampant as well.

By September 2020, note the following statistics:

• Companies have seen an 80% increase in cyberattacks.

• Attacks on cloud-based environments rose 630% between January and April.

• Phishing attacks rose 600% since the end of February.

• Cyberattacks on remote workers were up to five times what they were prior to the pandemic.

Specific to ransomware, note the following:

• Ransomware attacks have increased by 40% to 199.7 million cases globally in the third quarter.

• The US observed 145.2 million ransomware hits in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 139%.

Cybersecurity In A Post-Pandemic World: What You Need To Know

As we begin 2021 with the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines looming on the horizon, organizations will again face necessary adjustments. Businesses will need to continue to evaluate their cybersecurity stance during any transition or changes made in the post-pandemic world.

One thing is for sure: Cybercrime is a booming business and has accelerated with the pandemic. Cybersecurity experts predict that in 2021, there will be a cyberattack every 11 seconds, costing the global economy $6.1 trillion annually. Even if the world emerges from the pandemic in 2021, cyberattacks will continue and increase.

We can safely make the following predictions in regards to cybersecurity in 2021:

• Cybersecurity will be increasingly important.

• Organizations must bolster cloud software as a service (SaaS) security.

• Risks to data from ransomware and other threats will increase.

• Organizations will need to continue to bolster remote work security.

• As shown by the pandemic, there is no longer a network perimeter (a zero-trust environment is essential).

It's never been more important than now to protect yourself, your business and your customers from cybercrime."

If you are unsure about your cyber-safety structure, then it’s time to upgrade it. Otherwise, you could be at risk of lengthy legal battles that result in hefty fines. Beyond that, the cost in terms of reputational loss could be catastrophic if not handled meticulously by professionals within a reasonable time. Despite the best cybersecurity practices, cyber-attacks and data breaches are on the rise. Be it personal, financial, health, intellectual property or IT security information, data theft is a constant threat for everyone.

Compared to 2018, reported data breaches in 2019 jumped by 33.3%, and record breaches jumped by 112%, according to a Risk Based Security research report. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a commensurate rise in organizational preparedness to lower the risk of cyber-attacks. A Kaspersky study showed that over 57% of respondents don’t have a cyber-security policy in place, and in cases of medium-size businesses, the number jumps to 71%. This means smaller and medium-sized enterprises are at greater risk of legal consequences if they fail to follow relevant laws of the land.

In the modern digital space, data is more valuable than oil or gold. If you’re in possession of customer data, you are legally bound to protect it from cyber-attacks. Since cyberspace is highly dynamic, cyber law is evolving accordingly to ensure optimum protection. A failure to ensure the safety of your company’s customer data against sophisticated cyberattacks could lead to hefty fines. All businesses, but especially small and medium businesses, must know about the legal consequences of a data breach and the available solutions that can protect themselves from cyber-attacks and their consequences.

Cyber Attack: Legal Implications of Data Breach

If you’re running an enterprise that collects and stores consumer data in a digital format, then you have to implement “reasonable” measures to ensure data safety. Despite the universality of cyber threats, the laws requiring data protection and data privacy vary from country to country. If your business is U.S.-based, you have to comply with state-specific laws, as no federal privacy law is in place. And if you’re operating from the EU, you must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The state of Nevada enacted the Consumer Protection Law on October 1, 2019, whereas the Privacy Act in New York and the CCPA in California came into force on January 1, 2020. Under these laws, you are expected to be honest and transparent regarding disclosures of cyber-attacks and show that you are prepared to mitigate risks and resolve data breaches lawfully. If you are new in digital space and want to make your system cyber-threat-proof, then you must be aware of the legal implications enshrined in data protection law across all major jurisdictions.

Scope of Penalties

The likelihood and severity of fines can vary depending on the level of breach, number of individuals affected and regional jurisdiction. Country- and state-specific laws vary, so your legal team will be of great help in defining your firm’s liability in case of a data or privacy breach. The regulator will judge your case based on the level of threat, the nature of the compromised data and above all your pre-emptive and response measures. Another important factor, as mentioned, is your promptness in informing any affected individuals and authorities.

If you demonstrate the highest level of compliance and have an effective response plan in place, you can reduce the number of fines and other costs. All big companies have a legal team to handle all the necessary legal formalities, but if you run a small or medium-sized enterprise, you have to be very attentive. It’s not just about fines but about the theft of precious intellectual property—the core of your business.

Litigation

You may be aware of the risks involved in cyber-attacks, but legal action may be still brought if you fail to first notify the concerned individuals and authorities about the data breach. Your lack of a quick response to mitigate damage and lax data security measures could be other reasons for litigation. Under some regional jurisdictions, customers and shareholders could initiate legal action.

Anticipating Legal Issues

You know the nature of your business and the requirements of data capture and possession. You should discuss all the possible aspects of data security from both the technological and legal points of view at the board level. You should refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cybersecurity disclosure guidance document to discuss the nature and effectiveness of your firm’s cybersecurity system, policies and procedures. You should have a concrete data storage plan and cybersecurity insurance coverage.

Cybersecurity is a specialized area, so you should have a well-trained data safety professional in place to ensure all possible safety. It’s all about being ready to face the most advanced cyberattacks and having a robust reporting process in place to fight the menace.

What to do after a cyber attack

Timely Notification

If your organization or system experiences a cyber-attack that leads to a data breach, you are legally bounded to notify the affected individuals as soon as possible. If you are EU-based, under the GDPR, you have to inform the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) within 72 hours of the data breach.

In the United States, you must notify the attorney general of the concerned state within the prescribed time. Since it’s all about consumer data protection and privacy, you’re supposed to notify regulators like the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure timely disclosure of the cyber-attack.

The ICO imposed a hefty $124 million fine on a hotel chain for reporting a data breach of 30 million residents in 31 countries across the European Economic Area (EEA) two months after the incident. The data breach occurred in September 2018 but was reported in November 2018. Data breaches affect the reputation of the company, but no or late reporting could make things worse in the form of additional fines.

Effective Response

Cyber-criminals are well-equipped to break through even the best cybersecurity layers. It doesn’t mean you should trust in luck to protect your system. In the eyes of the regulator, your preparedness and response to cyber-threats and data breaches will define your credibility. You should have an effective response plan in place, as this could help you cut the chance of hefty fines. Any sign of negligence and carelessness could attract double or triple fines and lead to an erosion of your company’s market value.

Your IT security department must be well equipped to investigate all possible aspects of a data breach, the extent of the breach and the origin of the threat. Your data protection officer must pass all relevant insights to the concerned regulator within the prescribed time. You should also hire data protection counsel to have a foolproof “security incident response plan,” which should include these measures:

An operations team that informs affected persons without delay to avoid further damage. A dedicated team will inform any concerned individuals via emails or phone call.

External legal counsel with experience in handling data and privacy protection cases to help you navigate legal challenges.

A well-oiled public relations channel to manage public perception and make the data breach disclosure less painful.

A pool of insurance brokers and personnel to help you notify insurance carriers and submit loss claim notices.

A system reset procedure and data recovery protocol that makes the system cyber-attack-proof without impacting normal business operations.

There is no magic bullet for preventing personal data breaches, so companies must make conscious efforts to increase awareness throughout the organization and at all levels about (i) security threats and (ii) cybersecurity prevention techniques.

Therefore, it’s essential to ensure that your employees are aware of the types of threats they might receive as well as the techniques to prevent this from happening.

Although the consequences of this are not as obvious as those of traditional military attacks, the long-term impacts could be considerably more devastating.

Senator Mitt Romney calls the hack the high-tech equivalent of “Russian bombers repeatedly flying undetected over the entire country.” He argued over Sirius Radio that, while Russia was not dropping bombs, the hack showed “that [America’s] cyber warfare readiness is extraordinarily weak, that they think so little of our ability to fight back from a cyber standpoint that they do this with impunity.”

“It’s pretty hard to distinguish this from an act of aggression that rises to the level of an attack that qualifies as war,” Senator Chris Coons told MSNBC. “(T)his is as destructive and broad-scale an engagement with our military systems, our intelligence systems as has happened in my lifetime.”

Thomas Bossert, Trump’s former homeland security adviser, thinks similarly. “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,” he wrote in the New York Times

Why is this attack so potentially dangerous? The answer lies in the uncertainties that remain surrounding the hack. One of the agencies reporting a breach was the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which is the United States’ federal agency responsible for managing, and ensuring the safety of, the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Although the groups said that the malware was isolated to business networks and didn’t affect national security functions, it is not at all hard to imagine what could happen if an adversarial government accessed and controlled another country’s nuclear assets. The targets of state-sponsored cyberattacks are often intellectual property, elections, control of power grids, and hydroelectric dams – all of which have potentially significant impacts on a nation’s infrastructure.

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal counsel, said the recent attack represented “a broad and successful espionage-based assault on both the confidential information of the U.S. government and the tech tools used by firms to protect them.”

The attack was not limited to the U.S. alone. According to Smith, Canada and Mexico in North America; Belgium, Spain, and the United Kingdom in Europe; and Israel and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East were also compromised. “It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing,” he warned.

The U.S. has yet to officially respond to the attack, although Donald Trump tweeted on December 19th that the “Fake News Media” is exaggerating the extent of the hack. Contrary to his own intelligence and national security experts, Trump has claimed China may be responsible, deflecting any acknowledgement of Russia’s involvement.

President-elect Joe Biden, on the other hand, said that the suspected Russian cyberattack “is a matter of great concern” and promised to impose “substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in coordination with our allies and partners. Our adversaries should know that, as president, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation.”"

Data stolen in a cyberattack against a London council last year has been leaked online by the hackers responsible for the attack.

Hackney Council, which provides services for 280,000 residents in the UK capital, was hit by what was labeled a ""serious"" cyberattack last October, taking many IT systems out of operation, with some still disrupted currently.

It now appears that the information that was stolen during the attack has been published to the dark web by the criminals, although the council said that only a limited set of data was at risk. According to the council's latest update, the documents have not been leaked to a ""widely available forum"", and are not visible through search engines on the internet.

SEE: Network security policy (TechRepublic Premium)

The Mayor of Hackney Philip Glanville said: ""I fully understand and share the concern of residents and staff about any risk to their personal data, and we are working as quickly as possible with our partners to assess the data and take action, including informing people who are affected.

""While we believe this publication will not directly affect the vast majority of Hackney's residents and businesses, that can feel like cold comfort, and we are sorry for the worry and upset this will cause them.""

While the majority of sensitive and personal information held by the council appears to be unaffected, Hackney council said that it is working with the National Cyber Security Centre, the National Crime Agency, the Information Commissioner's Office and the Metropolitan Police to investigate what has been published exactly and assess which actions need to be taken.

Now several months after the attack happened, the exact nature of the intrusion is still unclear. The council has avoided disclosing details to make sure it does not inadvertently assist the attackers.

Only legacy and non-cloud-based systems, such as making payments or approving licensing, have been affected, while newer services and systems linked to managing the COVID-19 pandemic have remained up and running.

Although many systems have since been fully or partially restored, the council has already said that it expects some services to remain unavailable or disrupted for months to come.

Hackney Council's service status page still indicates that services are ""significantly disrupted"" due to a ""serious cyberattack"", and recommends that residents and businesses avoid contacting the council unless absolutely necessary.

SEE: How do we stop cyber weapons from getting out of control?

For example, the council is currently unable to process applications for most types of licenses, to add to the housing waiting list or for council tax reductions. Disruptions and delays to payment systems remain, as well as to claims for housing benefits. Voting preferences cannot be updated, and residents are currently unable to report noise complaints online.

Phone lines, however, remain open for essential help and emergency support.

""It is utterly deplorable that organised criminals chose last year to deliberately attack Hackney, damaging services and stealing from our borough, our staff, and our residents in this way, and all while we were in the middle of responding to a global pandemic,"" said Glanville.

""Now four months on, at the start of a new year and as we are all responding to the second wave, they have decided to compound that attack and now release stolen data. Working with our partners we will do everything we can to help bring them to justice.""

Although the extent of the data breach was never confirmed by the council, a criminal group known as Pysa/Mespinoza by security researchers has now published what it claims to be a range of sensitive information held by the authority.

The file names of the documents suggest the stolen files contain very sensitive information, including those with titles such as ""passportsdump"", ""staffdata"" and ""PhotoID"", although Sky News has not downloaded the information to verify it.

These documents were posted on a darknet website hosted by the criminals in which they list their victims and publish stolen data for extortion purposes.

Brett Callow, a researcher at cyber security company Emisoft, said: ""It's increasingly commonplace for ransomware groups to steal data and use the threat of its release as additional leverage to extort payment.

""Organisations in this position are without good option. Whether they pay or not, they've had a data breach and the criminals have their information. The most they can hope for is a pinky-promise that it will be destroyed.""

The NCSC guidance on ransomware attacks states that law enforcement ""do not encourage, endorse, nor condone the payment of ransom demands"" and warns: ""There is no guarantee that you will get access to your data or computer.""

The length of time that the council has struggled to deal with the impact of the attack suggests that no ransom was paid, although in some circumstances ransoms have been paid only for the data to prove unrecoverable.

A spokesperson for Hackney Council said: ""We are angry and disappointed that the organised criminals responsible for October's cyberattack have chosen to publish data stolen in October.

""We are working with the NCSC, National Crime Agency, Information Commissioner's Office, the Metropolitan Police and other experts to investigate what has been published and take immediate action where necessary.

""We understand and share the concern of residents about any risk to their personal data, and we are working as quickly as possible with our partners to assess the data and take action, including informing people who are affected.

Data stolen in a serious cyber attack on Hackney Council has been published on the dark web, it has been revealed.

The attack left multiple systems at the Town Hall paralysed and even affected the local property market, with speculation rife that it had been carried out through ransomware, which prevents access to a target computer system or data unless the attacker is paid by the victim.

The Town Hall has refused to confirm the nature of the attack since it took place in October, but now images published by Sky News appear to show screenshots of material made available through the use of ransomware tool Pysa/Mespinoza, with filenames shown including terms such as Staff Data, Passports, Complaints Community Safety, and Tenancy Audits.

Cyber security expert Luke Mead, CEO of IT company LMS Group, said: “Going back to when it happened, it was evidently clear that it was a ransomware attack. It’s not a first that this has happened, in cyber criminals threatening or going forward and publishing information on the dark web.

“I believe it will set a precedent moving forward – cyber crime is most definitely developing. My perception from an outside point of view would be that what has happened here is that the cyber criminals have run their ransomware attack, have held the council to extortion to say they demand a ransom to unlock the encrypted files or systems.

“My gut feeling would be that the council have said ‘No’, we’re not paying the ransom, at which point they have said ‘OK, we will publish this information on the dark web unless you pay us’. One would assume either that payment hasn’t gone ahead, or it has and nonetheless they still move forward.

“Nowadays information and data is really worth more than gold and oil. With someone’s identification you can take out credit in their name and that person can fall victim of identity theft without them knowing.

“It is pretty widespread knowledge that many local authorities are not up to date with IT best practice. Given that Hackney has fallen foul here, it is a big red flag for local authorities.

“If you are aiming for low-hanging fruit, would I hack a bank to take money, or take the easy route by hacking a local authority and thereby have a wider chance of obtaining funds from individuals?”

Experts supporting the council in their investigation are of the belief that what has been published is a limited set of data, pointing also to the fact that it has not been published on a widely available public forum and is not visible on internet search engines.

The council were unable to comment on whether they have received any communications from the criminals due to the ongoing investigation, or to confirm whether the images of the file names published by Sky News showing titles such as Tenancy Audit Scans were an accurate reflection of their contents.

Tenancy audits are surveys of residents to establish whether a council home is being looked after correctly, or if the property is being sublet.

Councils use survey forms during the audits to collect identification, demographic information, a household’s composition, contact details, income, and benefits. Identification provided can include utility bills, bank statements, passports, birth certificates, driving licences, or letters from government departments.

In accounts of other attacks on French local authorities using Pysa outlined by the Agence Nationale de la Securite des Systemes d’Information, standard messages were received by victims stating: “To get all your data back contact us.” One showed an offer of a free decryption of two files as proof of good faith.

Anti-malware advice published by NHS Digital on Pysa says that the tool was first observed in October 2019, and defines it as a “human-operated ransom tool created by an as yet unidentified advanced persistent threat group”.

The council has not revealed any details as to how the attack took place, but it is understood that it can potentially either be distributed through so-called ‘brute-force’ attacks, in which an attacker tries all possible passwords and phrases for a system, or through spam or phishing email campaigns.

Hackney Mayor Philip Glanville said: “It is utterly deplorable that organised criminals chose last year to deliberately attack Hackney, damaging services and stealing from our borough, our staff, and our residents in this way, and all while we were in the middle of responding to a global pandemic.

“Now, four months on, at the start of a new year and as we are all responding to the second wave, they have decided to compound that attack and now release stolen data. Working with our partners we will do everything we can to help bring them to justice.

“We are already working closely with the police and other partners to assess any immediate actions we need to take, and will share further information about the additional action we will be taking as soon as we can.”

A council spokesperson added: “Council staff are working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre, National Crime Agency (NCA), Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the Metropolitan Police and other experts to investigate what has been published and take immediate action where necessary.

“At this stage, it appears that the vast majority of the sensitive or personal information held by the council is unaffected, but the council and its partners are reviewing the data carefully and will support anyone directly affected.”

An ICO spokesperson said: ”People have the right to expect that their personal information is handled securely by any organisation. When this isn’t the case, it can cause real distress – especially if it is sensitive information.

“We received a data breach report from the London Borough of Hackney in 2020, and our investigation is continuing. If anyone is concerned about their personal information they should contact the council first, if they are not satisfied, they can bring their concerns to us.”

An NCA spokesperson said: “We are aware that information has been published online as a result of a cyber incident affecting Hackney Borough Council. NCA officers are working closely with the council and the Metropolitan Police Service to manage any risk.”

Maersk has denied that a communications outage today was a new cyber-attack.

The shipping line confirmed it had experienced “IT network issues impacting the connectivity across AP Møller-Maersk”.

“This means employees are experiencing issues with logging-on to the central IT network and our service centres, and online booking functionalities such as maersk.com are affected.”

He later added that the network issues were “related to one of our external network providers”.

He explained: “The provider believes they have identified and fixed the issue and, currently, our Maersk services are recovering globally.”

The issue sent the market into speculation about a second cyber-attack at the company, with one senior logistics source saying he “couldn’t see a CIO surviving two cyber-attacks”.

Pundits are pushing risk management as the way to go when it comes to maintaining cybersecurity. At first glance, that might be construed as giving up on current technology, but that’s not the whole picture.

Risk management is a way to have everything humanly possible in place to lessen the fallout from a cybersecurity event, and that is a good thing. Another equally important function of risk management is that it can be considered a proactive methodology used to identify risks in an organization’s cybersecurity framework.

Business owners and managers have very different mindsets than cybercriminals. Sufficient margins and cutting costs fill leaders’ days. Cybercriminals are much more focused–they’re simply looking for ways to make money illegally, whether by stealing lucrative data and selling it, or extorting ransom money from a business by encrypting important digital files. When neither party considers the other, bad things usually happen.

SEE: Checklist: Security Risk Assessment (TechRepublic Premium)

The EconoTimes article “Using Risk Management to Identify Gaps in Cybersecurity” defines risk management as a proactive mindset intent on making it more difficult for cybercriminals:

“Risk assessment allows the security team to identify threats and risks. This enables them to close any gaps and give proper security to sensitive data. The evaluation also addresses compliance and regulatory requirements for PCI DSS as well as HIPAA.”

Automated scanning software

Most companies are running lean financially and having a third-party vendor perform a risk-management assessment is expensive and limited in scope, according to the article. The article’s author suggests: “Companies may choose to perform risk assessments internally. SaaS platforms have made this possible by offering automated testing, reports, and monitoring. One of the best approaches to risk management is the use of automated-scanning software.”

This type of software offers the following:

Scanning tools able to detect risk in the company’s network, hardware, and databases;

breach- and attack-simulation tools; and

vulnerability-assessment platforms.

From the article: “The tools will then report the issues discovered and offer suggestions on how to combat them.” The author added that when choosing a risk-assessment tool, it is important to consider how often the tool is updated, how easy it is to act on the results, and how well the tool interacts with other cybersecurity tools.

SEE: Identity theft protection policy (TechRepublic Premium)

All departments should be involved

The only way risk assessment is going to work is if all departments are involved, as well as key management players.

“Although this process can be time-consuming, do not skip it,” the author of the EconoTimes article wrote, adding that particular attention should be paid to departments dealing directly with consumer and company data.

The whole point of this type of risk management is to proactively identify cybersecurity risks and remove the risk if possible; if that’s not possible, develop responses that will reduce the impact if a cyberattack does occur. On how to accomplish this, here are tips from the EconoTimes article.

Develop a culture: Businesses are not in the habit of thinking cyber-securely, and that has to change, she said. In particular, all employees must buy into an organization’s security culture.

Educate employees: The article’s author says cybersecurity is not just the responsibility of the IT department: All personnel need to recognize when an attack is occurring and know their roles in mitigating the damage. The author takes it a step further and believes it is vital that every employee understand that a serious cyberattack could mean loss of employment if the company has to close its doors. From the EconoTimes article: “Communicate your plans on risk mitigation to all stakeholders, and keep them involved.”

Create a cybersecurity framework: The National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) describes a cybersecurity framework as, “Voluntary guidance, based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. In addition to helping organizations manage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and cybersecurity management communications among both internal and external organizational stakeholders.”

The author’s article states the right cybersecurity framework is important. From the article: “Your standards will dictate the right framework. Most companies adopt PCC DSS, CIS Critical Security Controls, and ISO 27001/27002.”

As part of that framework, each company should create a risk-assessment matrix, including quantitative and qualitative risk reviews. “The assessment should give you a detailed analysis and highlight the risks likely to occur,” says the EconoTimes article’s author, who suggests internal as well as external stakeholders be involved in the reviews.

Mitigate cybersecurity risks

The EconoTimes article makes a good argument that risk management is more than how to recover from a cybersecurity event–it’s also a way to proactively reduce the risk of becoming a cyber victim. The more you know about your company’s risks, the more likely you are to mitigate them."

A joint statement issued by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence and National Security Agency characterized the hacking campaign as ""likely Russian in origin"" and responsible for perhaps all of the recently discovered compromises of public and private networks.

""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort,"" officials said in an acknowledgment that the attack is continuing weeks after the breach was made public. ""We are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly.""

The public attribution to Russia is the most definitive accounting yet after separate statements last month by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-Attorney General William Barr who both pointed to the Kremlin. Barr left the administration Dec. 23.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has sought to downplay the breach while suggesting that China was to blame for the attack. Trump has accused the news media of inflating the seriousness of the hacks and has repeatedly deflected blame from Russia, undermining his own administration’s warning last month that the attacks posed a “grave risk” to government networks and the private sector.

Pompeo: Russia 'pretty clearly' behind cyberattack on US, but Trump casts doubts and downplays threat

Cyber attack:Private sector, infrastructure, all levels of government at risk

Although federal authorities have so far traced the attack's launch back to March, it remains unclear just how long operatives have been lurking in some of the government's most critical agencies – including the departments of State, Homeland Security, Treasury and Commerce – and what may have been lost or compromised.

The U.S. has said the hackers employed sophisticated tactics not seen in past intrusions, complicating efforts to eliminate the threat.

The attackers penetrated federal computer systems through a popular piece of server software offered through a company called SolarWinds.

The threat apparently came from the same cyberespionage campaign that has afflicted cybersecurity firm FireEye, foreign governments and major corporations.

The system is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. federal agencies, which are now scrambling to patch their networks.

""Of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of SolarWinds' Orion products, a much smaller number has been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems,"" federal officials said in the Tuesday statement. ""We have so far identified fewer than 10 U.S. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify the non-government entities who also may be impacted.

""This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" the officials said.

The Russian government did not immediately respond.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the administration's statement was slow in coming.

“It’s unfortunate that it has taken over three weeks after the revelation of an intrusion this significant for this Administration to finally issue a tentative attribution,"" Warner said. ""I would hope that we will begin to see something more definitive, along with a more public pronouncement of U.S. policy towards indiscriminate supply chain infiltrations of this sort in the future.

""We need to make clear to Russia that any misuse of compromised networks to produce destructive or harmful effects is unacceptable and will prompt an appropriately strong response,"" he said."

New Zealand's central bank said on Monday a cyberattack that breached its data systems also affected other users of a third-party application and that it was not a specific target of the hack.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said a file-sharing service provided by California-based Accellion was illegally accessed.

RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said the file-sharing service, used by the bank to share information with external stakeholders, has been taken offline during investigations and that it would take time to determine the full impact of the breach.

""We have been advised by the third-party provider that this wasn't a specific attack on the Reserve Bank, and other users of the file-sharing application were also compromised,"" Orr said in a statement.

RBNZ declined to provide further details on who was behind the attack and how it was discovered, saying such information could affect the investigation and efforts to contain the breach.

""Our core functions and New Zealand's financial system remain sound,"" said Orr.

""This includes our markets operations and management of the cash and payments systems.""

This breach comes just months after New Zealand's stock exchange operator was targeted in a series of distributed denial of service attacks that overwhelmed its website.

Dave Parry, Professor of Computer Science at Auckland University of Technology, said the attack on RBNZ was more sophisticated than the one on the exchange, and that the possibility of state-backed actors' involvement could not be ruled out.

""Past attacks have been identified as state-backed so the government would be looking closely into this,"" he said.

RBNZ has said it was working with domestic and international cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident.

There has been an escalation in cyberattacks over the past year, with the government Computer Emergency Response Team saying attacks reached a record high last year.

Then the Insider Trading.,https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1pzfhkhcv70m1/First-the-Cyberattack-Hits-Then-the-Insider-Trading,"Using firm-level historical options trading activity from OptionMetrics, we investigated informed trading activity in equity options prior to firms’ cybersecurity breach disclosures.
More informed trading is also significantly associated with lower quality compliance controls in breached firms.
Since then, increased scrutiny of breaches and greater awareness of trading around them have resulted in a decrease in informed trading before official announcements.
Exploitation + EnforcementOurs is among the first studies to use options trading data to analyze breach-related informed trading prior to the public disclosure of a breach event.
For more information, see “Trading Ahead of the Disclosure: Cybersecurity Breaches and Informed Trading.”","cyberattack, breaches, investors, disclosure, breach, information, insider, options, hits, informed, activity, trading, data",cyberattack,cyberattack,"When companies get hacked, do their own employees and informed outsiders use that information in trading before the breach is disclosed?

The answer is yes, according to our latest research.



The Equifax case — a breach that jeopardized the personal data of up to 143 million people but went unreported for more than a month after surfacing — is a good example of how things can go south quickly. The weeks-long disclosure gap provided abundant opportunity for those in the know to take advantage of the information, and insiders did.



Using firm-level historical options trading activity from OptionMetrics, we investigated informed trading activity in equity options prior to firms’ cybersecurity breach disclosures. We found pervasive directional options activity, consistent with strategies that yield abnormal returns to investors with private information.



This research follows on our previous work showing that many firms leverage discretion on when they reveal a breach. While some sectors, such as healthcare, have strict rules around disclosure, firms in less regulated industries often take advantage of variations in reporting requirements, sometimes not releasing information for an extraordinary length of time. However, a delay in disclosing the information is sometimes a result of the companies’ trying to get a handle on the situation so that when they do make an announcement, the impact may be less, as they can show what they have done about it.



Importantly, there is a cost of disclosure, and delayed reporting of breaches creates informed trading opportunities. Firms and management that choose to disclose a breach can face fines and costly litigation, potentially risking client relationships, reducing access to financing, and increasing insurance premiums. Conversely, choosing silence means they may be able to avoid these costs altogether. If the information does eventually come out, their added risks may include some extra fees or penalties that can be insignificant compared to the total cost of litigation.



Finally, unless the company voluntarily discloses it was the source of a breach, it may be difficult to trace where it happened. This uncertain traceability creates further disincentives to disclose. For instance, Target Corp. revealed that in December 2013, hundreds of millions of sets of personal information were compromised. However, for other companies that do not make a disclosure, it may be difficult to trace the source to them, as breaches can affect more than one organization at a time.

Trading Prior to Cybersecurity Disclosures

To arrive at our conclusions, we examined public sources of data breaches from 2005 through 2018 to analyze the impact of incidents on public companies. We considered numerous aspects of the firms, including history, data breach characteristics, and other variables, to determine whether breaches are more likely to happen with larger or smaller firms, and in which types of industries.



We leveraged OptionMetrics data to analyze behavioral approaches to trading, including looking at potential strategies informed investors might use to maximize profits or minimize risk.



We looked at specific cases where investors might try to avoid large losses associated with upcoming negative news about a cybersecurity incident at their firm, and we also looked at the behavior of investors who might be aware of a breach and want to maximize their profits. To ensure that the data was randomized, we controlled for earnings announcements and other timely news activity. We also compared these behaviors to how investors might otherwise react on a daily basis.



We found pervasive directional options trading activity consistent with strategies that yield abnormal returns to investors who possess pre-disclosure breach information, supporting our hypothesis that informed trading associated with data breach announcements does happen. We found two types of options trading activity: one commonly associated with less sophisticated investors using pre-breach disclosure information to gain profits or hedge losses and another often observed among more experienced investors using more sophisticated strategies involving puts and calls.



We observed bearish call and hedging put strategies increasing prior to the official breach announcements. These effects were most significant for out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and in-the-money put options, which typically have the highest liquidity. Additionally, we found a spike in investors buying insurance against a stock crashing right before that company told the world it had been hacked. An increase in deep out-of-the-money trades indicates that informed investors expect negative news in the future. We also saw that the options trading activity before a firm’s breach disclosure was related to the negative abnormal stock returns the firm experienced after the disclosure. Thus the pre-disclosure trading activity was consistent with informed investors profiting from or buying insurance against a stock crashing right before the company told the world it had been hacked.



More informed trading is also significantly associated with lower quality compliance controls in breached firms.



The Scrutiny Effect

An overall structural shift toward greater awareness about data breaches can be observed since October 2009. Since then, increased scrutiny of breaches and greater awareness of trading around them have resulted in a decrease in informed trading before official announcements.



While during the early years cybersecurity drew less attention, we observe interest changing over time, with a sharp rise in Google queries in October 2009 that has stayed relatively high since. We attribute the increased awareness to President Obama’s promoting awareness in many of his speeches and the promotion of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which since 2009 has held a theme during its celebration every October. Additionally, two big data breaches happened prior to October 2009 — at Heartland Payment Systems, impacting more than 130 million accounts, and at the National Archives and Records Administration, affecting millions of U.S. military veterans — prompting people to think about security more.



Exploitation + Enforcement

Ours is among the first studies to use options trading data to analyze breach-related informed trading prior to the public disclosure of a breach event.



Unlike with short-selling in the stock market, which might gain a lot of attention, the reasons for options trades are often harder to identify and trace, and therefore may be less risky for informed traders. One might also more inexpensively leverage options positions. As such, the options market might be a good place to look to reveal negative news on breaches sooner.



Findings on the level of internal controls for reporting breaches and how they impact the likelihood of informed trading activity are also revealing. Much like with using a camera in a store to discourage theft, it appears that if regulatory controls are high, they may reduce informed trading around breaches. Conversely, if reporting requirements are low, it may be easier for someone outside of the investigation team to obtain, and trade on, information on a breach.



We hope these insights will help the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory entities as they assess the need for initiatives in data-breach information handling and disclosure to reduce the likelihood of nonpublic information-based trading before official breach announcements.



Our research findings confirm the importance of having a unified legal and regulatory framework in place — and the presence of profiteers who exploit its absence.

As a prime target for cybercriminals, financial service organisations must prioritise their cybersecurity.","email, cybersecurity, target, cyberattacks, threats, information, organisations, sensitive, prime, attacks, businesses, security, financial",cyberattack,cyberattack,"Businesses of all sizes are targets for cyberattacks, financial institutions much more so than most. Andrea Babbs , UK general manager of VIPRE SafeSend believes it is time for them to step up their security infrastructure.

With over 20 years of experience in the IT industry, she has worked for security vendors and resellers dealing with email, endpoint and web security, watching the threat landscape change from simple viruses and spam to the sophisticated, polymorphic threats of today.

With humans the last line of defence, education and effective tools are needed to help them prevent making small mistakes with big consequences. In this article, Andrea explains why financial organisations are a prime target for cyberattacks and ransomware threats, and what they can do going forward to mitigate the risks.

The financial services industry deals with highly sensitive information, including monetary transactions, personal information and financial data, all of which are the Holy Grail for cybercriminals. The consequences of this information falling into the wrong hands could mean the loss of significant sums of money, including financial penalties, costs for audits to understand why the incident happened and what additional protocols need to be implemented going forward.

Accenture’s 2019 Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime report, found that financial services incurred the highest cybercrime costs of all industries. Additionally, the fallout from data breaches goes far beyond financial costs. Financial services businesses have reputations to uphold in order to maintain a loyal customer base. If they fail to protect their customers’ sensitive information, they will have to manage the negative press and mistrust from existing and potential customers.

In such a highly competitive market, it doesn’t take much for customers to take their money elsewhere. While examples of external threats make the headlines, such as the Capital One cyber incident, unintentional breaches don’t always gain as much attention.

The Importance of Email and Unintentional Breaches

Despite this, human errors, including misdeliveries via email, are almost twice as likely to result in confirmed data disclosure. One of the biggest threats to an organisation’s security infrastructure is over-reliance on email. With remote working becoming the norm for many businesses in 2020, it is arguably more important than ever as a communication tool.

Humans are only ever a click away from sending an email with the wrong attachment, or to the wrong contact. But this can be more than just an embarrassing mistake – the ramifications could, in fact, be catastrophic.

Cyber attacks, especially against banks and those working in finance, have increased dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with a 238% surge in financially-motivated attacks, according to the third edition of VMware’s Modern Bank Heists report. Many of these attacks are COVID-related in nature, linking to accessing loans to help businesses or fake government emails as highlighted by UK Finance. In turn, 96% of UK executives said they will shift their cybersecurity strategy due to COVID-19, according to a recent study by PwC.

2020 may have been the catalyst for businesses to improve their understanding of cyber threats and the vulnerabilities they exploit as they plan for the new normal, but how can they do this successfully?

Within the financial services sector, the stakes are high, so an effective, layered cybersecurity strategy is essential to reduce risk and keep sensitive information secure. Security protocols are designed to prevent most instances of unauthorised interception and email spoofing. Adding a dedicated email-to-email encryption service to your email security arsenal also increases your protection in this area.

Data Loss Prevention Solutions

Financial organisations can deploy innovative technology solutions to educate their workforce in real-time. This includes Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, which enable the firm to implement security measures for the detection, control and prevention of risky email sending behaviours. Rather than impeding the working practices of users, these tools instead give the employee a critical second chance to double-check their email is going to the right person.

It is this double-check that can be the critical factor in an organisation’s cybersecurity efforts.

Security guidelines and rules regarding the circulation and storage of sensitive financial information are essential, as well as clear steps to follow when a security incident happens.

Training the Workforce

Cybersecurity awareness training should be implemented as soon as an employee joins a company, and should be an ongoing programme with quarterly or monthly short, informative sessions. This training should also incorporate phishing simulations and attacks to demonstrate to users how these incidents can appear, and educate them on how to spot and flag them accordingly.

This reinforcement of security messaging, working in tandem with simulated phishing attacks ensures that everyone is capable of spotting a phishing scam and knows how to handle sensitive information.

Moving forward, cybersecurity should be at the forefront of all businesses’ agendas. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals, coupled with the rapid shift of digital technologies brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of a strong security infrastructure.

As a prime target for cybercriminals, financial service organisations must prioritise their cybersecurity. This includes regularly assessing risks, deploying innovative, human-led solutions and educating workforces to provide the best defence possible. With a layered security strategy in place and a proactive approach to their cyber defences, the risks can be minimised."

Cybersecurity experts have said it could take months to identify all the compromised systems and expel the hackers. Russia has denied any involvement in the cyberattack.

Microsoft announced in late December that it was among the thousands of companies that found its systems compromised. It said that hackers gained access to its source code but said the activity did not put the security of its services or any customer data at risk.

The software giant had previously acknowledged that like U.S. government agencies and other firms, it had downloaded updates of network management software made by the company SolarWinds that the hackers had targeted. The compromised software provided hackers a backdoor into government and company networks.

Microsoft said at the time that the hacking operation was carried out by a “very sophisticated nation-state actor” and said companies and businesses affected were in several other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.

Bill Whitaker: What makes this so momentous?

Brad Smith: One of the really disconcerting aspects of this attack was the widespread and indiscriminate nature of it. What this attacker did was identify network management software from a company called SolarWinds. They installed malware into an update for a SolarWinds product. When that update went out to 18,000 organizations around the world, so did this malware.

The world still might not know about the hack if not for FireEye, a three-and-a-half billion dollar cybersecurity company run by Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer.

Kevin Mandia: I can tell you this, if we didn't do investigations for a living, we wouldn't have found this. It takes a very special skill set to reverse engineer a whole platform that's written by bad guys to never be found.

FireEye's core mission is to hunt, find, and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks of their clients - mostly governments and major companies. But FireEye used SolarWinds software, which turned the cyber hunter into the prey. This past November, one alert FireEye employee noticed something amiss.

Kevin Mandia: Just like everybody working from home, we have two-factor authentication. A code pops up on our phone. We have to type in that code. And then we can log in. A FireEye employee was logging in, but the difference was our security staff looked at the login and we noticed that individual had two phones registered to their name. So our security employee called that person up and we asked, ""Hey, did you actually register a second device on our network?"" And our employee said, ""No. It wasn't, it wasn't me.""

Suspicious, FireEye turned its gaze inward, and saw intruders impersonating its employees snooping around inside their network, stealing FireEye's proprietary tools to test its clients defenses and intelligence reports on active cyber threats. The hackers left no evidence of how they broke in – no phishing expeditions, no malware.

Bill Whitaker: So how did you trace this back to SolarWinds software?

Kevin Mandia: It was not easy. We took a lotta people and said, ""Turn every rock over. Look in every machine and find any trace of suspicious activity."" What kept coming back was the earliest evidence of compromise is the SolarWinds system. We finally decided: Tear the thing apart.

They discovered the malware inside SolarWinds and on December 13 informed the world of the brazen attack.

Kevin Mandia

Much of the damage had already been done. The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged the Russians spent months inside their computers accessing email traffic – but the department won't tell us exactly what was taken. It's the same at Treasury, Commerce, the NIH, Energy. Even the agency that protects and transports our nuclear arsenal. The hackers also hit the biggest names in high tech.

Bill Whitaker: So, what does that target list tell you?

Brad Smith: I think this target list tells us that this is clearly a foreign intelligence agency. It exposes the secrets potentially of the United States and other governments as well as private companies. I don't think anyone knows for certain how all of this information will be used. But we do know this: It is in the wrong hands.

And Microsoft's Brad Smith told us it's almost certain the hackers created additional backdoors and spread to other networks.

The revelation this past December came at a fraught time in the U.S. President Trump was disputing the election, and tweeted China might be responsible for the hack. Within hours he was contradicted by his own secretary of state and attorney general. They blamed Russia. The Department of Homeland Security, FBI and intelligence agencies concurred. The prime suspect: the SVR, one of several Russian spy agencies the U.S. labels ""advanced persistent threats."" Russia denies it was involved.

Brad Smith: I do think this was an act of recklessness. The world runs on software. It runs on information technology. But it can't run with confidence if major governments are disrupting and attacking the software supply chain in this way.

Bill Whitaker: That almost sounds like you think that they went in to foment chaos?

Brad Smith: What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the United States. But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine.

For years the Russians have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. NotPetya, a 2017 attack by the GRU, Russia's military spy agency, used the same tactics as the SolarWinds attack, sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks, but instead of spying - it ordered devices to self-destruct.

Brad Smith: It literally damaged more than 10% of that nation's computers in a single day. The television stations couldn't produce their shows because they relied on computers. Automated teller machines stopped working. Grocery stores couldn't take a credit card. Now, what we saw with this attack was something that was more targeted, but it just shows how if you engage in this kind of tactic, you can unleash an enormous amount of damage and havoc.

Bill Whitaker: It's hard to downplay the severity of this.

Chris Inglis: It is hard to downplay the severity of this. Because it's only a stone's throw from a computer network attack.

Chris Inglis

Chris Inglis spent 28 years commanding the nation's best cyber warriors at the National Security Agency – seven as its deputy director – and now sits on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission – created by Congress to come up with new ideas to defend our digital domain.

Bill Whitaker: Why didn't the government detect this?

Chris Inglis: The government is not looking on private sector networks. It doesn't surveil private sector networks. That's a responsibility that's given over to the private sector. FireEye found it on theirs, many others did not. The government did not find it on their network, so that's a disappointment.

Disappointment is an understatement. The Department of Homeland Security spent billions on a program called ""Einstein"" to detect cyber attacks on government agencies. The Russians outsmarted it. They circumvented the NSA, which gathers intelligence overseas, but is prohibited from surveilling U.S. computer networks. So the Russians launched their attacks from servers set up anonymously in the United States.

Bill Whitaker: This hack happened on American soil. It went through networks based in the United States. Are our defense capabilities constrained?

Chris Inglis: U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Department of Defense, can suggest what the intentions of other nations are based upon what they learn in their rightful work overseas. But they can't turn around and focus their unblinking eye on the domestic infrastructure. That winds up making it more difficult for us.

He says history shows that once inside a network, the Russians are a stubborn adversary.

Chris Inglis: It's hard to kind of get something like this completely out of the system. And they certainly don't understand all the places that it's gone to, all of the manifestations of where this virus, where this software still lives. And that's gonna take some time. And the only way you'll have absolute confidence that you've gotten rid of it is to get rid of the hardware, to get rid of the systems.

Bill Whitaker: Wow. So unless you get rid of all the computers and all the computer networks, you will not be sure that you have gotten this out of the systems.

Chris Inglis: You will not be.

Jon Miller: We've never been left with a breach like that before where we know months into it that we're only looking at the tip of the iceberg.

Jon Miller

It's not everyday you meet someone who builds cyber weapons as complex as those deployed by Russian intelligence. But Jon Miller, who started off as a hacker and now runs a company called Boldend, designs and sells cutting-edge cyber weapons to U.S. intelligence agencies.

Jon Miller: I build things much more sophisticated than this. What's impressive is the scope of it. This is a watershed style attack. I would never do something like this. It creates too much damage.

Miller says with the SolarWinds attack, Russia has demonstrated that none of the software we take for granted is truly safe, including the apps on our telephones, laptops, and tablets. These days, he says, any device can be sabotaged.

Jon Miller: When you buy something from a tech company, a new phone or a laptop, you trust that that is secure when they give it to you. And what they've shown us in this attack is that is not the case. They have the ability to compromise those supply chains and manipulate whatever they want. Whether it's financial data, source code, the functionality of these products. They can take control.

Bill Whitaker: So, for instance, they could destroy all the computers on a network?

Jon Miller: Oh, easily. The malware that they deployed off of SolarWinds, it didn't have the functionality in it to do that. But to do that is trivial. Couple dozen lines of code.

Bill Whitaker: And there're still some companies that don't yet know they were breached?

Jon Miller: It's still ongoing. New companies are getting breached. We'll see new companies breached today that weren't breached this morning. Where it's different in a lot of ways is normally when you catch someone in the act, they stop. That's not the case with this breach.

France's cybersecurity agency ANSSI on Monday said ""several French entities"" had been breached, and linked the attacks to a Russian hacker group thought to be behind some of the most devastating cyberattacks in past years.

The agency said it had identified ""an intrusion campaign"" in which hackers, linked to Russian military intelligence agency GRU, compromised the French software firm Centreon in order to install two pieces of malware into its clients' networks. The ""supply chain attack"" is similar to the recently discovered compromise of U.S. business software SolarWinds that breached several U.S. government agencies and many others.

The intrusion campaign started in late 2017 and lasted until 2020, ANSSI said, adding it ""mostly affected information technology providers, especially web hosting providers.""

Centreon said in a statement it ""has taken note of the information,"" adding it is ""not proven at this stage that the identified vulnerability concerns a commercial version provided by Centreon over the period in question.""

The company lists Airbus, Air France, Thales, ArcelorMittal, Électricité de France (EDF) and telecoms firm Orange among its clients, as well as the French Ministry of Justice. It's unclear how many or which organizations were breached via the software hack.

ANSSI said that the campaign ""bears several similarities with previous campaigns attributed to the intrusion set named Sandworm,"" which ""is known to lead consequent intrusion campaigns before focusing on specific targets that fits its strategic interests within the victims pool.""

The hacker group Sandworm has been linked to GRU by cybersecurity authorities and experts. The group is thought to be behind some of the most damaging cyberattacks in recent history, including the outbreak of ransomware NotPetya in 2017 and attacks on the Winter Olympics in South Korea.

European diplomats imposed sanctions on several officers of Russia's intelligence unit linked to Sandworm in relation to the cyberattacks. U.S. authorities also indicted hackers belonging to the same group and said the group was suspected of being behind the 2017 cyberattack on then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s party La République En Marche.

The Yonhap agency said the revelation was made during a closed-door meeting of the intelligence committee of South Korea’s National Assembly.
With the race for COVID-19 vaccines now in high gear, and drugmakers under increased pressure to develop jabs and supply them in high quantities, the vulnerabilities are becoming more acute.
North Korea is reported to be in line to receive nearly two million doses of the AZ COVID-19 vaccine in the first half of this year through the international COVAX vaccine distribution programme.
And last year, Europol warned that criminal networks were exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic with a surge in cybercrime.","cyberattack, jab, vaccine, pharma, intelligence, vaccines, covid19, services, national, information, agency, north, hackers, korea, launched, pfizer, data",cyberattack,cyberattack,"A news agency is claiming that North Korea launched a cyber-attack on Pfizer in a bid to steal information about its BioNTech-partnered COVID-19 vaccine, citing South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS).

The Yonhap agency said the revelation was made during a closed-door meeting of the intelligence committee of South Korea’s National Assembly.

According to recent Deloitte report, the pharma industry is often the number one target of cybercriminals – either private or state-sanctioned – as drugmakers move toward increased digitisation and storing of highly valuable data online.

Many pharma manufacturing and R&D facilities rely on connected technology to automate processes, and this connectivity makes them more susceptible to attack by increasing the number of internet-connected points that must be protected.

With the race for COVID-19 vaccines now in high gear, and drugmakers under increased pressure to develop jabs and supply them in high quantities, the vulnerabilities are becoming more acute. A Reuters report suggests that in this case the intention may have been to sell on the data rather than using it to develop a rival shot.

Last July, the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US – in tandem with cybersecurity authorities in the UK and Canada – issued an alert accusing Russian intelligence services of targeting COVID-19 research and vaccine development facilities with cyber-attacks.

“Staff are working faster, harder and longer hours than ever before,” says Jack Garnsey of cybersecurity specialist VIPRE. “In turn, this can have an effect on their cyber awareness as it falls to the bottom of their priority lists.”

Any significant delay caused by these cyber threats and hackers could endanger the lives of millions of people, as well as impact the investment that goes into making the medicines.

There’s no questioning that the development of COVID-19 vaccines and access to them has become prone to politicking however, as can be seen with the recent spat between AstraZeneca and the EU, and Russia’s declaration that it will not seek approval of its Sputnik V shot in the US.

North Korea is reported to be in line to receive nearly two million doses of the AZ COVID-19 vaccine in the first half of this year through the international COVAX vaccine distribution programme.

While stealing sensitive or valuable information is a perennial goal of hackers, often pharma companies are targeted by ransomware – such as the notorious NotPetya malware strike on Merck & Co in 2017 which took down 30,000 computers and other devices and 7,500 servers and also affected other multinational corporations like shipping giant Maersk.

That caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, lost sales and remediation costs and, according to the US intelligence services, was a side effect of a campaign carried out by Russian military hackers that was directed against infrastructure in Ukraine.

Since the Merck incident, there have also been attacks against Bayer – which suffered a year-long assault thought to originate from the China-based Winnti hacking group, as well as Pfizer, Charles River Laboratories, and Fresenius.

In 2015, online security specialist Kaspersky revealed in a blog post that Winnti had started targeting pharma companies, possibly for the purpose of carrying out industrial espionage. And last year, Europol warned that criminal networks were exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic with a surge in cybercrime.

Some attacks are aimed at stealing intellectual property (IP) related to new vaccines or treatments, it said, while others seek to scam consumers forced to carry out more activities online, or simply to disrupt healthcare services – possibly for ransom purposes but sometimes with no obvious intent.

An example of the latter was seemingly launched on Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic amid the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, shutting down its IT networks and resulting in the postponing of urgent surgeries and rerouting of new acute patients to a nearby alternative facility."

A hacker gained access to an Oldsmar, Fla. city computer on Feb. 5 and changed the level of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, local authorities said. It isn’t yet known whether the breach originated from the U.S. or from outside the country. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is working with local authorities.

There’s been a “marked increase” in the last couple of years in cyber incidents against state and local government entities, said David Springer, a cybersecurity attorney at Bracewell LLP in Austin, Texas.

“A number of people have been calling this incident a wake-up call, but there have been reported attacks like this for 20 years now,” Springer said. “I’m glad it’s bringing attention to the security of industrial and municipal control systems.”

Water Systems Vulnerable

Vulnerability to cyberattacks varies across the 51,000 community water systems nationwide, said J. Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.

“This needs to be elevated within the water sector,” because systems are too critical to be allowed to go down due to a cyberattack, he said.

The country’s largest water systems are the best prepared for cyberattacks because they’ve heavily invested in addressing security threats, Roberson noted.

One of the largest is American Water Works Company Inc., which said Tuesday that it acknowledges the severity of cyber threats and is working with state and federal agencies to prepare for them, spokesman Joseph Szafran said.

“American Water has a dedicated team of certified professionals who help maintain the cybersecurity of our informational and operational technology systems; safeguard the physical security of our staff, facilities and assets; and provide emergency response and business continuity activities,” Szafran said in an email.

Critical Infrastructure Risk

Guarding people’s privacy and protecting their personal information remains a top priority, but cyber hits to critical infrastructure should serve as reminders that bad actors can inflict real-world physical harm, said Paul Luehr, co-leader of Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP’s privacy and cybersecurity team.

“The Florida event shows cybersecurity isn’t always about personal data—it’s also about personal safety,” he said.

That a plant worker was able to quickly lower the chemical levels back to normal and prevent public harm reinforces how administrative, physical, and technical controls—including employee training—are vital to keeping systems secure, he said.

Critical infrastructure such as dams, power plants, and hospitals are attractive targets for bad actors and have increasingly been targeted in ransomware hits, said Greg Szewczyk, a privacy and cybersecurity partner at Ballard Spahr LLP in Denver.

It’s common for those types of entities to be targeted by nation-state actors, he said, but regardless of attacker type, businesses and municipal entities alike need to think about operational and organizational responsibilities, he said.

“They need to consider data security beyond the mere confines of guarding personal information,” Szewczyk said. “They should be regularly assessing cyber threats, identifying individual vulnerabilities, and adopting proper security measures.”

Tools Available

A cyberattack against a drinking water system emphasizes the need for water utilities to implement existing best practices, said Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations for the American Water Works Association.

The association provides its members with cybersecurity assessment tools that they should use following the Feb. 5 attack, Morley said.

“We would encourage those utilities to go do that assessment,” he said. “We are one of the many targets that various adversaries are seeking to take advantage of.”

The federal government through the Environmental Protection Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency provides some tools water systems can use to assess their vulnerability, Roberson said.

But Roberson said EPA’s guidance is limited. The EPA provides an online vulnerability self-assessment tool that addresses cybersecurity and natural hazards, and a four-page brief on how states can address cybersecurity, he said.

The brief outlines how drinking water and wastewater systems can benefit from adopting a cybersecurity program.

“EPA has tools to assist water and wastewater utilities in preparing for, identifying, responding to, and recovering from cyber-attacks,” the EPA said in a statement provided by spokesman Nick Conger.

“To provide utilities with the most current resources, EPA has developed a website that utilities can reference to find the most updated alerts, information, and tools that may be used to improve cyber resilience,” the statement said.

CISA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Compliance Insufficient

The Florida attack showed that a more sophisticated breach may go unnoticed, said Jerry Ray, chief operating officer of the security firm SecureAge Technology.

“Current regulations aren’t addressing real security threats that they’re faced with, this one being so low-level, so ham-fisted,” Ray said. “If this were a foreign adversary—someone with a real intent—those tracks wouldn’t be visible.”

Regulatory compliance and security safeguards most water utilities have in place are insufficient to protect them against future breaches, he said.

“Everything we’ve got in place is not enough,” Ray said. “Regulatory compliance is where you start.”

Municipalities should lean on state and federal resources to better their security systems, Springer said. Getting training and financial support from larger organizations can help them beef up their cybersecurity defenses, he said.

“There’s a very real risk of malicious actors getting into systems that control vital functions,” Springer said. “That’s not new—but it’s always a good time to refocus attention on it.”

The Biden administration has an opportunity in the wake of this attack to evaluate the nation’s collective defense model, said Evan Wolff, co-chair of Crowell & Moring LLP’s privacy and cybersecurity group.

“It’s going to take a coordinated and proactive response of organizations, the federal government, and the security community working together,” Wolff said."

Spotify streaming music aficionados are in the crosshairs of yet another credential-stuffing cyberattack, just three months after the last one. The service has forced password resets for impacted users.

Cybercriminals carrying out credential-stuffing take advantage of people who reuse the same passwords across multiple online accounts. Attackers simply build automated scripts that systematically try stolen IDs and passwords (either gleaned from a breach of another company or website, or purchased online) against various types of accounts.

Cybercriminals have successfully leveraged the approach to steal data from various popular companies’ customers, including big names like the North Face, Dunkin Donuts (which was also hit twice in three months) and popular chicken-dinner chain Nando’s. And last year, FC Barcelona’s official Twitter account was hacked in an apparent credential-stuffing attack.

Replay: A Second Credential-Stuffing Attack for Spotify

Back in November, cybercriminals attacked hundreds of thousands of Spotify users utilizing this approach, prompting the streaming music service to issue password-reset notices.

Researcher Bob Diachenko tweeted about the new Spotify attack on Thursday: “I have uncovered a malicious #Spotify logger database, with 100K+ account details (leaked elsewhere online) being misused and compromised as part of a credential stuffing attack.”

He also posted a Spotify statement on the incident that confirmed the attack.

“We recently protected some of our users against [a credential-stuffing attack],” the notice read. “Once we became aware of the situation, we issued password resets to all impacted users, which rendered the public credentials invalid.”

The company also noted that the attacks were carried out using an ill-gotten set of data: “We worked to have the fraudulent database taken down by the ISP hosting it.”

Cybercriminals Misconfigure the Cloud Too

In the first Spotify incident in November, researchers found a misconfigured and open Elasticsearch cloud database containing more than 380 million individual records, including login credentials and countries of residence for various people, all being actively being validated against Spotify accounts. The database was owned by a malicious third party, researchers said at the time.

This second attack is very similar, with the log-in data also exposed in a public Elasticsearch instance.

“There are similarities but this one looks different, like coming from a rival group,” Diachenko tweeted. He told Threatpost via Twitter DM that the data sets were unique to this attack.

“Originally this data was exposed inside a misconfigured (thus publicly reachable) Elasticsearch cluster – most likely operated by the malicious actors themselves,” he said. “It contained entire logs of their operations, plus email/password pairs they used [for the attack].”

The data once again also was likely gleaned from prior breaches.

“I suppose that login pairs came from previously reported breaches or collections of data, so they just re-use them against Spotify accounts to become part of this automated process,” Diachenko said.

What Are the Dangers of Credential-Stuffing?

On the surface, a cybercriminal being able to log into someone’s Spotify account would seem to be more of a nuisance than anything else. Setting up rogue playlists, deleting saved songs or straight-up hijacking the ability to listen to music are some of the potential headaches.

However, there’s more to think about, Diachenko noted: For those who do reuse passwords, a validated Spotify log-in combo can simply be used to infiltrate other, higher-value accounts.

“Technically, it is not that dangerous if somebody breaks into your Spotify account (apart from moral part of course),” he said. “However, the worst-case scenario is that your details would be traded underground or even publicly (I know there are many eBay resellers to do that).”

Compromised accounts could contain credit-card information, loyalty points that could be stolen or used, or physical shipping addresses. And, accounts can also contain information like birthdays, preferences (those Spotify playlists, for example) and other data that is ripe for abuse when it comes to developing social-engineering tricks for phishing attacks.

To protect themselves from credential-stuffing attacks, users should enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts and avoid using passwords more than once.

The two French hospitals were stricken with ransomware attacks, and a third pre-emptively cut connections with an IT provider, in less than a week, prompting the transfer of some patients to other facilities.

The Villefranche-sur-Saône hospital complex in France’s eastern Rhone département (administrative area) announced Monday that a cyber attack had been detected at 4:30am local time.

The attack by the crypto-virus RYUK, a kind of ransomware, ""strongly impacts"" the Villefranche, Tarare and Trévoux sites of the North-West Hospital, the hospital said in a statement.

Ransomware is software that blocks data on a computer system that is then made accessible after a ransom payment.

Each hospital site’s team immediately set up limited procedures to ensure the exchange of information necessary for patient care, as well as a crisis unit to organise the operation of all three sites.

There are no scheduled transfers for patients in intensive care at Villefranche, nor for infants in the neonatal department, and Covid-19 vaccinations are continuing.

However, Tuesday’s slate of surgeries were postponed, and two sites are coordinating with the regional health agency to refer emergency patients to other facilities.

France’s National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) is helping to investigate the attack. The North-West Hospital’s statement came on the same day that ANSSI said it had discovered a hack of several organisations that bore the hallmarks of a group linked to Russian intelligence.

""This campaign mostly affected information technology providers, especially web hosting providers,"" ANSSI said in a report.

‘No ransom will be paid’

Monday’s attack in Villefranche follows similar ones on hospitals in Paris, Rouen, Montpellier, Issoudun, Albertville Moutiers, Toulon, and Narbonne during the past year – and just four days after the Dax hospital in the southwest Landes département reported a ransomware attack that took place on February 9.

>> French hospitals hit by ransomware attacks

The Dax hospital’s IT team was still in the “diagnostic stage” of responding to the attack, a staff member in the hospital’s communications office said Tuesday to FRANCE 24.

“It’s advancing,” she said.

France’s health ministry had confirmed to AFP that last week’s attack “paralysed … almost all information systems” at the hospital.

The attack had interrupted radiotherapy due to inoperable computers, said Benjamin Blanc, president of the hospital’s medical commission, at a press conference on February 11. Radiology, the laboratory and the pharmacy were operating at reduced levels but “without any consequences for patients”, while Covid-19 patient care and virus vaccinations were ongoing, Blanc said.

The Dax cyber attack also affected automated washing cycles and room catering.

Benôit Elleboode, director general of the regional health agency, called the attack an act of “despicable barbarity” at the press conference.

“No ransom will be paid since it doesn’t guarantee recovery of the codes to recover the data,” Elleboode said. “It would only tempt the pirates to target other hospitals.”

A near-miss at third hospital

An official at the hospital group in the Dordogne département, northwest of Landès, acted fast after an IT supplier reported finding a type of data encryption and file-locking malware in its own servers, according to France 3.

“We immediately cut off the networks going to this supplier and noticed that four computers at the hospital centre in Périgueux and two in Lanmary had already been contaminated,” Hugues Alegria, the director of computer systems, told the channel on February 11, the same date officials in Dax discussed the attack at their facility.

""In view of what happened at the Dax hospital, we immediately deactivated the backup servers to protect our back-up data,” Alegria said.

The Paris public prosecutor's office, which has national jurisdiction over cyber crime, is investigating the attack on the Dax hospital.

A December 2020 ANSSI report said that French healthcare facilities have not been an enhanced target during the pandemic, but also noted “a usual leveraging by cyber criminals of the ongoing pandemic” as well as “the ongoing trend of professionalisation of this type of actor”.

“Whether they take money from a hospital or from an accountant’s office, it makes no difference to them,” said Jérôme Noton, the head of France’s cyber surveillance program, to France Télévision.

CNA website outage

Sources have told BleepingComputer that the company suffered a cyberattack that has disrupted business operations and forced them to shut down specific systems.

BleepingComputer has not been able to verify if the outage is caused by a ransomware attack, though it appears likely according to a source familiar with the attack.

Other sources have told The Insurer that the attack is disrupting the underwriting and claims side of the business, likely due to systems becoming unavailable.

In an updated statement on their website, CNA has confirmed that a cyberattack is causing network disruption, including corporate email. To be safe, CNA also confirmed that they disconnected their systems from the network.

The full statement from CNA can be read below.

""On March 21, 2021, CNA determined that it sustained a sophisticated cybersecurity attack. The attack caused a network disruption and impacted certain CNA systems, including corporate email.



Upon learning of the incident, we immediately engaged a team of third-party forensic experts to investigate and determine the full scope of this incident, which is ongoing. We have alerted law enforcement and will be cooperating with them as they conduct their own investigation.

Should we determine that this incident impacted our insureds’ or policyholders’ data, we’ll notify those parties directly."" - CNA.

A treasure trove of data

Attacks on insurance carriers are particularly dangerous as they could allow a ransomware operation to create a list of future targets covered under a cyber insurance policy.

Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon for insurance companies to pay the insured victims' ransom.

Due to this, the REvil ransomware operation stated in a recent interview that insurers are valuable targets to create lists of potential targets who are more likely to pay a ransom.

""Yes, this is one of the tastiest morsels. Especially to hack the insurers first—to get their customer base and work in a targeted way from there. And after you go through the list, then hit the insurer themselves,"" REvil's 'Unknown' told the TheRecord.

While this attack has not been confirmed to be a ransomware attack, if it is, the threat actors likely stole business data before encrypting devices.

A cyberattack is an attempt by cybercriminals, hackers or other digital adversaries to access a computer network or system, usually for the purpose of altering, stealing, destroying or exposing information.

Cyberattacks can target a wide range of victims from individual users to enterprises or even governments. When targeting businesses or other organizations, the hacker’s goal is usually to access sensitive and valuable company resources, such as intellectual property (IP), customer data or payment details.

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, increasing the need for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and tooling. The shift to the cloud, as well as the explosion of connected devices, are two driving factors behind the need for organizations to modernize and strengthen their digital security capabilities.

Four Common Types of Cyberattacks

Cybersecurity threats can come in many forms. Here we explore four common types of cyberattacks: malware, ransomware, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).

Malware

Malware — or malicious software — is any program or code that is created with the intent to do harm to a computer, network or server.

In malware attacks, hackers can employ phishing techniques or exploit network vulnerabilities to access the system. Most malware applications start by ensuring a means of persistent access, allowing the adversary to slip into the network at will. Once inside, the malware takes control of the system with the intention of transmitting sensitive information such as customer data, IP or images from a device’s camera back to the malware owner.

Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware that denies legitimate users access to their system and requires a payment, or ransom, to regain access. A ransomware attack is designed to exploit system vulnerabilities and access the network. Once a system is infected, ransomware allows hackers to either block access to the hard drive or encrypt files on the computer.

In ransomware attacks, adversaries usually demand payment through untraceable cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, in many ransomware attack cases, the user is not able to regain access, even after the ransom is paid.

Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses email, SMS, phone or social media to entice a victim to share sensitive information — such as passwords or account numbers — or to download a malicious file that will install viruses on their computer or phone.

Major brands and government agencies often fall victim to being impersonated by phishing attackers in order to increase the success rate of retrieving information.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MITM)

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyberattack in which a malicious actor eavesdrops on a conversation between a network user and a web application. The goal of a MITM attack is to surreptitiously collect information, such as personal data, passwords or banking details, and/or to impersonate one party to solicit additional information or spur action. These actions can include changing login credentials, completing a transaction or initiating a transfer of funds.

While MITM attackers often target individuals, it is a significant concern for businesses and large organizations as well. One common point of access for hackers is through software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Attackers can use these applications as an entryway to the organization’s wider network and potentially compromise any number of assets, including customer data, IP or proprietary information about the organization and its employees.

Other Types of Cyberattacks

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious, targeted attack that floods a network with false requests in order to disrupt business operations. In a DoS attack, users are unable to perform routine and necessary tasks, such as accessing email, websites, online accounts or other resources that are operated by a compromised computer or network. While most DoS attacks do not result in lost data and are typically resolved without paying a ransom, they cost the organization time, money and other resources in order to restore critical business operations.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack in which an adversary inserts malicious code within a legitimate website. The code then launches as an infected script in the user’s web browser, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information or impersonate the user. Web forums, message boards, blogs and other websites that allow users to post their own content are the most susceptible to XSS attacks.

SQL Injection

SQL Injection attacks are similar to XSS in that adversaries leverage system vulnerabilities to inject malicious SQL statements into a data-driven application, which then allows the hacker to extract information from a database. Hackers use SQL Injection techniques to alter, steal or erase data.

Zero Day Attacks

A zero-day exploit is a security vulnerability or software flaw that a threat actor can target with malicious code before the software developer releases a patch.

Cyberattack Trends

The CrowdStrike Global Threat Report, an annual report detailing unique insights about the global threat landscape and best practices for organizations looking to amplify their cybersecurity maturity, identified several emerging trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Key findings from the 2021 Global Threat Report include:

Proliferation of supply chain attacks, ransomware, data extortion and nation-state threats.

An uptick in ransomware and big game hunting techniques, particularly in the healthcare industry as driven by nation-state adversaries seeking to steal valuable data seeking COVID-19 vaccine research.

Unprecedented growth in eCrime, with nearly four out of five interactive intrusions uncovered in 2020 being driven by eCrime actors.

Increased use of data extortion techniques accelerated by the introduction of Dedicated Leak Sites (DLS).

Who Is Responsible for Cyberattacks?

The 2021 Global Threat Report also highlights some of the most prolific and advanced cyber threat actors around the world. These include nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist adversaries. Our latest report identifies the following organizations as among the most advanced and dangerous cybercriminals.

Most Dangerous Cyberattacks to Date: Actor Spotlights

Wizard Spider

A big game hunter actor and established eCrime “megacorp,” Wizard Spider was the most reported criminal adversary in 2020. Activity from this adversary started off slow and sporadic but progressively ramped up operations through the remainder of the year. This criminal group is one of the most formidable adversaries thanks to its diverse toolset.

Wicked Panda

Wicked Panda, a suspected China-based adversary, continues to be one of the most prolific adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. The adversary began 2020 by conducting a wide-ranging campaign focused on exploiting multiple vulnerabilities.

Labyrinth Chollima

Labyrinth Chollima is a targeted intrusion adversary with a likely nexus to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). It was one of the most prolific and most active targeted-intrusion DPRK adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence.

Nation-State Actors

The CrowdStrike Intelligence team also tracks the activities of nation-states. Below are the nation-state actors identified in the 2021 Global Threat Report as posing the biggest risk to digital security:

Chinese Threat Adversaries

Chinese threat actors have been observed targeting technology, energy and healthcare sectors. During the past year, CrowdStrike has identified an uptick in China-based adversaries, due in part to the souring U.S.-Sino relations.

Iranian Threat Adversaries

Iranian hackers have boosted their efforts through the adoption of new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) this year. These new TTPs include things such as strategic web compromise (SWC) campaigns and mobile malware, and have been used to target regional rivals, contain dissident activity and expand their “soft war” campaigns.

North Korean Adversaries

Despite diplomatic overtures, DPRK-based adversaries appear to have increased their activity this year. Among their goals, the financial sector and inter-Korea related intelligence stand out as priorities among DPRK actors.

Russian Threat Adversaries

Russian hackers continue to be among the most active and destructive among nation-state adversaries. Top targets include the Ukrainian government, law enforcement and military entities.

Protecting the Organization from Advanced Cyber Threats

A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is absolutely essential in today’s connected world. From a business perspective, securing the organization’s digital assets has the obvious benefit of a reduced risk of loss, theft or destruction, as well as the potential need to pay a ransom to regain control of company data or systems. In preventing or quickly remediating cyberattacks, the organization also minimizes the impact of such events on business operations. Finally, when an organization takes steps to deter adversaries, they are essentially protecting the brand from the reputational harm that is often associated with cyber events — especially those that involve the loss of customer data."

Molson Coors has hired forensic information technology firms and legal counsel to assist the incident investigation. The beverage company did not disclose the names of cybersecurity company or MSSPs (managed security services providers) involved in the investigation.

Some media reports suggest Molson Coors suffered a ransomware attack. But the beverage company did not use that term in its description of the incident.

Molson Coors Cyberattack Details: SEC Filing Statement

An SEC filing about the cybersecurity incident stated:

“On March 11, 2021, Molson Coors Beverage Company (the “Company”) announced that it experienced a systems outage that was caused by a cybersecurity incident. The Company has engaged leading forensic information technology firms and legal counsel to assist the Company’s investigation into the incident and the Company is working around the clock to get its systems back up as quickly as possible. Although the Company is actively managing this cybersecurity incident, it has caused and may continue to cause a delay or disruption to parts of the Company’s business, including its brewery operations, production, and shipments. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, one should carefully consider the discussion on the risks and uncertainties that cybersecurity incidents and operational disruptions to key facilities may have on the Company, its business and financial results contained in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in its 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2021.”

Still, the incident is not mentioned on the Molson Coors investor website nor is it mentioned in the Molson Coors news site (as of March 15, 2021).

Molson Coors Financial Performance

Molson Coors’ business was under pressure even before the cyberattack. Indeed, fourth quarter 2020 net sales revenue decreased 7.7 percent, “primarily driven by Europe and Canada declines resulting from restrictions in the on-premise channel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.” In other words: When bars are closed, beer-related revenues suffer.

Molson Coors annual revenue was $9.65 billion in 2020, down from $10.58 billion in 2019.

Molson Coors promised a prompt resolution to the crippling cyber attack that left the company unable to access various systems involved in the production and delivery of popular drinks.

Molson Coors enrolls IT forensic firms, warns of potential delays after a cyber attack

While acknowledging the disruption, Molson Coors disclosed that it had enrolled leading forensic IT firms and legal teams to conduct an investigation into the incident.

The filing assured the authorities and the public that “the company is working around the clock to get its systems.” However, Molson Coors warned that the security incident could cause continued “delay or disruption to parts of the company’s business, including its brewery operations, production, and shipments.

Molson Coors cyber attack linked to suspected ransomware

While Molson Coors investigates the cyber attack, several sources suggested a possible ransomware attack. Speculations suggest that the fifth world’s largest beermaker took its systems offline to prevent the spread of ransomware across its network. However, no ransomware group has taken responsibility for the cyber attack or demanded a ransom.

“At the moment multiple reports indicate Molson Coors fell victim to a ransomware attack, but the precise family of ransomware hasn’t been specified,” Tony Lambert, intelligence analyst at Red Canary, gave credence to the speculation. “For manufacturing organizations, ransomware poses a major threat to data and system availability. Not only do corporate systems lose access to data, systems managing the manufacturing process may come to a halt as well, preventing the successful production and even delivery of products.”

Threat actors are likely to remain silent immediately after a cyber attack to increase the victim’s likelihood of cooperating.

The silence also earns them more leverage as many victims attempt to conceal the incident to avoid reputational damage associated with ransomware attacks.

After misleading the authorities and the public, organizations could suffer further reputational damages and possible legal consequences if they refused to pay the ransom.

Ransomware groups targeting beverage companies and industrial manufacturers

Ransomware operators have been diversifying their target victims to include companies not previously considered primary targets of ransomware. They have also been expanded their attack vectors including deploying ransomware through vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Servers.

According to the global data protection officer at OneLogin, Niamh Muldoon, “no industry is exempt from the ransomware threat.”

An Italian beverage manufacturer Campari Group was hit by a ransomware attack in November 2020, while Arizona Beverages’ computer systems were crippled by a ransomware attack two years ago.

On June 9, 2020, an Australian and New Zealand beer and milk supplier Lion was also disrupted by a similar ransomware attack. The attack delayed increased production schedules planned during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of the manufacturing behemoths struck by ransomware attacks in the past include Groupe Beneteau, a French boatmaker. The Japanese automaker Honda suffered a similar ransomware attack at U.S. facilities last summer, disrupting production operations. WestRock packaging also suffered a ransomware attack that heavily affected its operations.

Ransomware attacks on manufacturing firms could be devastating because a slight disruption in production could be catastrophic to other businesses down the supply chain.

Similarly, they pose an existential threat to the affected company because they could lead to colossal financial losses through reduced production, lost data, reputational damage, and costly ransom payouts.

Thus, SEC filings help potential investors to assess the risk associated with the affected companies before committing their finances. It’s no surprise that many companies are uncomfortable in acknowledging ransomware attacks.

“This is an example of how attackers are targeting high profile organizations to interrupt key business operations, in this case, manufacturing,” says Ms. Muldoon. “Ransomware remains a global cybersecurity threat and is the one cybercrime that has a high direct return of investment associated with it, by holding the victims’ ransom for financial payment.”

According to Edgard Capdevielle, CEO at Nozomi Networks, “high profile attacks are becoming all too common, as attackers have realized they are immensely more profitable when they target large organizations and disrupt their critical business operations – in this case, the brewing operations of the world’s biggest, well-known beer brands.”

He says that the potential ransomware incident should be factored into the business incidence response and continuity plans.

“Beyond a technical response, decision-makers need to be prepared to weigh the risks and consequences of alternate actions,” Capdevielle adds. “Ransomware threat actors typically rely on spear-phishing links or vulnerable public services to gain initial entry into a network. Afterward, they move laterally to gain access to as many nodes of the network as possible, allowing them to increase the magnitude of the disruption.”

A hospital in southwest France has seen some of its IT systems paralysed by a ""ransomware"" cyberattack, its management said Tuesday, the third such incident in the last month.

The 320-bed facility in Oloron-Sainte-Marie near the Pyrenees mountains was hit by the attack on Monday, with screens displaying a demand in English for $50,000 in Bitcoin.

Hospital workers have had to revert to working with pens and paper, since digital patient records are not available.

The management system, used to monitor medicine stocks and other supplies, has also been affected at a time when the hospital is taking part in vaccination efforts against COVID-19.

""We might get our systems back in 48 hours or in three months,"" hospital director Frederic Lecenne told local newspaper La Republique des Pyrenees.

He said personnel had disconnected some computers from the internet and the hospital's network to try to limit the spread of the ransomware.

In February, hospitals in Dax in southwest France and in Villefranche-sur-Saône in the southeastern Rhone region were subjected to ransomware attacks, while in 2019 a hospital in northern Rouen was also hit.

In the case of cyberattacks, many companies have vulnerabilities in their defenses and reactions they haven’t prepared for that hackers will test. Many organizations can benefit from instituting fire drills and tabletop exercises, which test a company’s response plan at every level. These exercises will almost certainly reveal gaps in security, response plans, and employees’ familiarity with their own roles. While investing in external facilitators for these exercises will often allow for a more rigorous test separate from internal dynamics, there is guidance for organizations who wish to execute internal exercises to better prepare for a cyberattack.

Cyberattacks always happen when you least expect them. And when they happen, they happen quickly. Responding appropriately is not just the responsibility of your cybersecurity team; everyone in the organization has a role to play. Is your team prepared? Do they know what to do and what not to do? Most importantly, has your whole team practiced their response? Everyone — the board of directors, company executives, managers, and team members — has to know their roles and responsibilities and work out any potential problems with their response before a live cyberattack puts immense stress on the organization.

There’s an easy way to determine whether your incident response plan (IRP) works and whether your team knows their roles: a test. Yet a Ponemon survey determined that 47% of organizations have not assessed the readiness of their incident response teams, meaning that the first time they test their plans will be at the worst possible time — in the middle of a cyberattack. Hackers constantly and consistently test your defenses and reactions. You must do the same.

In our work helping organizations — both public and private, large and small, domestic and international — plan for cyberattacks, we’ve found that fire drills and table top exercises (TTXs) are a great way to prepare for the worst.

Fire Drills and Table Top Exercises

Think of an emergency room scenario following a car accident. When seriously injured patients arrive, the ER staff has to know exactly what to do and how to do it. They cannot be learning at the same time the crisis is happening. The same goes for C-suite executives and top management. To make sure they are aligned and aware of company plans during a cyberattack, they need to practice ahead of time and build muscle memory in how to respond. Simulated scenarios help organizations to validate their plans and prepare company leaders.

An effective engagement takes a few weeks of planning, and works best when realistic situations and scenarios are used. We usually create videos simulating the company being criticized on the evening news, have journalists show up and demand to interview the CEO, or interrupt a press conference to ask about the cyberattack. We have simulated dark websites where executives can see their most valuable intellectual property being auctioned to the highest bidder, and their stock price dropping like a rock.

The first step is to make sure there are clear learning objectives and to determine which cyberattack consequences will have a serious negative impact to the organization. Fire drills and TTXs help organizations identify vulnerabilities and risks that need to be addressed, demonstrate to the organization the magnitude of the risk and the importance of security resources and investment, and test plans in a way that helps everyone be ready. It’s almost a certainty that something unanticipated will occur. Knowing what to do helps executives respond when the unexpected actually happens.

Each test serves a different purpose. TTXs are occasional and test managerial capability and team-level response; fire drills are regular exercises that test people, processes, and technologies to make sure they respond appropriately and that there are contingency plans in place in the event that first-line responses don’t work. If the digital systems that support the organization are compromised, it is critical to have alternative communication plans, operational plans, back ups, and emergency resources identified that can back-fill until normal processes and systems can be restored. Without these tests, companies are left vulnerable to whatever might be thought of in the moment when their main systems are compromised, and that can result in major business disruption such as was experienced recently by Santander Bank, the City of Baltimore, and just recently, the U.S. Treasury.

The 4 Most Effective Fire Drills and TTXs So where should you start? It depends on who and what you want to test. We have found four types of fire drills and table top exercises to be the most effective. Target audience Type and objective of exercise Motivation Approximate length of exercise Board of directors TTX: education and awareness Boards need to know what the company will do in the event of a cyber emergency. 1–2 hours C-suite TTX: crisis management C-level executives need to have plans for crisis management so that they know immediately what to do and whom to contact. 2–4 hours Organization Fire drill: test and practice incident response and business continuity plans Detailed drills build organizational confidence and strength to respond quickly and effectively throughout the company. Especially useful for the cybercrisis management team. A few hours to multiple days Technical team Fire drill: technical response planning Testing on a regular basis ensures that detection systems, technology backups, and contingency plans are in place and working and that the tech team knows what to do and how to do it. Continuous, with a full fire drill at least quarterly © HBR.org

Each approach listed above tests a different part of a company’s plans. A TTX for your C-level team will help them practice the current company response plan and test alternative contingencies should the unexpected happen. A TTX for your board provides a similar opportunity. Ultimately TTXs and fire drills drive awareness and build values, attitudes, and beliefs around the importance of everyone participating in keeping the organization secure. Importantly, each test helps companies find out what about their plan isn’t going to work — and gives them time to fix it before they need to put it into action.

What Your Organization Will Likely Discover

A good TTX immerses participants in a cyberattack so they can feel the effects of the decisions they make and the effectiveness of the company plans. Most organizations discover something about their plans that previously had not been obvious, such as:

Flawed and unmanageable plans:

One manufacturing company realized their incident response plan was 400 pages long and no one had ever read it. When your shareholders and the press are clogging your switchboard asking for information, your employees are not sure what to do, and the cybercriminal is exfiltrating gigabytes of data or encrypting your computers so the employees cannot work, that is not the time for each executive to read a 400 page document — of which only 5-6 pages may apply to them — to determine what actions to take.

Knowing who to call:

In another exercise, the first line solution to the crisis was that “someone will call Pat who will handle that by checking this software.” However, only one person knew Pat, Pat didn’t know it was their responsibility, and the software didn’t really work as the person assumed. It’s this level of detail that maximizes the value of the exercise.

New unanticipated risks:

At other times, these tests can make companies aware of risks they had never considered — let alone planned for. In 2018, we conducted several TTXs where the scenario included several physical locations of an organization being uninhabitable, and the organization had to move to an all-work-from-home scenario. We unwittingly prepared these organizations for the reality of the current Covid-19 situation (though some at the time didn’t believe there was a situation in which this could occur).

Impacts beyond business continuity:

A TTX is a useful tool to highlight impacts beyond business continuity. In a very large financial institution, we created an exercise with a scenario that caused customers to lose confidence in doing business with the organization. One of the C-suite executives stopped the exercise in the middle and responded, “You realize that he [the TTX facilitator pretending to be a cyber criminal] just destroyed our company with one plausible scenario! We need to invest more in cybersecurity.”

Motivation to invest in cybersecurity:

In a recent study by Osterman Research, 45% of respondents said that following a TTX, they were able to increase their security budgets. Most of this budget was spent on procuring additional solutions and training their workforce. This same study highlighted that 78% of cybersecurity professionals believed that their TTXs and fire drills had better prepared their organizations to respond to future cyber threats.

What Should Your Organization Do Next?

Using an external source to create and conduct a fire drill or TTX can increase the benefits. Internally designed exercises often lack the level of surprise and unexpected scenarios and interventions. After creating the response plans, internal team members have a difficult time envisioning something unexpected. Further, team members may have difficulty challenging their peers and senior executives, resulting in groupthink or letting the team off the hook rather than challenging their responses and ideas. External leaders don’t have the same assumptions and don’t come to the table with the organization’s institutional memory and habits. Pressing for details and discovering flaws in plans can be career limiting for an insider, but it’s expected and necessary for an effective exercise.

That said, while there are benefits to bringing in outsiders (and we’d argue that it’s worth the cost), companies can organize these tests on their own. Here are a few best practices for creating and conducting your own exercises:

Get the right people in the room. Schedule sessions far in advance and let the executives know they are mandatory. Getting everyone in the same room or Zoom call for the same 2-4 hours can be challenging. Build a likely scenario timeline for your organization and share information carefully. Pick a cyberattack that seems plausible for your type of organization, since an exercise close to a real situation your team might encounter will be more engaging. Decide if the cyberattack will take place over hours, days, or weeks, and make sure you communicate how you may be speeding time up during the exercise. Real attacks happen over time, so the unfolding of events is important to the exercise. At each point on the timeline, the participants must make the best decision they can with the information they have. Do not give the participants all the information they would like to have at any given time. This helps them to realize what they need to know in a real incident. Create the scenario so every member of the team has a role to play. It’s very easy to tell someone else what they should do, but sometimes it’s hard to hear or think up what you should do. Response plans often have activities for specific roles (what the CEO should do, what the CIO should do, what the CHRO role should do, etc.). If possible, share the full organizational response plan with the team ahead of time so they know it exists (and hopefully they read it). Create an abbreviated version, customized for each participant, that contains only that participant’s roles and responsibilities to help them be as prepared as possible. Discuss action plans at each pause of the timeline. After telling the participants a piece of the scenario, give them a chance to discuss what they would suggest doing. Ask them if what they are doing conforms to the company incident response plan or if they are improvising. If they are improvising — is it because the plan is not satisfactory and should be improved? Be sure to have someone taking notes so ideas from these discussions are not lost. Practice before the full team exercise. The best exercises have been well thought out and test the organization’s current response plans and improvisions. Prepare for this by running a short practice TTX one-on-one with each executive in the privacy of their office or a private call. Walk them through their role as described in the current response plan. This will avoid a situation where an executive does not participate in the group exercise because they are afraid to embarrass themselves. While this can be a powerful force for change, it often backfires and results in finger-pointing, leaving the room, or other emotionally-charged behavior.

Companies who conduct fire drills and table top exercises report that they are both better prepared for a cyber crisis and more cohesive as a team in the face of an emergency. The cost benefit of TTX can be realized quickly — and the result is an increase in the agility and quality of a response which could reduce the financial impact to an organization by millions. It’s time to schedule your team’s practice sessions.
