Potentially compromised information could include limited health and clinical data, research data and the personally identifiable information of CU Boulder and CU Denver students, prospective students and employees.
Most of the compromised data was from the Boulder campus and some was from the Denver campus, Kennedy said.
CU Anschutz, CU Colorado Springs, the system administration and the CU Foundation do not appear to be impacted.
“I understand this notice raises many questions and we are committed to providing information as we get it,” Kennedy wrote.","data, students, personal, employees, cyberattack, wrote, compromised, service, university, cu, kennedy, files, information"

“From a software engineering perspective, it’s probably fair to say that this is the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen,” Microsoft President Brad Smith told U.S. broadcaster CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program on Sunday.
Smith said “certainly more than a thousand” engineers must have worked on creating and exploiting the vulnerability in the SolarWinds software.
The hack exploited business software firm SolarWinds' Orion product to send malware to about 18,000 public and private organizations, in what is known as a ""supply chain"" cyberattack.
Microsoft previously singled out Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom as European countries home to victims of the attack.","largest, software, cyberattack, president, victims, compromised, attack, organizations, sophisticated, solarwinds, microsoft"

And the answer we came to was, well, certainly more than 1,000,"" Smith said, speaking with the program 60 Minutes.
Cybersecurity experts have said it could take months to identify all the compromised systems and expel the hackers.
Microsoft announced in late December that it was among the thousands of companies that found its systems compromised.
The compromised software provided hackers a backdoor into government and company networks.","hackers, speaking, smith, software, president, cyberattack, united, compromised, systems, sophisticated, blamed, services, russian, company, microsoft"

More alarming: how the hackers got in… piggy-backing on a piece of third party software used to connect, manage and monitor computer networks.
FireEye's core mission is to hunt, find, and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks of their clients - mostly governments and major companies.
But FireEye used SolarWinds software, which turned the cyber hunter into the prey.

The hacker group Sandworm has been linked to GRU by cybersecurity authorities and experts.
European diplomats imposed sanctions on several officers of Russia's intelligence unit linked to Sandworm in relation to the cyberattacks.
U.S. authorities also indicted hackers belonging to the same group and said the group was suspected of being behind the 2017 cyberattack on then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s party La République En Marche.
The public mention of Sandworm by French authorities is rare, since the country has traditionally been hesitant to attribute cyberattacks.","hackers, cyberattacks, large, french, software, agency, cybersecurity, cyberattack, sandworm, linked, breached, france, identifies, group, russialinked, intrusion"
5,2021-02-16 11:00:20+00:00,North Korea 'launched cyber-attack on Pfizer for COVID-19 jab data' -,https://pharmaphorum.com/news/north-korea-launched-cyber-attack-on-pfizer-for-covid-19-jab-data/,"A news agency is claiming that North Korea launched a cyber-attack on Pfizer in a bid to steal information about its BioNTech-partnered COVID-19 vaccine, citing South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS).
The Yonhap agency said the revelation was made during a closed-door meeting of the intelligence committee of South Korea’s National Assembly.
With the race for COVID-19 vaccines now in high gear, and drugmakers under increased pressure to develop jabs and supply them in high quantities, the vulnerabilities are becoming more acute.
North Korea is reported to be in line to receive nearly two million doses of the AZ COVID-19 vaccine in the first half of this year through the international COVAX vaccine distribution programme.
And last year, Europol warned that criminal networks were exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic with a surge in cybercrime.","hackers, data, services, national, vaccine, agency, intelligence, cyberattack, pharma, north, korea, jab, launched, covid19, pfizer, vaccines, information"

“One is I don’t think this is the only water treatment facility that’s set up in this manner, and I don’t think it’s the only critical infrastructure that’s set up in this manner.”Watkins said that this was likely a target of opportunity, meaning that someone was scanning the Internet, found TeamViewer, breached it and stumbled onto access to the treatment facility.
While there, they began adding sodium hydroxide.
""TeamViewer is aware of media reports regarding an unauthorized remote access to the Oldsmar water treatment facility and we are monitoring the situation very closely,” Gus Serino, principal industrial control systems analyst for Dragos Inc., wrote in a statement to theNow that attackers know that they can penetrate this type of system easily, they may start attacking more frequently and, perhaps, other critical infrastructure.“It does not have the greatest security baked into it, especially on the consumer side, and I would venture that it was probably the consumer version,” Watkins said.
So when I say this is probably a residential version of the software they installed,” Watkins explained, “it’s likely they don’t have the funding for security to install an enterprise-grade remote software system.”","treatment, remote, software, thats, facility, cyberattack, watkins, critical, come, think, teamviewer, suggests, water"

Replay: A Second Credential-Stuffing Attack for SpotifyBack in November, cybercriminals attacked hundreds of thousands of Spotify users utilizing this approach, prompting the streaming music service to issue password-reset notices.
This second attack is very similar, with the log-in data also exposed in a public Elasticsearch instance.
On the surface, a cybercriminal being able to log into someone’s Spotify account would seem to be more of a nuisance than anything else.
“Technically, it is not that dangerous if somebody breaks into your Spotify account (apart from moral part of course),” he said.","data, users, cyberattack, login, spotify, accounts, second, account, music, diachenko, credentialstuffing, passwords, suffers"
