Tropical Cyclone Eloise has made landfall near Mozambique‚Äôs port city of Beira, which was devastated by Cyclone Idai less than two years ago.

‚ÄúBeira had mild damage, but is too early to quantify the extent and scale of destruction,‚Äù Luisa Meque, president of Mozambique‚Äôs National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGD), said in a television interview with national broadcaster TVM on Saturday.

The South African weather department said Eloise made landfall around 2:30am, with wind speeds of 160 kilometres (99 miles) per hour. The cyclone has since lost its strength and has been downgraded to a tropical storm, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Cars were submerged in water, walls of some low-lying buildings collapsed and swaths of land were flooded in Beira, posts on Twitter showed.

Beira was the epicentre of damage from Idai in March 2019, which ravaged the country‚Äôs second biggest city and killed more than 1,000 people across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

Al Jazeera‚Äôs Fahmida Miller, reporting from Johannesburg, said the area affected is one where ‚Äúpeople live in informal settlements, homes made from plastic sheeting [and] corrugated iron‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt appears that hundreds of these homes have been destroyed by the cyclone, and those people are still looking for shelter in places like schools,‚Äù Miller said.

She added that there is concern as flooding is expected to continue over the next 72 hours, adding that areas outside of Beira have also been heavily affected.

‚ÄúAid agencies can‚Äôt get out ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a lot of concern around the capacity of the aid agencies as well as the government to help people.‚Äù





Mozambique National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) said Sofala province, which includes Beira, had seen 200mm (8 inches) of rainfall and was likely to see another 100mm of rain over the next 24 hours.

Power supplies were shut down as the cyclone damaged power lines and uprooted some electricity poles, power utility EDM said, local digital news media A Carta reported.

‚ÄúThe cyclone is still in the territory of Mozambique and should make an exit at 8pm today,‚Äù Gorkhmaz Huseynov, head of the Mozambique delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross, told Reuters news agency.

WMO late on Friday had upgraded the storm, fuelled by the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique channel, to a tropical cyclone with strength equivalent to a category two storm. Category two strength ‚Äì on a five-level scale ‚Äì refers to hurricanes with maximum wind speeds of 154-177 kph.

‚ÄúBy tomorrow, it will be an overland tropical depression. At that time the speed will be 60kph,‚Äù Mbazhi Maliage, a forecaster at the South African Weather Service, told Reuters.

The weather department said on its official Twitter handle that more than 200mm of rainfall was expected from Saturday night to Monday in some parts of South Africa‚Äôs Mpumalanga and Kwa-Zulu Natal provinces and in the southern African kingdom of eSwatini.

Ahead of the cyclone‚Äôs arrival, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned that at least 100,000 people will be affected.

‚ÄúHeavy rainfall will persist for over 24 hours,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThe amount of rain will be sufficient to flood low areas of Beira and Buzi. Further flooding may arrive some days later as accumulated water flows down the Pungue and Buzi rivers from Zimbabwe.‚Äù"

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working closely with the Government of Mozambique, the United Nations, and the humanitarian partners and clusters to ensure coordination in the response. The assessments began immediately following Cyclone Eloise‚Äôs arrival to determine the communities‚Äô most pressing needs.

According to the National Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction (INGD), more than 175,000 people have been affected by the cyclone in Mozambique, and over 8,000 houses have been destroyed, damaged, or flooded. Thus far, six people are confirmed dead since Eloise made landfall on Saturday.

Three days later, a total of 32 accommodation centres have been activated in Sofala province to provide temporary shelter for over 15,000 men, women and children.

According to an assessment by the IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) and Mozambique‚Äôs INGD, needs at these accommodation centres include food, tents, potable water, hygiene kits, COVID-19 prevention materials, mosquito nets, blankets, flashlights, tarps, health kits, and soap.

According to relief workers on the scene, individuals have received food and water from provincial authorities and the INGD.

‚ÄúIOM is carrying out monitoring of accommodation centres in order to refer cases to health facilities, but unfortunately many health facilities are damaged due to the cyclone,‚Äù explained Angelica Sitoe, IOM Health Team Leader in Beira. ‚ÄúWe are very concerned for chronic disease patients who lost their medication in the cyclone.‚Äù

Families are living in close quarters in accommodation centres. ‚ÄúMany reported having lost face masks. Many do not have adequate personal hygiene facilities, which creates concern for COVID-19 transmission. There are also many cases of malaria due to the rainy season,‚Äù IOM‚Äôs Sitoe added.

Schools, government facilities, and religious buildings are sheltering hundreds of displaced families, many of whom fled the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs. Many say they lost food supplies, farming tools and seeds, and that cropland is affected, which raises questions about food security.

Power outages continue across wide swathes of Beira and neighboring Buzi district.

IOM‚Äôs 160 staff in the area are working closely with the Government of Mozambique, United Nations- and other humanitarian partners to ensure a coordinated response. The assessments began the morning after the storm in order to determine the extent of displacement, damage and the needs of local communities.

DTM evaluations indicate that of the 70 resettlement centres where people displaced by Cyclone Idai in 2019 reside, located in areas affected by Cyclone Chalane, more than half have restricted access due to flooding.

IOM staff are distributing soap and a limited supply of cloth face masks to the most vulnerable in accommodation centres and providing further information about the need to maintain physical distancing, but say this is very difficult under the circumstances. Mobile teams are providing psychological first aid to affected population in accommodation centres and resettlement sites.

‚ÄúWaist deep water entered our home around 1:00 am; the roof panels blew off in the strong wind. I picked up my son and, holding my wife‚Äôs hand, we went to a neighbor‚Äôs house for refuge,‚Äù explained Domingos Veloso, a local rice farmer and mason in Mungassa Inharimue, a district of Beira City. ‚ÄúWe just wanted morning to come; at daybreak we moved to take shelter in the school. We are grateful to be alive. My wife and son are staying at an accommodation centre; I am staying here to protect our property.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI tried but I was not able to recover anything; our belongings all went with the water flowing through the house. My farming tools and seeds are gone.‚Äù

Many resettlement sites report destruction and damage to homes and structures, including health clinics and school facilities. Others cite a lack of sufficient latrines.

IOM‚Äôs joint monitoring and assessment, as well as the initial response in accommodation centres in cooperation with local authorities, are ongoing.

Myrta Kaulard, the UN‚Äôs resident coordinator in Mozambique, added on Tuesday that 18,000 people were internally displaced after Cyclone Eloise made landfall in the early hours of Saturday.

‚ÄúYesterday, we were mentioning 170,000 people affected. Today, the official figures have climbed to 250,000,‚Äù Kaulard said in a video call with reporters at the UN, adding that 76 health centres and hundreds of classrooms were damaged.

‚ÄúWe also see widespread floods that are still there and a lot of people trying still to get out of the flooded areas,‚Äù she said.





Eloise brought winds of up to 150 kilometres per hour (90 miles per hour) followed by torrential rain over the port city of Beira, the capital of Mozambique‚Äôs Sofala province, and the adjacent Buzi district.

It weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland to Zimbabwe, South Africa, eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland and Botswana.

The death toll across the region rose to 14 on Tuesday after South Africa reported one more death.

In Mozambique, the cyclone hit an area already devastated by two successive super-storms in March and April 2019.

The first, Cyclone Idai, left more than 1,000 dead and caused damage estimated at about $2bn.

An international aid group warned on Tuesday that crowded centres for storm survivors created ideal conditions for the coronavirus to spread.

In the port city of Beira alone, 8,700 people are living in 16 temporary shelters after their homes were destroyed by the cyclone.

SUVA, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) -- Tropical cyclone Ana, the first one that hit Fiji this year, has caused extensive damages to the South Pacific island nation.

According to a statement by Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) on Sunday, around 10:00 p.m. local time on Saturday night, the center of tropical cyclone Ana moved past the northern part of the Yasawa islands and headed towards Fiji's main island of Viti Levu before strengthening into a category 2 system.

At 6:00 a.m. local time on Sunday morning, the cyclone made landfall near Rakiraki in the northern part of Viti Levu and continued to track south-southeast over the central part of Fiji towards the capital area of Suva.

By midday on Sunday, the center of Ana was located over the coast of Viti Levu between Suva and Navua, a town about 38 km west of Suva heading towards Kadavu in the southern part of Fiji.

The FMS said very strong winds have been reported over Kadavu on Sunday morning and tropical cyclone Ana is expected to pass Kadavu on Sunday night.

Close to the center of the cyclone, destructive storm force winds with average speeds of 100 km per hour and momentary gusts of up to 140 km per hour will continue to be felt over most parts of Fiji, including the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, the second largest island in Fiji.

The FMS warned that winds of this strength and speed can cause significant damage to trees, weak structures and houses, heavy damage to crops and power failures.

According to local media reports, the tropical cyclone, which has brought heavy rain and strong winds, has caused extensive damages to the island nation while five people, including a 3-year-old boy, went missing.

The main rivers in the nation have surged, some villages in the low-lying areas have been flooded and some highways across the nation have been closed. Fallen trees, broken power lines and landslides were also reported in the nation.

In capital city of Suva, Xinhua correspondents found some big trees near Fiji's State House, the government building and the Port of Suva have fallen to the ground and rescue workers are busy removing them.

Currently, a total of 7,612 people are taking shelter in 204 evacuation center across the nation.

Fiji's Education Ministry has confirmed that all schools in Fiji will remain closed on Monday until further notice.

The FMS warned of more heavy rains and strong winds on Sunday and Monday. The Fijian authorities have urged people to continue to stay safe at home.

Last December, tropical cyclone Yasa hit Fiji, killing four people and causing extensive damage to houses and schools, especially in the northern part of the island nation.

Tropical Cyclone Kimi formed off the Far North Queensland coast on Sunday.

At 10:00pm on Sunday, the Bureau of Meteorology estimated the cyclone was 145 kilometres east-south-east of Cooktown and 155km north-north-east of Cairns.

It is currently a category one system but the bureau warned it may intensify over the next 24 hours and reach at least category two before landfall.

While earlier predictions had it tracking further north, the Bureau said the system had slowed, delaying the crossing time to Monday afternoon.

The cyclone is moving very slowly south at 7 kilometres per hour and it is expected to turn south-south-west towards the coast on Monday.

The bureau said it would likely to reach category two before making landfall.

As the cyclone approached, gusts of 130kph could be felt between Cape Flattery and Cairns.

Forecaster Kimba Wong said the cyclone warning zone stretched from Cape Melville to Cardwell and the adjacent inland, where gusts up to 120kph could be felt from Sunday evening.

""We may start to see destructive wind gusts,"" she said.

""Certainly a very dynamic system to keep across over the next couple of days.""

Ms Wong urged people in the region to make immediate preparations.

""Such as preparing boats and also your property for the approaching system.""

BOM warns that rivers could rise rapidly as the area is already saturated from rainfall in the last two weeks.

The region has been on flood watch for the past two days.

Heavy rain is expected from late Sunday and daily rainfall totals between 50 and 100 millimetres are expected.

Ms Wong said the storm would deliver a couple of days of ""wet and wild weather"", but was expected to weaken rapidly after crossing the coast."

Fiji‚Äôs second largest island, Vanua Levu, bore the brunt of the devastation. Uraia Rainima, commissioner of the Northern Division, which includes Vanua Levu, told the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) in late December that they had completed an initial damage assessment and found that as many as 1,500 homes were totally destroyed, while 6,000 more were partially damaged.

With hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crops estimated to have been destroyed, as well as subsistence farmers‚Äô personal food sources, the FBC reported that the government believes there is a need for a quick recovery plan to ensure the nutrition needs for people in the north are met.

The recovery plan has so far included distributing 10,000 seedlings and Bele cuttings and more than 150,000 cassava stems and deploying teams to effected communities.

Ranadi Rauluna, a Fijian woman from one of the areas worst hit, told the ABC that she had lived through at least 15 cyclones but had never experienced one as powerful as Cyclone Yasa.

The U.N. resident coordinator in Fiji, Sanaka Samarsinha, told RNZ that about 7,000 people remained in evacuation centers and that a large-scale response would be needed, one that would involve international help.

‚ÄúThese people were already quite vulnerable to begin with,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about poor farmers, informal laborers, their vulnerabilities are totally exposed. The people who have been affected have been affected very badly.‚Äù

New Zealand in late December announced that it had donated NZ$2 million (US$1.44 million) on top of an initial NZ$500,000 to Fiji, which went toward shelter, water sanitation, and other urgent priorities.

Australia has contributed AU$4.5 million (US$3.48 million) in humanitarian relief, which will go toward supplying building materials, medical supplies, hygiene kits, and education supplies. Around 600 Australian Defense Force members have also arrived in Fiji on the HMAS Adelaide navy ship, with helicopters and landing aircraft, to assist affected communities.

Fiji‚Äôs cyclone season runs between November and April every year and historically Fiji could expect to experience up to three tropical cyclones each season, but Fiji‚Äôs ambassador to the U.N., Satyendra Prasad, told The World that with climate change, the intensity will get even worse.

‚ÄúFor two of the worst storms to hit in the last five years alone ‚Äî that just can‚Äôt be normal. Never in our history have we seen the short space of time in which cyclones form, intensify, and become destructive,‚Äù he said.

Typhoon Krosa is at right. A study released on Thursday, Jan, 28, 2021, finds that tropical cyclones around the globe are getting closer to land than they used to, except for Atlantic hurricanes. (NASA/NOAA via AP)

Tropical cyclones across the globe, except Atlantic hurricanes, are moving closer to land in recent decades, a new study found.

Also called typhoons, tropical cyclones generally have been moving westward by about 18 miles per decade (30 kilometers) since 1982, putting them closer to land and making them more dangerous, a study in Thursday's journal Science said. Each decade since the 1980s, an additional two cyclones have come within 124 miles (200 kilometers) of land, the study said

Researchers don't quite know why this is happening, but it adds to other ominous trends in cyclone activity. Past studies have found that the most intense storms are getting stronger and storms in general are getting wetter, shifting poleward, moving slower and are keeping their power longer after hitting land.

But while the new study found storms are getting closer to land, researchers still haven't seen a significant increase in landfalls, which ""is still a puzzle,"" said study lead author Shuai Wang, a cyclone scientist at Imperial College in London.

""It's not only the landfall that causes damage. When the cyclone is close enough to land it can also cause damage like Hurricane Sandy and Dorian a few years ago,"" Wang said, who also mentioned 2019's Typhoon Lekima, one of the costliest in Chinese history. ""If you look at the track before the final landfall, those cyclones skirted along the U.S. coast for a long time and that certainly caused damage. That's one reason why we look at coastal activity.""

It's mysterious that, unlike other areas, the Atlantic hurricane basin didn't show any significant westward shift, but that could be because the Atlantic hurricane zone is more closely surrounded by continents, Wang said. The busiest tropical cyclone basin is in the western Pacific, where there are the most landfalls and the shift westward is twice as big as the global average.

Wang and his colleagues are still trying to figure out why this westward shift is happening. Storms generally move east to west because of trade winds in the tropics, so a greater westward shift usually puts them closer to where the land is, Wang said. Storms that form just west of land, such as in the Pacific off the California and Mexican coasts, are usually moving away from land already, so this shift doesn't spare more land.

Changes in atmospheric currents that steer storms tend to be pushing cyclones farther west, but why is still an open question, Wang said. He said it could be only partly explained by some natural long-term climate cycles.

Other shifts in atmospheric patterns have been connected to human-caused climate change and that's a possible factor in the shift but not something researchers can prove yet, he said.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel said the study is plausible, especially since scientists have already seen a shift of storms more toward the north and south poles, but it raises questions that require follow up, especially why no corresponding increase in landfalls has been found.

All these strange shifts are taking cyclones out of their preferred environment of warm tropical waters away from land, University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.

TC Imogen has since been downgraded to a tropical low after crossing land just north of Karumba in the Gulf of Carpentaria about 9:00pm Sunday, dumping plenty of rain on townships.

Normanton Airport recorded 259 millimetres, with 186mm of that falling in just three hours.

More than 1,000 customers lost power in the immediate aftermath of the storm, but most were reconnected by Monday night, according to Ergon Energy's power outage map.

Earlier, the company said some areas hit by power cuts were only accessible by air, and it hadn't been able to conduct aerial patrols due to the weather.

Crews would be deployed to assess the damage as soon as it was safe, though repair work could be delayed by flooding, the company said in a statement.

In the meantime, locals were advised to avoid downed power lines.

Flood warnings

Since making landfall on Sunday, the weather system lost strength as it moved further inland, and at 11:00am Monday the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) downgraded it to a tropical low.

The low is moving east-south-east and is expected to bring heavy rainfall that could cause more flash flooding from Cooktown to Ayr in coming days, BOM said in a statement.

Some of the rain is expected to fall on rivers already swollen from recent downpours, which means they are more likely to break their banks.

A severe weather warning is in place for North Tropical Coast and Tablelands, Herbert and Lower Burdekin and parts of Peninsula, Gulf Country and Northern Goldfields and Upper Flinders Forecast Districts.

""Flooding has already been recorded in the Norman and Gilbert catchments, and is expected in North Tropical Coast catchments from late Monday,"" BOM said in a statement.

Grazier isolated from flash flooding

The heaviest downpours between Townsville and Mackay were recorded in the Giru area on Monday, where residents are closely monitoring flash flooding over a crucial road.

Over 24 hours, 180mm was recorded at Majors Creek, 160mm at Giru, 129mm at Cungulla and 125mm at Alligator Creek.

Jamie Gallego at Black Gully Homestead near Giru said he was keeping a close eye on the Black Gully Creek crossing at Woodstock Giru Road.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads has issued a flash flooding warning, with water over the road as of Monday morning.

Mr Gallego said each year his property was isolated from the crossing going under.

""You can guarantee every year it will for a couple of days,"" he said.

""You always keep an eye on it because with the rain we've already had we only need a good deluge or five or six inches and it'll come up again for sure.

""You just make sure you've got all your bare essentials and make sure you have enough food.""

Mr Gallego said the late wet season was desperately needed to produce more feed for cattle in the region.

""It's a late start but it's a good start,"" he said.

""The last couple of days, we've had good, constant rain for a long period.

""The big difference is three months, four months prior to this we were feeding cattle every day because it was so dry.

""If we get a good wet season it'll keep the country going depending on how much winter rain you get.

""But if you don't get any winter rain the rain we get at the beginning of the year [will] probably last till August, maybe September.""

The Bureau of Meteorology issued severe thunderstorm warnings as the system drove in from the west, hitting Penrith before moving across Sydney. The warnings were later extended to the Hunter region including Newcastle.

Ausgrid said a number of NSW towns and Sydney suburbs had power cuts due to the storms.

Meanwhile, widespread flooding is expected over far north Queensland in the coming days from ex-tropical Cyclone Imogen.

The cyclone crossed the coast north of Karumba shortly before 11pm on Sunday before weakening to a tropical low on Monday morning, tracking west across the region.

About 1,400 houses were left without power, but there were no reports of injuries, said the Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll.

‚ÄúIt would appear at this stage there is no massive damage either, but there is a lot of water,‚Äù she told reporters on Monday.

The system dumped 262mm of rain in Normanton, with 186mm of that falling in six hours up until 3am on Monday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology‚Äôs Pieter Claassen.

The town also recorded wind gusts up to 100km/h overnight. As the system weakened to a tropical low, wind gusts up to 85km/h were still being experienced.

Claassen said about 60mm of rain had fallen in Cairns and Innisfail in just a few hours on Monday as the system moved south-east.

The bureau issued a flood watch for large parts of the north of Queensland, with up to 300mm likely to fall in the next 24 hours, and some areas seeing higher totals.

Severe thunderstorms are also forecast for northern Queensland and the south-eastern interior of the state on Monday.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

In Madagascar, heavy rains, strong winds and flooding have been reported in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Eloise in Antalaha, Maroantsetra, Vavatenina and Toamasina districts in the north-east of the country. At least one person died and more than 1,000 people have been affected in these four districts, according to preliminary data from the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC). More than 500 people are displaced in three different communes of Maroantsetra. Most displaced people are seeking shelter with family members, while at least 270 are hosted in temporary accommodation sites. The storm flooded 134 houses and destroyed 56, while nearly 100 classrooms were impacted, including 87 that were damaged and 11 destroyed, according to BNGRC. Eloise could still bring floods and landslides to Sava and Analanjirofo regions, and the districts of Befandriana Avaratra and Mandritsara, according to BNGRC.

As it re-enters the Mozambique Channel, Eloise is expected to gain considerable strength, including due to warm water temperatures and light wind shear, according to media reports. Several weather forecasts indicate that Eloise could become a tropical cyclone as it moves towards Mozambique, including according to MeteoFrance, Mozambique National Meteorology Institute (INAM) and South African Weather Services (SAWS). Although the exact trajectory remains uncertain, INAM predicts that Tropical Cyclone Eloise will make landfall on the evening of 23 January in Inhambane Province, with destructive wind speeds between 150km/h and 170 km/h. Storm surge and torrential rains are also expected. The cyclone will likely impact not only Inhambane but also Gaza, Maputo and Sofala provinces, in southern and central Mozambique.

The cyclone will likely bring heavy downpours and flooding to regions of Mozambique that have already experienced significant rainfall in recent days. The provinces of Inhambane, Manica, Niassa, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia have received between 200mm and 300mm of rains since 9 January, according to INAM, and are predicted to receive heavy rains in the days ahead. The Inhanombe and Mutamba basins in southern Mozambique are both at alert levels‚Äîin addition to the Buzi and Pungoe basins in central Mozambique‚Äîaccording to the latest update from National Directorate of Water Resource Management (DNGRH), released on 20 January.

After landfall, Eloise is expected to lose strength as it crosses land but bring ‚Äúextreme rainfall‚Äù to eastern South Africa, particularly Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, according to SWAS. Depending on its trajectory and intensity, the weather system could also affect Eswatini and south-eastern Zimbabwe"

Early Thursday afternoon it was windy in Adak, but not remarkably so, said Barbara Tolliver, who operates a hunting lodge with her husband on the island.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even aware of the intensity of (the storm),‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA friend from the states texted me.‚Äù

When she looked out her window, she saw blowing snow and birds.

‚ÄúThere are birds flying out there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre having fun on the wind and in the waves.‚Äù

The wind slammed against the house last night, she said. But people were still out caribou hunting Thursday.

Marii Swetzof in Atka said strong winds hit overnight, but lessened during the day.

‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs what we‚Äôd consider a ‚Äònormal‚Äô Aleutian storm,‚Äù she said.

Some boats had come into the harbor to wait out the weather, Swetzof said.

Communities in the Aleutians, including Adak, Atka and Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, were expected to be spared major damage despite the size and intensity of the storm, said Thoman. That‚Äôs only because the storm was centered so far west.

‚ÄúIf we had this exact same storm, except centered between Adak and Dutch (Harbor), we would be talking about big impacts to people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut because it‚Äôs so far west, there‚Äôs just not much there.‚Äù

By the time the storm hurtles into communities to the east, its ferocity was expected to have diminished.

‚ÄúBasically the further east you go into population centers, the lesser the winds will be,‚Äù said Michael Kurz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

It‚Äôll definitely be some weather, but ‚Äúnot that out of the ordinary of what they see this time of year,‚Äù Thoman said.

The highest recorded wind as of midday Thursday was at Shemya, peaking at 83 mph, Thoman said.

‚ÄúBy Shemya standards, that‚Äôs a nice healthy wind but they‚Äôve had much worse,‚Äù he said.

A small military installation on Shemya is ‚Äúof course built to withstand bombing,‚Äù Thoman said.

The storm spawned ‚Äúmonster‚Äù seas, Kurz said. A buoy positioned south of Amchitka registered a 51-foot wave, more than the height of a two-story house, according to Thoman.

The U.S. Coast Guard so far had not been called to help any vessels hit by the storm.

As of 3 p.m. Thursday, ‚Äúall maritime traffic is avoiding the incoming storm in the Bering Sea,‚Äù said Public Affairs Specialist 1st Class Nate Littlejohn of the U.S. Coast Guard. ‚ÄúWe hope mariners in the region will continue to monitor this powerful storm and respect it.‚Äù"

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes persist in Cabo Delgado as households and IDPs lose access to their typical livelihood activities due to the ongoing conflict. In the semi-arid drought-affected areas of central and southern Mozambique, area-level Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes are present. Many poor households remain dependent on market purchases and continue engaging in coping strategies indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3), including reducing the quantity and frequency of meals. The tightening of COVID-19 restrictions has reduced daily income for many poor urban and peri-urban households, with the most affected households likely in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Some areas recovering from the impacts of Cyclone Idai, tropical storm Chalane, and tropical cyclone Eloise are likely facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes.

In January 2021, WFP announced it requires 10.5 million USD monthly to assist around 750,000 IDPs and host community members affected by the conflict in northern Mozambique. Currently, funding is secured through March 2021, but there remains a 108 million USD funding shortfall. WFP is planning to assist 1,428,065 people across Mozambique in January and up to 1,465,177 people in February. However, this plan is subject to changes, particularly as the impact of tropical cyclone Eloise is still being assessed. Humanitarian assistance is likely to be focused on food assistance, shelter, treatment of malnutrition, WASH activities, and educating communities on COVID-19 safety and treatment.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADER), by the end of December 2020, about 90 percent of the planned area for the 2020/2021 agricultural season has been planted in the southern region. However, households in parts of the south attempted to stagger planting dates due to the poor temporal distribution of rainfall. In central and northern Mozambique, around 60 and 50 percent of the planned area has been planted, respectively. Households are likely to keep planting with ongoing rains. However, below-average rainfall in northeastern Mozambique will likely drive below-average planting rates. Most crops are in the vegetative stages, except for some areas of the southern region's interior where crops are in the reproductive stage.

In mid-January, South African authorities announced the closure of 20 land borders, including Ressano Garcia (Lebombo), the main border between Mozambique and South Africa, until February 15. Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 and illegal migration were also strengthened. The border closures are expected to negatively impact cross-border trade and reduce remittances for many poor households, particularly in the southern and central regions. The slowdown in informal food commodity trade across the border is expected to drive price increases of processed products from South Africa and further reduce household purchasing power in urban and peri-urban areas.

On January 23, tropical cyclone Eloise made landfall with its epicenter over the district of B√∫zi in Sofala province with winds of more than 120 kilometers per hour and over 200 mm of rainfall in 12 hours. The provinces of Sofala and Manica were the most affected, along with parts of Zamb√©zia, Inhambane, and Gaza. According to preliminary information from the National Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction (INGD), as of January 28, at least 314,000 people have been affected, with more than 20,000 people displaced. More than 29,000 houses have been destroyed, damaged, or flooded, mainly in Buzi, Dondo, Nhamatanda, Muanza, and Beira City, and more than 177,000 hectares of planted crops have been flooded."

Five African countries were among the global top 10 to suffer extreme weather in 2019, the Climate Risk Index 2021, released by environmental think tank Germanwatch said January 25, 2021.

The index also ranked India as the country that suffered the second-highest monetary loss due to climate change in 2019 after Japan. The index was released ahead of the climate adaption summit that began virtually January 25 and is hosted by the Netherlands.

It also showed that eight out of the ten countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2019 belong to the category of low to lower-middle income. Five of them fall into the category of Least Developed Countries.

Africa, India on top

Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, South Sudan and Niger were the five African countries among the ten most-affected due to extreme weather in 2019 according to the index. Mozambique and Zimbabwe were ranked first and second. Malawi was ranked fifth, South Sudan eighth and Niger ninth.

Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi made it to the list primarily due to Cyclone Idai. The deadliest and costliest tropical cyclone in the south-west Indian Ocean, Idai was labelled as ‚Äúone of the worst weather-related catastrophes in the history of Africa‚Äù by United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres.

It affected three million people and claimed over 1,000 lives, caused economic losses amounting to Rs 16,500 crore.

In 2019, most lives lost due to climate change were in India, which also suffered the second-highest monetary loss. India was the seventh-most affected country on the index.

In 2019, the southwest monsoon continued for a month longer than usual. The surplus of rain caused major hardship, the report said. Some 2,267 Indians died due to the extreme weather and the country lost $68,812.

With eight tropical cyclones, the year 2019 was one of the most active Northern Indian Ocean cyclone seasons on record. Six of the eight cyclones intensified to become ‚Äúvery severe‚Äù, the report said.

Poverty‚Äôs curse

The long-term risk index mapped in the report for the last two decades also showed that low to lower-middle income countries had been the most affected.

In two decades (2000-2019), over 475,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of more than 11,000 extreme weather events globally and losses amounted to around $2.56 trillion (in purchasing power parities).

Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti were the most-affected countries during these two decades. They are followed by the Philippines, Mozambique and the Bahamas.

The countries most impacted by extreme weather events should consider the index as a warning sign that they are at risk of either frequent events or rare but extraordinary catastrophes, the report said."

He said the cyclone may move close enough to the coast to bring gale force winds, heavy rainfall and abnormally high tides to coastal districts.

Since 9:00am, 237 millimetres of rain has fallen at Clump Point at Mission Beach, south of Innisfail.

Other totals include 180mm at Cowley Beach and 176mm at South Mission Beach.

About 200mm of rain fell in areas south of Cairns over the 24 hours to 9:00am, including 219mm at Alva Beach, 196mm at Ayr and 183mm at Lucinda and Groper Creek.

As of 3:00pm, more than 40,000 homes were without power.

The Bruce Highway has been cut near Deeral, north of Innisfail, due to fallen powerlines.

Fallen powerlines closed the Captain Cook Highway for a number of hours on Monday morning, causing major traffic delays in the city. The road has since reopened.

The Gillies Range, which connects Cairns to the Atherton Tablelands, has also been closed after several traffic incidents.

An emergency alert has been issued for Palm Island residents who are being told to brace for the tropical low, with power outages already occurring on the island due to fallen trees and powerlines.

The council advised that ferry services and flights to and from the island were suspended.

The island's cemetery was closed after days of intense rainfall which caused saturation.

Residents are also being asked to fill containers with clean water in case of widespread power outages.

Six state schools south of Cairns have been closed due to flooding, including Babinda, Murray River and South Johnstone State Schools.

11,000 Catholic school students have also been told not to attend school tomorrow across the Cairns district, with 28 of its schools closing until at least Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the BOM is waiting on a part needed to repair the Hervey Range radar.

""There is a technical issue with the Townsville radar and it is currently offline,"" a spokesperson said.

""Our technicians are working to rectify the issue as a priority. Warning services and forecasts are not impacted.""

He said BOM expected the issue to be rectified by Thursday.

SES Area Controller for the Northern Region, John Forde, said the team did use the radar for operational planning, with crews already responding to callouts.

""Apart from being an inconvenience, it does actually cause us some operational issues as well,"" he said.

""It also helps us with planning as to when we can put crews out into the field and when we can't, and when we know we're going to get an increase in calls, when we see those rain bands come across.

""If we have the radar up and running we know to expect some additional calls at certain times of the day.""

Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said ""it's not good enough"", with a cyclone brewing in the region.

""To have service technicians only available in Cairns and Brisbane, is a bloody big stretch. It's ridiculous. This state is nearly three times the size of Victoria,"" she said.

""When you've got inclement weather, how the hell are they going to get here?"""

The priority needs reported in all of the accommodation centres are food, followed by water and shelter (DTM, INGD 31/01/2021).

From 9 January until 23 January when Eloise made landfall in Mozambique, the provinces of Inhambane, Manica, Niassa, Sofala, Tete, and Zambezia received heavy rains (IFRC 22/01/2021). Sofala province and the entire Zambezi Basin also experienced heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flooding prior to Eloise. The districts hit hardest by the heavy rains were Beira (neighbourhoods Mungassa and Ndunda I e II), Buzi, Muanza, Caia, Dondo, Marromeu, and Nhamatanda. The pre-cyclone rains affected more than 21,500 people and more than 1,900 houses (ECHO 23/01/2021; OCHA 22/01/2021)."

Many fear that travelers brought in the South African COVID-19 variant, which is more infectious, during the December festive season. Information on social media of funeral parlors upscaling services and failing to meet demand have also led to anxiety about the extent of the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of high-ranking government officials.‚Äù

‚ÄúDue to recent flooding and mudslides, many people were temporarily displaced from their homes, losing their livelihoods, crops and livestock. Upon returning to their homes, many have been forced to share the few cramped spaces left undamaged within their homes. The storm has also destroyed irrigation schemes, granaries, kraals and chicken runs for many households who depended on them for their livelihoods. What is especially concerning is that the cyclone has reduced access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, services that are crucial in the fight against COVID-19. The storm has also made it difficult for those affected to stay in line with preventative measures because water and sanitation infrastructure has been damaged and belongings, including masks, have been destroyed in the storm. People in evacuation centers are at risk of COVID-19 due to lack of hygiene support. Many of those affected need soap, detergents, blankets, buckets, water treatment chemicals and mosquito nets. IRC‚Äôs teams are on the ground to provide support but it is still raining. We have reached out to families affected by Cyclone Eloise with emergency items and cash. With more funding, IRC can scale up support to those most affected.‚Äù

The IRC began working in Zimbabwe in 2008 to respond to the devastating cholera outbreak and has since significantly scaled up our programming to work with local communities to improve sanitation, access to clean water, safe delivery for pregnant women, and livelihood opportunities and improved agriculture for farmers.

It was early February, 2011, just shy of five years after category four Cyclone Larry tore roofs off houses, felled powerlines and packed a knock-out punch to cane and banana farmers in the Tully region.

Cyclone Yasi, which had formed in Fijian waters, was following a similar course and had its sights set firmly on the most populous northern cities of Cairns and Townsville.

Bureau of Meteorology Queensland severe weather manager Vikash Prasad said Yasi's path never waivered as it made a beeline toward the Queensland coast, rapidly intensifying to become a category five storm, the most severe in Australia's cyclone monitoring system.

On the morning of February 3, Cyclone Yasi made landfall near Mission Beach as one of the most powerful systems to ever impact built-up areas of Queensland.

Hunkered down on the floor of his Innisfail office, was then Cassowary Coast Regional Council Mayor Bill Shannon.

On the floor above him, a team of about 20 emergency services personnel were monitoring the situation.

One floor above them, in the council hall, were 800 nervous evacuees, who had no where else to go after being forced to flee caravan parks or beachfront properties in the region.

Mr Shannon said while a huge amount of work had been done to prepare for the cyclone, it was impossible to know exactly where it would hit.

""I could see the roof going off the office next door, I had a sleeping bag and a few essentials and the phone rang hot all night,"" he said.

The next day, after it became safe to venture out, the extent of the devastation became clear.

But exact records of just how powerful the storm was are hard to come by.

Yasi had knocked out the BoM weather station at Willis Island, which had been evacuated, passing over as a category four storm before it slammed into the mainland.



However, a barograph at the Tully Sugar Mill recorded a minimum pressure of 929 hPa as the eye passed over, suggesting wind gusts of about 285km/h were possible.



Significant wind damage was reported between Innisfail and Townsville where the destructive core of the cyclone crossed the coast, while Tully and Cardwell suffered major damage to structures and vegetation, with the eye of the cyclone passing over Dunk Island and Tully.

Banana and cane growers had dusted themselves off after Larry, which many considered to be a once-in-a-generation storm.

But Yasi came in behind to deliver the sucker punch.

Rainfall totals between Cairns and Ayr were between 200-300mm in 24 hours and caused some flooding.



The highest totals were along the Tully and Herbert River catchments, with South Mission Beach recording 471mm; Hawkins Creek, 464mm; Zattas, 407mm; while Bulgun Creek had 373mm.



Mr Shannon said Clive Palmer had loaned the Cassowary Coast Regional Council a six-seater helicopter, and paid for the pilot and fuel, to allow him to survey the area.



""To see the devastation from the air, from Innisfail to Cardwell, was quite amazing,"" he said.



""Hull Heads and Tully Heads were really badly devastated. The waves of the tidal surge alone came through the height of single story buildings, so you could imagine the damage done.""

Overall, the damage bill was in the billions, with Insurance Council of Australia data showing $1.33b was paid out after 72,203 claims were lodged.



Mr Shannon said his most important role in the aftermath was to be a sounding board for the community.

""My role, even that first night with 800 people hunkered down in the town hall, was to go and talk to people to have that calming effect and make things a bit easier.

Meunga and Kennedy Creeks burst their banks and Carruchan was cut off for a week. Picture: Jeff Snell

""You get different reactions, the first is often stoicism, people just want to get in and fix it and ask where do we start, then some people get quite depressed, or angry, there are several stages.

""But overall, it's the stoicism and let's get it done aspect of Australian society that comes through.

""I didn't really have any power, it was just to make doors open and have a calming effect, a figurehead, that's what it was, being there talking to people, being a reassurance.""



Mr Shannon said there was relief as the army rolled into town, with soldiers doing the rounds of rural blocks, clearing driveways to free trapped residents.

""The army guys did a fantastic job and to hear them go past in the personnel carriers was extremely reassuring.""



The SES and Red Cross were a force to be reckoned with, as were community members who set up Cassowary feeding stations to save the endangered birds whose natural food sources had been obliterated."

SUVA, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts said on Tuesday that all schools nationwide will remain closed this week and will reopen on Feb. 8.

A total of 406 evacuation centers still remain active across the country, out of which 132 are schools.

About 14,322 people are still taking shelter due to damages sustained to their homes brought by tropical cyclone Ana over the weekend.

The Minister for Education Rosy Akbar said many teachers are also affected by water and electricity disruptions and most of them are helping their families to clean up and bring normalcy in their lives.

School heads and managements are requested to ensure schools are prepared well before students and teachers return to school next week.

The Ministry is still conducting a damage assessment survey to ascertain the levels of damage sustained by tropical cyclone Ana as many were still recovering and rebuilding due to tropical cyclone Yasa last December.

Meanwhile, Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has started his tour in areas affected by tropical cyclone Ana.

Bainimarama's first visit was to Naitasiri, one of the 14 provinces on Viti Levu, the main island that has been badly affected by floodwaters and is the main point of entry to Nausori Town and Suva, the capital of Fiji.

He has reassured Fijians who are badly affected that help is on the way.

Last December, tropical cyclone Yasa hit Fiji, killing four people and causing extensive damage to houses and schools, especially in the northern part of the island nation.

The tropical cyclone season in the South Pacific region runs between November and April every year and Fiji was predicted to experience up to three tropical cyclones during the current season. Enditem"

It was a decent enough living and there was a healthy export market.

Majnu Sardar, who lives in Koyra upazila (administrative region) in Khulna district, used to earn enough to feed, clothe and educate his family of six. Now they are living in a small mud hut, with a canopy of leaves as a roof, on the banks of the Kapotaksha River after Cyclone Amphan buried his house and land in May.

About 80% of export orders for shrimp, worth about $54m (¬£39m), were cancelled between July and December last year.

The drop in exports saw local shrimp prices more than halve. That came just weeks after Amphan, the fiercest storm to hit the region this century, destroyed boats and equipment.

We were going upwards economically. I‚Äôm going down very fast now Nur Islam

‚ÄúThis is causing a lot of trouble,‚Äù says Sardar. ‚ÄúLast year the Covid-19 virus and cyclone dropped me to zero. I have lost the capital for shrimp farming. I am carrying the burden of debt. I have become a day labourer from a shrimp farmer. I don‚Äôt know how it will go in the future.‚Äù

Sardar is one of many still in temporary shelters, while others have upped and left for the capital Dhaka in search of work.

Muslima Begum, 36, a shrimp farmer from Koyra upazila, used to earn a living wage, but now she is dependent on any work her husband, Mosharraf Hossain, can find.

‚ÄúWe have never faced such a crisis before,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost about 1 lakh taka (more than ¬£800). I am in debt. Shrimp will not be cultivated this year. I don‚Äôt know how the day will go.

‚ÄúIt is now very difficult to provide food for five members of the family. Before, I got nutritious food from the vegetable garden near the house. Everything was destroyed in the cyclone, now everything has to be bought from the market. And [with] the high price of all products in the market, it is not possible for us to buy everything like before.‚Äù

Nur Islam, 45, from Assasuni upazila, in Satkhira district, says his business is dead. ‚ÄúI have been making a living by shrimp farming for several years. There are small problems at different times. Losses occur when shrimp farms are infected with a virus. But if one year goes bad, the next year it makes up for the loss again,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúBut this time I was completely finished.‚Äù

Farmers have taken out loans or sold off their assets. Islam sold his cow to pay off his arrears to the landowner ‚Äì and to buy a small boat that he uses to ferry people across the river. He earns up to 300 taka (¬£2.60) a day. His family of six now have only two meals a day. His daughter had to be taken out of school because Islam couldn‚Äôt afford the fees, and he‚Äôs had to stop sending his son money to help him through college.

‚ÄúI have never imagined that I would have to make a living by selling cows and buying boats.

On 23 January, Cyclone Eloise made landfall in Mozambique, bringing powerful winds, torrential rain and severe flooding. The storm damaged and destroyed farmland, vital infrastructure and thousands of homes, dealing another devastating blow to families still trying to put their lives together after Cyclone Idai struck, less than two years ago.

Around 250,000 people, including 130,000 children, in central Mozambique are likely to need humanitarian assistance, according to government estimates. Children living in the affected areas, particularly those who have been displaced, could soon be at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoeal infections.

UNICEF is on the ground, helping to assess the damage to ensure swift and effective relief for children and their families.

In the port city of Beira, and in rural areas, severe flooding has impacted families still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which struck in March 2019 and displaced thousands of people.

Some roads in central Mozambique are now impassable, hindering access to some villages and hampering efforts to bring much-needed assistance.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of hectares of crops have been flooded, which could impact the next harvest in April.

Even before Cyclone Eloise struck, nearly half of the population was living below the poverty line, while some 43 per cent of children under 5 years old were severely or moderately stunted. Meanwhile, the conflict in Cabo Delgado, in the north of the country, has displaced more than half a million people. Basic services have been severely disrupted and affected families are in urgent need of shelter, food, protection and access to health care and safe drinking water. The COVID-19-related economic slowdown has only exacerbated these needs.

How UNICEF is helping

UNICEF‚Äôs emergency teams deployed to Beira before Cyclone Eloise hit, allowing teams to quickly distribute prepositioned supplies.

I haven‚Äôt yet returned to my home. I know my house collapsed and I lost everything. Fortunately, my children are doing well. - Catarina, 27

UNICEF and partners have been erecting tents to provide desperately needed shelter for families displaced by the storm.

UNICEF is also working with partners to provide health professionals with medical supplies and families with basic hygiene kits, including soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste.

The potential outbreak of waterborne diseases like diarrhoea and cholera is a major concern in flooded areas.

UNICEF is therefore urgently working with the Government and partners to make sure that the victims of the cyclone have access to safe drinking water to prevent the spread of disease.

UNICEF is also working with partners to assess needs, prioritize support to the most vulnerable, and ensure the protection of children.

Frequently recurring shocks of drought, flooding, and violence have left little opportunity for Mozambican families to recover, especially those who live below the poverty line."

Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Johnathan How said there was a 20 to 50 per cent chance of the low forming into a cyclone on Monday.



""We're monitoring a tropical low in the Coral Seas as it drives heavy rain across northern Queensland,"" Mr How said.



""Conditions are favourable for it to develop into a tropical cyclone next week but there is still some uncertainty about its movement and development and where we will see the heaviest rain.

""The system is sitting north east of Cairns and for now isn't much more than mass of cloud and thunderstorms but it is poised to become more organised and strengthen over the coming days.""

Mr How said large rainfall totals have been building along the coast in the last 24 hours, adding to the 200mm-300mm recorded over the last week.

A flood watch has been issued for the coast between Mission Beach and Rollingstone, and this is expected to expand to include Townsville and surrounding areas over coming days.



""Catchments there are already saturated following last weekend's flooding and will respond quickly to further rainfall,"" Mr How said.

""Rainfall will ramp up through the weekend, at first focused around the coastal strip and by Sunday we could see heavy falls develop and extend inland.

""There is still uncertainty into next week and actual totals will depend on how the low moves.

Peace Winds JapanÔºàPWJÔºâand its local partner Dhaka Community Hospital Trust (DCHT) started emergency relief operations in August in Galachipa Upazila of Patuakhali District and Sarankhola Upazila of Bagerhat District. Fishery and fish/shrimp farming are the most common occupation in this area and were severely affected as heavy rain and high waves caused by the Cyclone have washed away the fish farms and have contaminated the fresh water sources. People‚Äôs lives had already been affected by COVID-19 before the Cyclone Amphan, and the community is facing a double burden of the negative impact of both COVID-19 and the cyclone damage. Many people have lost their livelihood and opportunity of income earning by this.

PWJ distributed food packages and tarpaulin as emergency relief items to the vulnerable people affected by the cyclone. Many beneficiaries especially appreciated the tarpaulin since heavy rain had continued in this area even after the cyclone made landfall, and many houses had damaged roofs with rain water leaking inside the house. Fishing nets were distributed to those working for fishery and fish farms that have lost their livelihoods due to the cyclone.

COVID-19 cases are increasing in the cyclone affected areas as well as other parts of Bangladesh. Patients with water borne diseases, especially diarrhea, are increasing in the affected areas due to the contamination of water and deterioration of hygiene conditions caused by the cyclone. Soaps, cloth masks and ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) were distributed and awareness on handwashing and hygiene was provided along with the distribution of relief items.

In order to avoid congestion at distribution points as precautions of COVID-19, relief items and awareness were provided through household visits. Relief items and awareness were provided to the hard to reach households by using boats and walking through muddy roads.

Many of the tube-wells had been contaminated due to the cyclone and many people were facing difficulties in obtaining safe drinking water. Two deep tube-wells were constructed to enable safe water provision to the cyclone affected community. Safe drinking water is indispensable for the prevention for water borne and infectious diseases and especially for hand washing. The community appreciated the construction of the tube-well as they do not need to walk a long distance to fetch drinking water anymore.

The tube-well was handed over to the community, and the community committee will be in charge of the management and maintenance of the tube-well. A maintenance training was conducted to the community committee with the participation of community leaders and religious leaders.

All activities have been completed on November 30th. Thank you very much for your kind support. *This project is funded with subsidies from the Japan Platform and donations from individuals and corporations."

It was estimated that about $350 million of bananas were destroyed, with growers in Tully, Cardwell and Innisfail copping the bulk of the damage.

Historically low banana production meant a box of bananas was $100, and in supermarkets reached $14/kg.



Australian Bananas Growers' Council chairman Stephen Lowe said the industry had taken a significant battering.

""The Tully and Cardwell banana growing areas were 100 per cent wiped out,"" Mr Lowe said.



""I remember visiting the farm the next morning to find there were three banana trees left standing in a field completely flattened.



""It's a bit despairing, but I guess it comes with farming and that you're going to have some form of crop disaster at some stage, normally weather driven.""

Mr Lowe said it doesn't feel like it's been 10 years since the Cyclone hit but is thankful that was the last severe storm the region has had.

""I'm glad it is because having a cyclone every five years would completely destroy our industry, we couldn't cope with that,"" he said.

""That was the problem with Yasi, it had only been five years since Larry had devastated the area.""

Former Australian Bananas Growers' Council chairman Cameron Mackay's Banana farm in Tully was also wiped out by the cyclone.



""We were producing around two and half million cartons a year and in 2011, we produced about half a million,"" Mr Mackay said.



He said growers have diversified and are growing in different areas.

""More and more bananas now are growing outside of the traditional Tully and Innisfail area and are growing inland.""

The Mackay family purchased a farm in Lakeland in 2012 after Cyclone Yasi.

""Losing 100 per cent of your income makes you think twice about where you're going to keep on producing your crops,"" Mr Mackay said.

""We made the shift to Lakeland which has been a very good shift for our business.""

Government assistance

Mr Mackay said growers in the far north also received state and federal government support to help growers get through, similar to the job keeper.

""We had that for growers impacted and there were also low interest or no interest loans available through the state government,"" he said.

""The funding got them to the other side, so they were back producing into a market that was going to be sustainable.""

Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries and Minister for Rural Communities Mark Furner said that under the Federal Government's guidelines for the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements, damage assessments must be carried out to understand the level of impact.

""However, individual property owners who have suffered significant loss because of the cyclone can apply immediately for an Individual Disaster Stricken Property declaration, which makes immediate assistance available to them,"" Mr Furner said.

""As we go through the Federal Government's required assessment process, my Department right now has IDSP declarations activated that mean producers can access up to $5000 for freight costs and low-interest loans up to $250,000.

Mr Furner said the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries had staff in the region ahead of Cyclone Niran's effect on coastal regions.

""Our officers are experienced in providing rapid assistance to our farmers and in conducting these assessments, and I have asked the Department to have this completed as soon as possible,"" he said.

""It is hoped assessments in the Cassowary Coast region will be completed by the end of the week, and some of the other regions in the coming days. These assessments will be ongoing.""

Banana farmers have suffered heavy losses, with some saying they‚Äôve lost 100% of their crops.
The Australian Banana Growers‚Äô Council said it was too early to estimate losses, but it was clear the bill would be significant, particularly for growers around Innisfail and most of the Cassowary Coast region.

Niran was expected to become a category three storm within 24 hours and while it was not expected to cross the coast, gale-force winds stripped banana trees, leaving farmers in despair.

Niran was on Wednesday a category two cyclone sitting 335km north-east of Cairns, packing sustained winds of 100km/h, gusting to 140km/h.

A warning for gale-force winds was current from Cape Melville, north of Cooktown, to Innisfail, south of Cairns.

About 4,000 people were without power in the Cairns region on Wednesday morning, down from about 42,000 on Monday afternoon when Niran ‚Äì then just a low pressure system ‚Äì pushed damaging winds ashore.

State Emergency Service teams were busy attending to damaged roofs and downed trees, and there were reports of minor structural damage to sheds and outbuildings in the Cairns area.

Banana farmers have suffered heavy losses, with some saying they‚Äôve lost 100% of their crops.

The Australian Banana Growers‚Äô Council said it was too early to estimate losses, but it was clear the bill would be significant, particularly for growers around Innisfail and most of the Cassowary Coast region.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another bitter blow to growers who have suffered enormously with consecutive years of low prices and more recently critical worker shortages due to Covid,‚Äù council chair Stephen Lowe said.

But the council did not expect banana prices to skyrocket in the wake of the storm, with the Tully and Lakeland growers escaping much of the damage.

‚ÄúIf there is a short firming of retail prices, it would be only for the short term,‚Äù a spokesperson for the council told the Guardian. ‚ÄúWhile this event is devastating for those affected, the price impact will be nowhere like that seen after Cyclone Yasi, when a large majority of the industry was hit.‚Äù

Cassowary Coast grower Dianne Sciacca said she and her farmer neighbours expected to be without incomes until September or October.

‚ÄúMost of the farms beside us, they‚Äôre looking at 90 to 100% [damage], we‚Äôre probably 80 to 90,‚Äù she has told the ABC.

Communities from Cape Melville to Innisfail, including Cooktown, Port Douglas and Cairns were warned to prepare for more wild weather before the cyclone began to track further offshore.

The Townsville radar went offline on Sunday but the Australian Bureau of Meteorology reassured the community this hadn‚Äôt affected its ability to issue forecasts and warnings.

It was estimated to be up and running again by Thursday.

Two people were rescued from floodwaters near the Star River, west of Townsville, about 9.30pm on Monday.

The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said residents should follow the BoM for updates.

‚ÄúMy main message today to people in the far north, and they‚Äôve dealt with heavy rain before and cyclones so they know exactly what they‚Äôre doing, but if it‚Äôs flooded, forget it,‚Äù she said on Tuesday.

Tara Bennett, from Tourism Port Douglas Daintree, said her area had not suffered any damage.

She was worried reports of wild weather across the far north could result in more cancellations for local operators, who are heavily dependent on international tourists who can‚Äôt visit because of the pandemic.

‚ÄúWe have barely had a gust of wind or rain,‚Äù she has told the ABC. ‚ÄúI want people to be confident that our travel experiences are open. In a day or two the skies will be clear.‚Äù"

The Bureau of Meteorology said coastal crossing of the cyclone is not expected.



""Tropical cyclone Niran remains slow-moving with increasing system organisations and structure,"" the BoM spokesperson said.



Rainfall totals in the past 24 hours have decreased in North Queensland as Cylone Niran adopts a southeasterly track and accelerates away from the coast. Map: BoM

""A slower than normal rate of development is forecast in the next 12 to 18 hours, becoming a category 3 tonight.



""Beyond that, there may be a slight drop in shear as it begins to move southeastswards.""



BoM said further intensification may occur in the short term before the system begins to shear under the subtropical jet on Friday.



""The steering pattern remains weak for now due to the system lying inbetween mid-level anticyclones, and a weak upper trough to the south,"" the spokesperson said.

""There isn't any numerical weather guidance suggesting a westward movement of the system, hence a coastal crossing is ruled out.



""However, as the system deepens over the next 24 hours, there remains some possibility of gales being experienced on exposed mainland and island areas on Queensland's north tropical coast.



""All numerical model guidance agrees that a stronger upper trough will capture the system on Thursday and move it rapidly away to the east-southeast. ""

Gale Hazards for coastal communities

As the cyclone strengthens, it may produce gales about exposed coastal and island communities later today or early on Thursday.



GALES with gusts to 100km/h may develop about exposed coastal and island communities between Cape Melville and Innisfail, including Cooktown, Port Douglas, and Cairns, later today or early on Thursday as the cyclone intensifies.



On Thursday, the cyclone is expected to adopt a southeasterly track and accelerate away from the coast.

The slow-moving category two system is hovering about 280 kilometres north-east of Cairns.

Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecaster Rosa Hoff said the cyclone was expected to gradually intensify while remaining well offshore.

""We're not expecting the system to cross the coast,"" Ms Hoff said.

""It should remain slow-moving, very close to its current location as it develops slowly into a category three cyclone over the next two days.

""After that, we are expecting it to move off in a south-easterly direction, most likely on Thursday.""

The system has dumped heavy rain across the region, including 276mm at Clump Point and 227mm at Davies Reef within 24 hours.

A powerful 124kmph wind gust was recorded at Arlington Reef near Cairns and 94kmph gust was recorded at Lucinda.

Wild weather not over yet

""Gale-force winds with damaging wind gusts up to 100 kilometres per hour and areas of heavy rain could redevelop over the tropical east coast of Queensland over the next couple of days, including tonight or even potentially tomorrow,"" Ms Hoff said.

""It's going to be a long few days for the communities in the region.""

Emergency services have met in Cairns to discuss their response to Tropical Cyclone Niran.

Heavy rain and winds associated with the weather system saw many communities in the area lose power.

Queensland police, Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, Queensland Ambulance Service and local government authorities held a district disaster management meeting to look at community safety.

Cairns Acting Chief Superintendent Chris Hodgman said 150 extra workers would be deployed to help restore power.

""Tomorrow morning Ergon will have at least 150 staff on the ground looking at the power issues and they're trying their best to prioritise those that need an immediate response,"" Acting Chief Superintendent Hodgman said.

""Unfortunately there's still some people without power and there's others without communications.

""It's such a dangerous situation when powerlines are down but it's also frustrating unfortunately for the population around Cairns to not have power.

""It's a really good reminder for us to be prepared when these events come along.""

Battered banana crops

Innisfail banana grower Robert Zahra said his crops had sustained ""devastating"" damage.

""We were just working as normal yesterday morning ‚Ä¶ [the] bureau was just saying a little bit of rain and bit of strong wind but it obviously got a lot worse than that,"" he said.

""We just kept picking as much as we could yesterday morning until they started falling down around us.""

He said they stopped picking when the strong winds increased and it wasn't safe to continue.

""It was like a freight train out there in the paddock ‚Ä¶ you've just got to make the call,"" he said.

Mr Zahra said he was still working out how much of the crop was damaged.

""Anything with a bunch cover on it is on the ground, there's nothing standing at all in places,"" he said.

Meanwhile, rain has drenched parts of the coast with Alva Beach receiving 219 millimetres in the past 24 hours, while Lucinda had 186mm and Groper Creek received 183mm.

The BOM is warning the system has sustained winds near the centre of 75kph with wind gusts of up to 100kph.

Communities between Cape Flattery and Lucinda are in the warning zone, with a flood watch issued for catchments between Cooktown and Rollingstone.

Seven state schools and 32 Catholic and independent schools have been closed.

State Emergency Service (SES) area controller, Peter Rinaudo said the SES had responded to 127 job so far, mostly for downed trees and powerlines that had cut electricity to thousands of homes.

""For a system that wasn't a cyclone [at the time yesterday], it certainly created a lot of interest for us, we had a lot of wind, a lot of rain and a lot of jobs for something that wasn't crossing our coast,"" Mr Rinaudo said.

""The current situation as we're being told by the Bureau of Meteorology is the system, that impacted Cairns quite heavily yesterday and at one stage was approximately 90 kilometres off the coast, has now moved further away towards the north-east.""

But emergency responders remain on high alert, with a chance heavy rain will redevelop later this evening and tomorrow.

""The catchments are still saturated, so any water we're still getting into those catchment's can potentially produce some sort of flooding that may impact roadways and creeks,"" Mr Rinaudo said.

""Some of our gusts getting up around the 85 to 90 kilometre [per hour] mark ‚Äî it's knocking some of these trees over and pulling powerlines down.

""[We're] not being able to do much in regards to leaking roofs ‚Äî when you've got 85 kilometre per hour winds, it doesn't lend itself very well to be holding a tarp down.""

Power cut to thousands of homes

Yesterday's wild weather cut power to more than 40,000 properties from Cairns to the Cassowary Coast.

Ergon spokeswoman Emma Oliveri urged residents to be patient while crews worked to reconnect homes.

""We've got outages right across the board, which makes it all the more challenging for our crews,"" Ms Oliveri said.

""We've got a lot of damage from vegetation, damage to the network, including fallen powerlines.

""In these conditions everything is changeable, and crews may not be able to get into certain areas if roads are cut due to localised flooding."""

Niran is expected to affect New Caledonia as a destructive category 4 storm on Saturday.

Niran took advantage of low wind shear of 5-10 knots and warm ocean temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius (84¬∞F) to rapidly intensity by 35 mph in just six hours on Friday, peaking as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds and a central pressure of 917 mb at 8 am EST March 5, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Niran‚Äôs intensity was estimated via the standard Dvorak technique, which uses infrared satellite imagery.

High wind shear is expected to gradually weaken Niran, but the cyclone is expected to be at category 4 strength as it moves along the south shore of New Caledonia‚Äôs largest island, Grande Terre, between 0 UTC and 12 UTC Saturday. Heavy damage is likely on the island, and Niran‚Äôs eyewall will pass perilously close to the capital city of Noumea (population 95,000).

Earlier this week, Niran brought heavy rains and high winds to Australia‚Äôs Queensland state, causing damage to the banana crop estimated at $138 million. Niran did not make landfall in Australia.

South Pacific Ocean tropical cyclone history

NOAA‚Äôs hurricane history database lists 14 other tropical cyclones in the South Pacific Ocean that have achieved category 5 strength since 1988; accurate satellite data in the region dates to about 1990. The most recent Cat 5, Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020, caused widespread destruction in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga, killing 30 and causing more than $120 million in damage.

Three tropical cyclones are tied for being the most powerful storms on record in the South Pacific (all with 180 mph winds): Tropical Cyclone Winston (2016), Tropical Cyclone Zoe (2002), and Tropical Cyclone Monica (2006). Monica (in Australia) and Winston (in Fiji) both made landfall while at category 5 strength.

Niran is Earth‚Äôs second category 5 storm of 2021, the other being Tropical Cyclone Faraji, which reached category 5 strength on February 8 in the South Indian Ocean. It is uncommon to have two Southern Hemisphere Cat 5s so early in the year; the last time this occurred was in 2015, when Tropical Cyclone Eunice became the Southern Hemisphere‚Äôs second Cat 5 on January 30. There are only two years on record when the Southern Hemisphere has recorded as many as three category 5 storms: 2015 and 2003.

Earth averaged 5.3 category 5 storms per year between 1990 and 2020, according to ratings made by NOAA‚Äôs National Hurricane Center and the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The quality of the Cat 5 database is too poor and the time series of decent data on these storms too short to make definitive conclusions about how climate change may be affecting these most fearsome of storms. However, climate change is expected to make category 5 storms stronger and more numerous in coming decades.

In Central Mozambique, over 104,000 people continue to live in resettlement sites and accommodation centres as a result of the 3 cyclones that have hit the same area of the country over the past 2 year ‚Äì the most recent at the start of 2021.

In Northern Mozambique, where cyclone Kenneth hit in 2019, nearly 670,000 people are currently displaced, with the insecurity continuing to expand in scale, scope and complexity, pointing to potential further deterioration and additional displacement in 2021.

According to Marie David, Acting Assistant Country Director, CARE Mozambique; ‚Äúmuch of the hard-won progress aid agencies such as CARE had made over the past 2 years to help those affected by Cyclone Idai has been destroyed once again over the last few months as a result of the cyclones. In some cases, much of the infrastructure still hadn‚Äôt been repaired from Idai, and clean drinking water remained a challenge, so people were already in a weak and vulnerable situation when Eloise struck. In addition, floods have affected the ability of those who had been displaced to cultivate subsistence crops, which in turn has led to rising food insecurity. On top of all this, communicable disease outbreaks such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic is causing complex and compounded disasters across the country.‚Äù

Cyclone Idai made landfall on 14th March 2019, killing over 1,000 people and destroying more than 100,000 homes. Despite a massive global effort to raise money for the response, the humanitarian plan was less than 50% funded. More than 250,000 people are estimated to have been affected by cyclone Eloise, which made landfall on 23 January in the central Sofala province. At the end of 2020, Tropical Storm Chalane made landfall in Muanza District destroying shelters, and displacing for a second time, over 270 families already living in settlements for survivors of Cyclone Idai where around 90,000 people still live.

Mozambique continues to experience recurrent climatic shocks, including tropical storms, flooding and back-to-back droughts in the southern part of the country. The lack of sustained funding, and concurrent climate-induced weather events across Mozambique over the past years has gaping holes in the ability of aid agencies to meet the immediate needs of devastated families or invest in longer term strategies to help communities build resilience and reduce risks associated with disasters.

Chica Manuel Catita a 24-year-old mother of three says; ‚Äúsince the cyclones started, our life is getting worse and worse. We are suffering a setback in our life because of the cyclones and floods. We try to do something, but it always does not work out. We try to cultivate but floods always wipe out our fields. We try to rebuild our lives, but we always lose everything. Everything we do ends up being destroyed. Cyclone Idai caused devastation and heavy loss of life, Cyclone Eloise also did the damage, and the last one destroyed everything. We have not been able to harvest anything on our farms. These cyclones are bringing hunger in our life.‚Äù

The population in Central Mozambique is alarmingly vulnerable to future climate shocks. The South Indian Ocean has seen an increase in the intensity of storms as a result of climate change.

‚ÄúTwo years ago, Cyclone Idai showed the world what climate change was capable of, and since then there has been no relief for the people of Mozambique and no opportunity for recovery. The most vulnerable communities continue to pay the price for climate change while more wealthy countries take the time to deliberate over weak climate action targets and finance goals. Instead, rich countries should increase their financial contributions immediately, delivering climate adaptation and loss and damage finance as separate funding mechanisms. Contributing to climate risk financing would also help insure communities against these frequent and devastating climactic shocks,‚Äù said Chikondi Chabvuta, CARE‚Äôs Southern Africa Regional Advocacy Advisor.

As part of its integrated humanitarian response to the cyclones, CARE has distributed drought-resistant seeds, which include sorghum, cowpeas, ground nuts, pineapple seedlings, maize and millet, to more than 4,000 small scale farmers in the central region where crops were destroyed by the storms. CARE has also been providing basic training in improved agricultural practices that present benefits to farmers and land along traditional practices. These techniques will help communities combat the effects of climate change going forward.

We know that hurricanes and other tropical cyclones have devastating effects on society, particularly on the poorest and most vulnerable.
Our study is a major first step in understanding how tropical cyclone exposure impacts many different adverse health outcomes.""
The authors coupled the exposure data with comprehensive hospitalization data among Medicare enrollees.","data, cyclone, adults, school, older, rates, tropical, cyclones, exposure, hospitalizations, health, following, university, study, increased, hospitalization, reveals",cyclone,Acute climatological event (cyclone),"An increase in overall hospitalizations was reported for older adults in the week following exposure to a tropical cyclone, according to a new study by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University's Earth Institute and colleagues at Colorado State University and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.

The researchers used data over 16 years on 70 million Medicare hospitalizations and a comprehensive database of county-level local winds associated with tropical cyclones to examine how tropical cyclone wind exposures affect hospitalizations from 13 mutually exclusive, clinically meaningful causes, along with over 100 sub-causes.

This study is the first comprehensive investigation of the impact of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones on all major causes and sub-causes of hospitalizations. The findings are published in Nature Communications.

Over 16,000 additional hospitalizations were associated with tropical cyclones over a ten-year average exposure. Analyses showed a 14 percent average rise in respiratory diseases in the week after exposure. The day after tropical cyclones with hurricane-force winds respiratory disease hospitalizations doubled.

Also reported was an average 4 percent rise in infectious and parasitic diseases and 9 percent uptick in injuries. Hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) surged 45 percent the week following tropical cyclone exposure compared to weeks without exposure.

This rise in hospitalizations was driven primarily by increases in emergency hospitalizations. The researchers point out that there may have been cases where exposure to the cyclones prevented normal medical care, compelling people to go to the hospital to access services that they might otherwise get outside a hospital setting without the storm.

For example, if those with respiratory issues experienced loss of power--often a result from tropical cyclone winds--they may have turned to hospitals if they needed power for medical equipment that a hospital could furnish.

However, for certain causes, such as certain cancers, the authors also reported decreases in hospitalizations. These decreases were driven by non-emergency hospitalizations, indicating that people possibly cancelled scheduled hospitalizations because of the storm, which may have longer-term impacts on health.

We know that hurricanes and other tropical cyclones have devastating effects on society, particularly on the poorest and most vulnerable. But until now only limited previous studies have calculated their impacts on health outcomes. Current weather trends also indicate that we can expect tropical cyclone exposure to remain a danger to human health and wellbeing, and could cause devastation to many more communities, now and into the future."" Robbie M. Parks, PhD, Study First Author and Post-Doctoral Fellow, Earth Institute, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health

There is no doubt that extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, are a great threat to human health in the U.S. and many other places in the world--now and with climate change in the future. Our study is a major first step in understanding how tropical cyclone exposure impacts many different adverse health outcomes.""

The researchers anticipate that adequate forecasting of tropical cyclones might help, for example, in the planning of setting up shelters to provide electricity and common medications and creating easy ways for vulnerable people with certain chronic conditions to find and use those resources outside of the hospital.

One of the main impediments for research in this field has been the difficulty in readily accessing data for exposure assessment. This research was greatly facilitated by the work of G. Brooke Anderson, PhD, associate professor at Colorado State University, who curated an open-source dataset to easily assess exposure to tropical cyclones for epidemiologic studies.

The authors coupled the exposure data with comprehensive hospitalization data among Medicare enrollees. ""The development of environmental health data research platforms that provide a one-point access to data, like the one we used for this study, can be a very powerful tool allowing research in directions that were not possible before,"" said Francesca Dominici, PhD, professor of biostatistics at the Harvard Chan School and co-author.

""While serious gaps in knowledge remain, we gained valuable insights into the timing of hospitalizations relative to exposure and how cause-specific hospitalizations can be impacted by tropical cyclones,"" said Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, ScD, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School, and senior author. ""These important discoveries will be key for preparedness planning, including hospital and physician preparedness. Our study is just a first step in this process."""

A pedestrian in Hoboken, New Jersey, spied hundreds of earthworms forming a bizarre spiral shape after a rainstorm on March 25

Kyungsoo Yoo, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, told Live Science that while worms will emerge in masse after rain, he'd never seen a cyclone pattern before.

He called the usual shape 'really interesting.'

The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, was walking her dog near the Hudson River on March 25 when she came across the mysterious phenomenon.

She sent pictures of the worm cyclone to Hoboken City Council member Tiffanie Fisher, who shared them on Facebook.

Worms breathe through their skin, so when the soil is saturated with heavy rains they come to the surface to avoid drowning. Earthworms are known to form dense blob-like 'herds' on the surface, but scientists say this mysterious pattern is like nothing they've seen

'Has anyone ever seen anything like this?' Fisher asked 'This is a tornado of worms that were out this morning near Maxwell Park in Hoboken.'

Fisher added that she knew earthworms come out after it rains 'but this is something I've never seen!'

According to the women who observed the 'wormnado,' there were lots of other worms not caught in the cluster.

'They clung to the wall of a nearby building, and dribbled down the curb and into the road,' Live Science reported.

The 'wormnado' formed in Maxwell Park near the Hudson River. Redditors theorized the slithering creatures were disoriented by the electromagnetic field generated by the lampposts in the picture

Theories about the bizarre cluster have cropped up across the Internet, with some blaming biblical plagues and others citing the recent 'Worm Moon,' named by Native Americans to describe the full moon that emerges in early spring, when the ground is warm enough for earthworms to surface.

One redditor speculated the worms were in a 'death spiral,' a phenomenon to occur in army ants when members get separated from the main colony.

The ants lose the pheromone track of their community and begin following each other in an endless loop that often ends with them dying of exhaustion.

The phenomenon has also been observed in caterpillars and koi fish.

Another theory was that the electromagnetic field caused by a nearby lamppost was messing up the worms' navigation.

According to a 2015 National Institute of Health report, some worms can sense these fields, an ability called magnetosensation.

Migrating toward a magnetic field helps C. elegans, a one-millimeter-long transparent roundworm, find food sources, according to biologists at the University of Texas at Austin.

The neurons that control magnetosensation in the worms is also responsible for directional orientation.

Worms breathe through their skin, so when the soil is saturated with heavy rains they come to the surface to avoid drowning.

Earthworms are usually solitary, but they will sometimes form super-dense herds on the surface to share information‚Äîusing touch rather than chemical signals, according to research by biologists at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium.

The areas were already experiencing significant flooding as a result of heavy rainfall since 15 January 2021. Discharge of water from Chicamba dam and the Mavuzi reservoir had also affected residents in districts of Buzi.

Sofala, Manica, Zambezia and Inhambane are the provinces most directly affected by all cyclones, Idai, Kenneth, as well as strong storms Chalane and Eloise. They also have the highest vulnerabilities as a result of slow and interrupted recovery processes due to recurrent disasters. Sofala Province was the most affected and Buzi District was the epicentre of the Cyclone and was heavily affected by post-cyclone flooding, especially for communities along the Pungwe and Buzi Rivers. There were significant damages to homes, water and sanitation infrastructure across the district. Latest reporting states in Sofala 10 accomodation centers are still open with over 4,000 households.

Two years ago, Abel Cossa had the most intense experience of his life. An urgent work call took him to Beira, the capital of Mozambique‚Äôs Sofala province, which was hit by cyclone Idai on 15 March 2019. Abel was on the frontline distributing food with the World Food Programme (WFP) in its wake.

By August of that year, WFP assistance had reached more than 1.8 million people as the organization helped communities pick up the pieces after both Idai and cyclone Kenneth, which struck a month later.

‚ÄúWFP had anticipated the cyclone would create massive destruction, so we were on standby and able to start food assistance to the affected people in the first hour,‚Äù says Abel. ‚ÄúI spent a month in the city of Beira distributing cornmeal and soy in the shelters, to people who‚Äôd lost everything.‚Äù

Idai devasted lives and livelihoods in four provinces and 50 districts. It destroyed homes and flooded 700,000 hectares of crops.

In the first month of emergency assistance, Abel began making daily helicopter trips from the airport to deliver food to districts that were completely isolated after Cyclone Idai struck. ‚ÄúAt first I was scared, but after 30 days of flying every day I even got used to it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWFP‚Äôs logistics and capacity to mobilized ... by air we were able to reach people in the most inaccessible villages. It was a challenge because people who are desperately in need of food and are facing hunger do not want to wait ‚Äî they cannot wait‚Äù.

After the acute emergency phase, Abel started working in the Nhamatanda district (inner Sofala province) providing food assistance in the post-cyclone reconstruction phase. In Nhamatanda district alone, WFP assisted 60,000 affected families with its monthly food basket.

""My great satisfaction is seeing the families rising up again. WFP's food assistance has enabled people to have time and energy to work to rebuild their homes and replant their machambas (subsistence food crops, usually cassava, peanuts, beans, corn and rice) destroyed by the cyclone"".

Breaking the cycle

""When I started working after Idai, I almost cried when I saw people made homeless, because they'd lost everything. Today, it is a pleasure to enter the communities we assisted and see that the houses are rebuilt and life is almost back to normal,"", he says. Abel is involved in a resilience-building programme giving families receive food assistance to work on their small crops or to recover assets in their communities, everything from bridges to schools. ""Families have managed to recover their crops and are no longer dependent on food assistance. Together with partners in the field, we teach techniques for people to produce more with less space.""

Between November 2019 to April 2020, WFP continued assisting 588,135 people in Sofala Province during the reconstruction phase. Then from May to October 2020, WFP continued to support 54,430 people in 28 resettlement centres and an additional 45,000 vulnerable people in communities. Over past two years, funding from donors such as the EU, the UK, the US, Japan, China and Russia, have made it possible to support almost 2.1 million people.

Despite the progress made by the families supported by WFP, almost two years after Idai, two new cyclones, Chalane and Eloise, have hit the same region of Sofala province again. ""Even my home in Nhamatanda lost its roof after Cyclone Chalane struck,"" says Abel. ""660 families were left homeless in Nhamatanda.""

In late December, Cyclone Chalane made landfall in Sofala Province on killing seven people and destroying houses and crops. Weeks later, cyclone Eloise made landfall stronger in the same place. According to the Government of Mozambique, more than 441,000 people were affected, nearly 44,000 were displaced; 745 classrooms were damaged or destroyed, affecting over 83,000 schoolchildren.

‚ÄúAfter providing emergency humanitarian assistance, WFP engages communities in resilience and recovery activities supporting with the creation of assets and training, which contributes to restoring livelihoods‚Äù, says Espinola Caribe head of Beira Sub-Office.

""WFP have designed a long-term recovery plan to help cyclone-affected people to get back on their feet"", says Antonella D'Aprile, WFP Mozambique Country Representative.

Abel sums it up: ""The message is one of hope, food assistance combined with help for people to improve their lives works. We need to continue "".

In these two years after cyclones Idai and Kenneth, the WFP programmes has received the financing of dozens of donors from all over the world, such as Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Croacia, Denmark, European Union, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Japan Kuwait, Luxemburg, Malta, Monaco, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, South Koreia, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, UN CERF, World Bank, Big Heart Foundation, Cartier Philanthropy, Dreyfus Foundation, DSM, Ericsson, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, Herbalife LTD, International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading Foundation, Japan WFP Friends, Latter Day Saints Church, Michael Kors, Mastercard, Mozambique Rovuma Venture, NGO Canadem, Norwegian Refugee Council, Syngenta, Total Mozambique e Corredor Logistico de Nacala."

In 2020, in Bangladesh, COVID-19, cyclone Amphan, and monsoon flooding had collided to create complex crises, which was further deteriorated with capricious climatic behaviour - repeated heavy rain, tidal surge and floods.

Extreme rain left a third of the country inundated---the worst impacts seen in a decade and the longest lasting flooding since 1988. Addition to the reeling economies of the country made by the COVID-19, the climatic disasters cause an estimated loss and damage totalled around 832 million USD (cyclone Amphan at 130 million USD, monsoon flood 702 million USD) which includes impacts on electricity grids, schools, bridges, embankments, roads, drinking water sources, and local administration and community infrastructures.

Within the scope of countries humanitarian response framework, Bangladesh has turned to the international humanitarian community for coordination and funding. The Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) put together two comprehensive humanitarian response plan, totalling the funding requested USD 65 million (USD 25m for cyclone Amphan and USD 40m for monsoon flood). The plans were to support the immediate the needs of food security, nutrition, shelter, WASH, gender-based violence, and child protection of 1.8 million affected people (1.093m flood and 0.7m cyclone affected people - considering double counting through multisectoral reach)) over four months for cyclone Amphan and nine months in flood affected areas.

Despite the humanitarian obligations and heed the call for humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh, humanitarian appeals continue to be underfunded. According to the HCTT‚Äôs Monitoring Dashboards (Cyclone Amphan 6 October 2020 and monsoon flood 30 November 2020) only 40% of the total request (30% of the flood Appeal and 55% cyclone Amphan HRP) has been funded. Reached only 60% of the targeted flood affected people, while the cyclone Amphan target exceed by 8%. Significant shortfalls remain for nutrition, WASH, and integrated GBV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and child protection. Accumulated unmet needs of the affected people remain them living on the margins and are subject to some of the worst impacts.

In these context, the HCTT launched this review, and engage the Humanitarian Leadership Academy - Bangladesh to assess the needs and priorities of affected communities due to extended humanitarian situation, and to identifying response gaps and providing recommendations for humanitarian communities including Govt for: a) taking appropriate actions to address priority humanitarian needs, b) enhance effectiveness of ongoing humanitarian response, and c) smoothen connectedness between emergency response with upcoming recovery effort. Throughout January 2021, the Humanitarian Leadership Academy ‚Äì Bangladesh had conducted this review, directly interacted with 185 people at different level, from affected communities up to senior level decision makers in Govt.

Nearly three million people were evacuated in the days leading up to the storm. Widespread destruction was reported ‚Äì electricity in the region was completely cut off, water sources were polluted, fields destroyed and left non-arable due to salination by seawater, and many houses were badly damaged.

The project was implemented in seven most damaged villages of two blocks in West Bengal, India. The relief response, provided to over 3,500 households, focused primarily on health, food and non-food items as well as hygiene kits.

The following provisions were made available for over 3,500 households:

Provision of aids and appliances, as well as food (dry ration) and non-food items (e.g. hygiene utensils, tarpaulins, blankets) Provision of health & hygiene kits and increasing general awareness among local communities about hand- washing, distance maintaining, and importance of mask wearing etc. Provision of psychosocial support through tele-counselling and home visits Access to medical camps, consisting of 12 medical and paramedical staff Overcoming challenges The stringent national lockdown in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made it difficult to reach affected communities, as everyday life came to a grinding halt. Furthermore, the Amphan Cyclone resulted in widespread destruction and many villages were rendered inaccessible. The monsoon season and heavy rains affected communication networks in the region as well.

However, CBM was able to overcome these challenges in part due to:

Strong coordination with the local panchayats leaders and local administration is critical in times of implementing a large-scale relief-based project. Deep involvement of local community structures, like Youth Clubs, Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and other Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) Local government officials were kept updated of the ongoing work so that special permission could be obtained to continue working during the national lockdown. Beneficiaries of the project were later kept on as volunteers to help identify the neediest. This allowed the project to reach out to those who usually get left behind in relief programs (especially marginalized women & girls and persons with disabilities). In addition, training staff members and volunteers on important topics such as inclusion, child safeguarding as well as prevention of sexual harassment helped ensure that children and vulnerable adults were safe and secure during the entire program."

Strengthening resilience to climate-related hazards is an urgent target of Goal 13 of the United Nations-mandated Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

Stocking emergency supplies or preparing a family evacuation plan can substantially minimise loss and damages from natural hazards. However, the level of preparedness among households is often low even in disaster-prone areas.

Studies have shown that human suffering and other damage do not end with the event itself. Therefore, there is a need to focus on the complicated process of recovery and reconstruction in the months and years following a disaster.

Amid the pandemic

Cyclone Amphan, which caused massive destruction in West Bengal and adjacent areas, intensified rapidly on May 17, 2020 to become a ‚Äòsuper cyclonic storm‚Äô of category 5. It, however, weakened to category 3 before making a landfall on May 20.

The devastating cyclone came at a time when people were struggling with surging cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Lockdowns and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated the response and evacuation process during the disaster.

The challenge was to protect the vulnerable people within the emergency shelters from Cyclone Amphan as well as COVID-19. Most of them were craving for their basic rights of food, shelter and clothing.

Implementation of shelter and toilet rebuilding programme is an immediate need to let them survive.

The process of building resilience requires systematic methods which can be implemented through community interactions to understand the context of their living conditions. Awareness campaigns to understand the purpose of each individual and sensible living facility like eco-friendly shelters and toilets can facilitate the return to normalcy.

Long-term solutions from temporary shelters

Transitional shelters, built for survivors of natural disasters, are unable to hold up against intensifying calamities and the advanced construction technologies are yet to penetrate the population living in acute poverty in West Bengal.

Over the years, use of concrete materials and better technologies in transitional shelters, has made these dwellings stronger against cyclones. The concept, however, is taking time to get widely accepted.

The adaptation of ‚Äòtransitional shelters‚Äô can provide an important insight into cyclone preparedness and resilience and can help develop a community-based approach for disaster management.

Transitional shelter, being an incremental process rather than a multi-phased approach, needs acceptance. Such rapid, post-disaster shelters are made from materials that can be upgraded or re-used in more permanent structures, or can be relocated from temporary sites to permanent locations.

Transitional shelters have proven to be cost-effective over time if implemented correctly and provide good opportunities for scaling-up by using common, local and regional materials. With building transitional shelters comes in meaningful engagement with affected communities /individuals. This ensures design and implementation is context-appropriate and the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups are considered.

However, knowledge of good, safe building practices is inculcated so that houses incorporate disaster risk reduction measures. Pressure should not be taken off permanent housing reconstruction effort. The integration of other sectors or issues such as livelihoods, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and transport, is important for the success of the transition.

There are several ways to boost infrastructure resilience. Hazards can be addressed partially through the widespread deployment of green infrastructure, while preventing the development of grey infrastructure.

Energy resilience can be enhanced through the development of distributed renewable power such as rooftop solar installations. The primary need is avoiding water pollution.

The practice of setting up toilets right beside ponds can be replaced with ecological sanitation toilets. Manure collected from these units can also help the local community in irrigation.

Community engagement for effective recovery

Delivering shelter-recovery programmes is complex and often subject to significant competing interests and obstacles. The needs of women, girls, men and boys and that of different households can vary significantly.

A one-size-fits-all shelter design has limited flexibility to meet these needs. Governments and non-governmental organisations should greatly strengthen their approaches to community engagement in shelter projects, with the aim to improve community ownership of projects and individual ownership of shelters.

Future programmes should aim to empower people to take charge of their own shelter recovery, including giving them meaningful control and choices over shelter design and construction, hence leading to improved outcomes overall.

To do so, developing a communal understanding of the different risks disaster-affected people face and ensuring they have the knowledge to make choices about these risks is required. This will require strong community engagement and technical support capacity.

Any future climate adaptation strategy needs to account for material needs of the most vulnerable communities, prioritising the building of a social safety net that will enable them to resume their livelihoods and continue to live with dignity.

Moreover, among the various stakeholders that build and carry community resilience are government, grassroots organisations and volunteer networks. These stakeholders are those who understand the local community and show up in solidarity at the hour of need, as disasters around the world have shown time and again.

by Earth Institute | March 9, 2021

A new study documents a rise in hospitalizations of older U.S. adults rise in the week following exposure to a tropical cyclone. The study is the first comprehensive investigation of the impact of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones on all causes of hospitalizations. The findings were published this week in the journal Nature Communications.

The researchers used data on 70 million Medicare hospitalizations over 16 years, and a comprehensive database of county-level winds associated with tropical cyclones to examine how tropical cyclone wind exposures affect hospitalizations from 13 mutually exclusive causes, along with more than 100 sub-causes.

The work was carried out by researchers at Columbia University‚Äôs Earth Institute, Columbia‚Äôs Mailman School of Public Health, Colorado State University and Harvard University‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Over 16,000 additional hospitalizations were associated with tropical cyclones over a 10-year average exposure. Analyses showed that the day after tropical cyclones with hurricane-force winds struck, respiratory disease hospitalizations doubled. Hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease surged 45 percent in the week following. Overall, there was a 14 percent average rise in respiratory diseases in the week after exposure. Also reported was an average 4 percent uptick in infectious and parasitic diseases, and a 9 percent rise in injuries.

This rises were driven primarily by increases in emergency hospitalizations. But the researchers point out that there may have been cases where exposure to the cyclones prevented normal medical care, compelling people to go to the hospital to access services that they might otherwise get outside a hospital. For example, if those with respiratory issues experienced loss of power‚Äîoften a result of high winds‚Äîthey may have turned to hospitals if they needed power for medical equipment that a hospital could furnish.

For some causes, such as certain cancers, the authors reported decreases in hospitalizations. These decreases were driven by non-emergency hospitalizations, indicating that people possibly cancelled scheduled hospitalizations because of a storm. Such cancellations could have longer-term impacts on health, say the researchers.

‚ÄúWe know that hurricanes and other tropical cyclones have devastating effects on society, particularly on the poorest and most vulnerable,‚Äù said Robbie M. Parks, an Earth Institute postdoctoral fellow at the Mailman School of Public Health and first author. ‚ÄúBut until now only limited previous studies have calculated their impacts on health outcomes.‚Äù Parks said that current weather trends and the ongoing effects of climate change suggest that tropical cyclones are a continuing, and possibly increasing threat. ‚ÄúOur study is a major first step in understanding how tropical cyclone exposure impacts many different adverse health outcomes,‚Äù he said.

The researchers anticipate that adequate forecasting of tropical cyclones might help in plans to set up shelters to provide electricity and common medications, and create easier ways for vulnerable people with certain chronic conditions to find and use those resources outside of the hospital.

The study was facilitated by G. Brooke Anderson of Colorado State University, who curated an open-source data set that allows researchers to easily assess exposure to tropical cyclones for epidemiological studies. The authors coupled the exposure data with comprehensive hospitalization data among Medicare enrollees.

‚ÄúWhile serious gaps in knowledge remain, we gained valuable insights into the timing of hospitalizations relative to exposure and how cause-specific hospitalizations can be impacted by tropical cyclones,‚Äù said Mailman researcher Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, the study‚Äôs senior author. ‚ÄúThese important discoveries will be key for preparedness planning, including hospital and physician preparedness. Our study is just a first step in this process.‚Äù
