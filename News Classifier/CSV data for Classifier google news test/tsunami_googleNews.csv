Hundreds more were injured when the 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the early hours, triggering panic among the terrified residents of the island, which was hit by a huge quake and tsunami two and a half years ago that killed thousands.

""The latest information we have is that 26 people are dead... in Mamuju city,"" said Ali Rahman, head of the local disaster mitigation agency, adding ""that number could grow"".

""Many of the dead are buried under rubble,"" he said.

Separately, the national disaster agency said at least eight people had died in an area south of Mamuju, a city of some 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, bringing the total death toll to 34.

Rescuers were searching for more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath the rubble of the levelled Mamuju hospital.

""The hospital is flattened -- it collapsed,"" said Arianto from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, who goes by one name.

""There are patients and hospital employees trapped under the rubble and we're now trying to reach them,"" he added, without giving a specific figure.

Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight trapped under the rubble of their destroyed home, he added.

The country's search-and-rescue agency said at least one hotel had partially collapsed after the quake struck at 2:18 am local time Friday (1818 GMT Thursday), while the regional governor's office also suffered extensive damage.

A Mamuju resident said damage across the city was severe.

""Roads are cracked and many buildings collapsed,"" said 28-year-old Hendra, who also goes by one name.

""The quake was very strong... I woke up and ran away with my wife.""

'Tsunami potential'

Images from the scene showed residents fleeing the seaside city in cars and motorbikes as they drove past corrugated metal roofs and other building debris scattered on the roadside.

The meteorological agency warned residents that the area could be hit by strong aftershocks and to avoid the beachfront in case of a tsunami.

""The aftershocks could be as strong, or stronger, than this morning's quake,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, chief of the meteorological agency.

""There is potential for a tsunami from subsequent aftershocks... Don't wait for a tsunami first because they can happen very quickly,"" she added.

The local airport in Mamuju had also been damaged, authorities said.

The quake's epicentre was 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Mamuju and it had a relatively shallow depth of 18 kilometres, the United States Geological Survey said.

Images supplied by the search-and-rescue agency showed rescue workers checking on two sisters who were trapped under rubble. It was not clear where they were trapped.

Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.

In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.

On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.

Thousands of frightened residents fled their homes for higher ground when the magnitude 6.2-quake struck 6 km (4 miles) northeast of the town of Majene, at a depth of just 10 km, shortly before 1.30 a.m.

The quake and aftershocks damaged more than 300 homes and two hotels, as well as flattening a hospital and the office of a regional governor, where authorities told Reuters several people have been trapped under the rubble.

“Praise be to God, for now OK, but we just felt another aftershock,” said Sukri Efendy, a 26-year-old resident of the area.

As many as 42 people have been killed, mostly in Mamuju and the rest in the neighbouring district of Majene, the country’s national disaster mitigation agency said in a situation report on Friday evening. More than 820 people were injured, it said.

The heightened seismic activity set off three landslides, severed electricity supplies, and damaged bridges linking to regional hubs, such as the city of Makassar. Heavy rain was also worsening conditions for those seeking shelter.

No tsunami warning was issued but the head of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), Dwikorita Karnawati, told a news conference that aftershocks could follow, with a possibility that another powerful quake could trigger a tsunami.

There had been at least 26 aftershocks, she said, with Friday’s quake preceded by a quake of 5.9 magnitude the previous day.

Mamuju resident Muhammad Ansari Iriyanto, 31, told Reuters that everyone panicked and sought refuge in the nearby hills and mountains.

“Mamuju is now empty, everyone went to the mountains,” he said. “Lots of buildings collapsed and people are afraid of a tsunami.”

Another resident Syahir Muhammad said: “It’s raining and we need help.”

Videos shared on social media showed residents fleeing to higher ground on motorcycles, and a young girl trapped under rubble as people tried to shift debris with their hands. Rescue workers used cutting and lifting equipment to free survivors and find the dead.

President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and authorities to step up search efforts.

Emerging workers are now trying to restoring telecoms and bridge links and ensure the delivery of tents, food and medical supplies, said West Sulawesi provincial government spokesman Safaruddin.

About 15,000 people have fled their homes since the quake, the disaster agency has said, with the coronavirus pandemic likely to complicate the distribution of aid.

“It is certainly one of the most challenging, this (disaster) was one of our fears and now we are putting all of that planning and protocols into place,” said Jan Gelfand, head of the International Federation of Red Cross in Indonesia.

Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes.

In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.

A 9.1-magnitude quake off the north of Sumatra island triggered a tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004 that lashed coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other nations, killing more than 230,000 people.

The interior ministry said on Twitter that a tremor of magnitude 7.1 struck at 8.36 pm local time, 216 km northeast of the O’Higgins Chilean scientific base, and called for the coastal regions of Antarctica to be evacuated because of a tsunami risk.

The ministry also sent a message to mobile phones around the country urging people to abandon coastal areas, though the ministry later said it was sent in error.

“We want to provide peace of mind to the population, tell them that it is not necessary to evacuate the entire national territory, only the Antarctic base,” Miguel Ortiz of the ministry’s National Emergency Office told a news conference.

He said the agency regretted the inconvenience caused by its messages, which he blamed on a technical error.

The tsunami warning for Antarctica was later lifted.

People in coastal cities including La Serena, to the north of Santiago, and Valparaíso, started to leave areas close to the coast after the warning until reports started appearing that it was a false alarm.

But as Chileans were reacting to the warning, a second tremor, of magnitude 5.6, struck the Chile-Argentina border region, at 9.07 pm, the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said, at a depth of 133 km and 30km east of Santiago.

No damage was reported from either quake.

The second one was close to Codelco’s Andina and Teniente copper mines and Anglo American PLC’s Los Bronces.

The Chilean mining regulator Sernageomin said that workers, mining operations and facilities had reported no problems after the quake.

Sernageomin said that following the first quake, 80 people were evacuated from Chile’s main base in the Antarctic, the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base on Fildes Peninsula west of King George Island, and 55 more from three other bases, along with five foreign bases.

The army said no damage was reported at the Antarctic base.

Chile is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Just off the coast, the Nazca tectonic plate plunges beneath the South American plate, pushing the towering Andes cordillera to ever-higher altitudes.

In 2017, one million people were evacuated from their homes after an 8.3-magnitude earthquake.

LONDON (AP) — For nine months, Gordon Bonner has been in the “hinterlands of despair and desolation” after losing his wife of 63 years to the coronavirus pandemic that has now taken the lives of more than 100,000 people in the United Kingdom.

Only recently did Bonner think he might be able to move on — after sensing the spirit of his wife, Muriel, near him on what would have been her 84th birthday.

“I suddenly understood I had to change my attitude, that memories are not shackles, they are garlands and one should wear them like garlands around your shoulders and use them to communicate between the quick and the dead,” the retired Army major said in an interview from his home in the northern city of Leeds. “Grief is the price we pay for love.”

Bonner, 86, is just one of many hundreds of thousands of Britons toiling with grief because of the pandemic. With more than 2 million dead worldwide, people the world over are mourning loved ones, but the U.K.’s toll weighs particularly heavily: It is the smallest nation to pass the 100,000 mark.

While Wuhan, Bergamo or New York City may be more associated with the pandemic, the U.K. has one of the the highest death tolls relative to its population. For comparison, the United States, with five times Britain’s population, has four times the number of deaths. Experts say virus tallies, in general, are undercounts due to limited testing and missed cases, especially early in the pandemic.

Alongside excess deaths comes excess grief, made even more acute by the social distancing measures in place to slow the virus’s spread.

“There’s going to be a tsunami of grief and mental health issues this year, next year, ongoing, due to the complications, because of course people haven’t been able to have the usual rituals,” said Linda Magistris, founder of the Good Grief Trust , which brings bereavement services in the U.K. together under one umbrella.

Bonner understands the need for restrictions but that hasn’t made it any easier.

Six weeks after he was prevented from going to Muriel’s care home because of lockdown restrictions and 10 days after she was diagnosed with COVID-19, Bonner was summoned to the hospital and, “dressed like a spaceman,” he bore witness to his wife’s final agonizing moments.

“She was working so hard to draw breath, her lips were pursed as if she was sucking on a straw,” he said. “I can see her face now with her lips in that position and it was devastating and it knocked me sideways.”

That was the last time he saw Muriel, and that image haunts him. And in what he termed a “wicked twist in the tale,” Bonner was not offered the chance to replace that memory as his wife’s body was deemed a “reservoir of active coronavirus.” He wasn’t even able to have her dressed the way he wanted for her cremation. Hugs with friends and family — well, they’re not advised.

Those rituals help people cope, a task made harder now because there’s no escape from the scale of death in the U.K. — beyond the annual average of around 600,000 — from the regular sound of ambulance sirens to the alarming headlines on news bulletins.

“The backdrop of death, of grief, around creates quite a caustic context,” said Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse , a leading charity for bereaved people.

Many left behind are unsure where to seek help, partly because they are navigating the grieving process at a time when local health services are not operating as normal.

Bereavement charities have stepped in, tailoring support groups online, that may appeal to those who may otherwise have been reluctant to search out help in the pre-COVID-19 world.

But resources are stretched, especially when the country is regularly recording over 1,000 deaths a day. The government is being urged to provide extra funding to bolster helplines, counseling services and other community support programs.

“It’s really important we don’t pathologize grief as indicative of mental health difficulties, but equally a huge proportion of people will need support,” said Dr. Charley Baker, associate professor of mental health at the University of Nottingham.

Many won’t need any or only minimal outside support. But there is a concern that some of the grief is pent up: that people may be be subconsciously shielding themselves from its full impact, and they may end up being hit hard as the pandemic comes under control.

“I think it will be strange because it will be a really positive thing when things can hopefully get back to some degree of normality, but I think that would also be a very difficult moment because we’ve all been a bit frozen in time,” said Jo Goodman, who lost her 72-year-old father Stuart last April, just days after he tested positive for the virus.

A couple of months after her father died, Goodman, 32, co-founded the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group to pressure the government to back a public inquiry into how the pandemic was handled last spring.

“We can’t normalize the fact that hundreds upon hundreds of people are dying everyday and knowing what their families are going through,” Goodman said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said an inquiry will take place — but only after the crisis is over. But already critics are arguing that the government has repeated the mistakes it made in the spring in the current resurgence , such as locking down the country too late. The U.K. is also contending with a new, more contagious variant that may carry a higher risk of death than the original strain .

Bonner, meanwhile, is hoping that the country will take the time to properly mourn and is considering sending a letter to Johnson, who has yet to back a national commemoration for virus victims, to suggest a “a simultaneous remembrance service so those of us who have lost people to COVID can go somewhere to seek some solace.”

Ireland’s 14-day infection rate has quadrupled in the past 10 days to 819 cases per 100,000, fueled by a new more transmissible COVID-19 variant first identified in Britain and the relaxation of restrictions ahead of Christmas.

Officials reported a record high of 7,836 cases on Wednesday.

“Already exhausted healthcare workers now face a tsunami of infection even greater than the first wave,” Prime Minister Micheal Martin told a news conference announcing the new measures.

“In addition we have a more infectious strain of the virus in our midst... which can rapidly lead to growth well beyond previous worst case scenarios.”

A six-week lockdown in October and November reduced Ireland’s infection rate to the lowest in the European Union. But the reopening of restaurants and retail in December and a lifting of a ban on household visits for Christmas then helped give it the EU’s fastest infection growth rate.

In a bid to regain control, the government on Wednesday ordered the closure of most schools and construction sites for at least three weeks, tightening a lockdown that has already closed most hospitality and retail outlets and banned household visits.

Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said bars and restaurants in Ireland should be prepared for the fact that closure until the end of March was now likely as the country waits for the delivery of enough vaccine to control the virus.

“If I was running a business now, I would be thinking that it’s a probability that I’ll be closed until the end of March,” Varadkar said, adding that state support for workers would last at least until then.

The number of patients in Irish hospitals with COVID-19 hit an all-time high of 921 on Wednesday up from a mid-April peak of 881. COVID-19 hospital admissions are rising by around 10% a day, health officials said.

The head of the country’s health service Paul Reid earlier this week said the total in hospitals could hit 2,500 this month if infection growth rates are not curbed.

“Hospitals and ICUs (intensive care units) not overwhelmed in the first wave are at serious risk of being so later this month,” Varadkar said.

“We are facing into what is going to be a really dark January,” he added."

STATELINE, Nev. (AP) — The past year was such a wild ride that even the thought of a tsunami at Lake Tahoe probably doesn't sound out of reason.

Several thousand years ago, according to Richard Schweickert, a retired University of Nevada, Reno geology professor, the lake experienced just such an event.

While a specific date is hard to pinpoint, it is estimated that a tsunami struck after an earthquake in the basin about 10,000 to 20,000 years ago.

Schweickert has spent most of his career working in the Sierra Nevada and has been collecting evidence about tsunamis in Lake Tahoe.

In 1999, he and geologist Mary Lahren, a University of Nevada professor emeritus, mapped land near Eagle Rock close to Homewood.

A year earlier, Jim Gardner at the United States Geological Survey released a map of earthquake faults. Jim Moore of the USGS began a collaboration with Schweickert in 2005.

The map showed a landslide that occurred at McKinney Bay along with several other tsunami indicators.

While Schweickert and other researchers were collecting data on land, Christopher Kitts, an associated mechanical engineering professor at Santa Clara University and director of its Robotics Systems Laboratory, brought students and equipment to Lake Tahoe about 13 years ago to take a closer look at what lies beneath the surface.

""We began to realize there is underwater evidence that could also be attributed to the tsunami,"" Schweickert told the Tahoe Daily Tribune .

In 2005, a team including Winnie Kortemeier from Western Nevada College, Kitts, Moore, Lahren and Schweickert researched the Tahoe City Shelf where they discovered ""boulder ridges"" that had never been described in a lake before.

Similar to the small ripples you see on the beach when you walk along the shore, massive ridges formed due to the volume and force of gigantic waves.

Some found in four locations just off the west shore of the northwest side of the lake are perfectly aligned ""boulder ridges,"" as tall as 6.5 feet (2 meters) and as long as 6,562 feet (2000 meters).

A person on a boat on a relatively calm day can see these boulder ridges at a depth of about 15-30 feet (4.6-9.1 meters).

Schweickert said theory of ""mega ripples"" would imply ""mega waves.""

Large sand waves can also be found at 15 areas around the lake. They were caused by the flow of large volumes of water into the lake from onshore, some reaching almost 10 feet (3 meters) high.

The research team spent more than 40 days on the lake using robotics to take a deeper look and interpret underwater features.

They found massive vertical canyons, some as deep as 200 feet (61 meters), carved into the sidewall such as in Rubicon Point.

""A mass amount of water had to have been thrown out onto the shores that poured back in carving the sidewalls,"" said Schweickert. ""Extremely large volumes of water were pouring into the sides of the lake.""

The largest number of deep sidewall canyons is near Tahoe Keys in South Lake Tahoe.

""The landslide generated such large waves that they flooded low areas around the sides of the lake and produced these features,"" Schweickert said. ""Lake Tahoe is the only lake we are aware of that has features like this, out of anywhere else in the world that has been documented.""

This earthquake not only shook the ground in Tahoe but caused approximately 3.5 cubic miles (5.6 cubic kilometers) of surrounding earth to slide 1,640 feet (500 meters) into the lake. The resulting splash caused waves about 300 feet (91.4 meters) high and lowered the lake's water level by 33 feet (10 meters) for a period of time.

Enormous waves may have reached the upper Truckee River Canyon before pouring back into the lake. Some countryside areas were flattened. Sediment and glacial deposits swept into the lake.

The most affected areas were the Glenbrook and Zephyr Cove areas and Stateline to Baldwin Beach in South Lake Tahoe.

To understand the impact, Schweickert has been researching active faults around the basin. He co-authored with Will Barber an ebook, ""Journeys Across Nevada's Wild Lands,"" that offers a geological history tour and includes portions of the south and east sides of Lake Tahoe.

While evidence of several faults have been around since the 1960s, Schweickert mapped one called the North Tahoe fault that runs northeast from the lake through Incline Village and over Mount Rose to Reno.

The West Tahoe Dollar Point fault runs north-south along the West Shore.

A third fault, called the Tahoe Sierra, runs through the mountains just west of the lake.

""Major earthquakes on the West Shore can produce a series of potential hazards,"" Schweickert said.

With active faults and relatively ""weak"" sediment in some areas of the lake, he said there is a possibility of another tsunami occurring in Lake Tahoe again.

""There is no way to predict if it's 20,000 or 20 years from now,"" he said.

But he said that for people living in the basin, the hazard of forest fires is far greater.

13,2021-01-18 00:00:00,Tsunami-hit area struggles to find foreign workers in pandemic,https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14134925,"And the drop was even sharper in coastal areas, such as Kesennuma, increasing the communities’ dependence on foreign workers.
About 70 of the around 300 employees at Kawamura, a seafood processing company based in the Sanriku coastal region, are foreign technical trainees.
The number of foreign technical trainees in Japan was about 400,000 as of June 2020.
In South Korea, the central government handles the hiring process of foreign workers, eliminating the need for brokers.
“The central government also treats foreign workers as nothing but a supplementary labor force,” Saito said.","pandemic, foreign, tsunamihit, japan, central, south, technical, miyagi, area, yen, struggles, trainees, workers, company",tsunami,geophysical event,"KESENNUMA, Miyagi Prefecture--Wataru Sugawara has done his part to make this city attractive to technical trainees from Indonesia, a population segment deemed vital for Kesennuma’s continuing efforts to revive from the 2011 tsunami disaster.

Sugawara, the 46-year-old president of civil engineering company Sugawara Kogyo, opened an Islamic house of worship in summer 2019 and established a next-door restaurant that does not serve pork.

Local residents are also hosting Japanese language classes twice a month.

But the number of trainees is still falling short of levels needed to prop up the depleted work forces in the city’s fishery and seafood processing industries.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has clearly affected the entry of technical trainees from overseas, but other factors are also behind the decline, including restrictions in the trainee program and the realization of such workers that there may be better opportunities in other countries.

That is bad news for places like Kesennuma, a city with a population of about 60,000, that have increasingly depended on foreign workers in terms of labor, local economy and vitality since the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami destroyed their communities in March 2011.

Sugawara also said that more people have reached middle-class status in Indonesia, which means the number of Indonesians coming to Japan to work has declined.

“Still, I want to make our town be chosen by them,” Sugawara said about opening the mosque.

The language classes in the city have proved popular among trainees.

“Kanji is difficult, but it is fun to remember them,” said a 22-year-old female trainee from Indonesia who has lived in Japan for three years.

The Miyagi prefectural government has also discussed a plan to open a Japanese language school to bring more interns to the area.

Miyagi Governor Yoshihiro Murai said the dwindling population is the biggest challenge for the coastal areas still recovering from the 2011 disaster.

“Having a migration of new people is very important,” Murai said.

With the falling birthrate and the graying of society, the nationwide working-age population, or those aged between 15 and 64, decreased by 6 percent over the past decade.

But in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, the prefectures hardest hit by the quake and tsunami, the decrease was by 11 percent.

And the drop was even sharper in coastal areas, such as Kesennuma, increasing the communities’ dependence on foreign workers.

About 70 of the around 300 employees at Kawamura, a seafood processing company based in the Sanriku coastal region, are foreign technical trainees.

The company in 2018 established a joint venture in Indonesia as a place of employment for technical trainees who complete the program in Japan. One has already landed a job at the joint venture, the company said.

However, the plan has been hindered by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The number of foreign technical trainees in Japan was about 400,000 as of June 2020. In summer that year, Kawamura was expected to welcome 40 technical trainees, but 18 have yet to arrive in Japan.

With the harvest season for “wakame” seaweed about to start, the company is facing an uphill struggle to secure enough manpower.

Many companies and communities have faced a similar challenge.

Employers and experts have pointed out that rules in the central government’s technical trainee program have further complicated matters.

Under the program, foreign nationals can stay in Japan for up to five years under the name of “learning skills.”

The government has added a “special skill” category for visas in the revised Immigration Control Law. But the targeted trainees are not allowed to stay for more than five years in total, and they cannot bring their families to Japan.

“If we lose foreigners, we lose the community,” Kenju Kawamura, the 71-year-old president of Kawamura, said.

He is urging the central government to review the system and allow foreign technical trainees to settle in Japan.

And unfortunately for Japan, the competition to secure migrant labor has intensified.

A 20-year-old Vietnamese woman who works at a company in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, said, “I want to go to South Korea next.”

Her net monthly salary is about 120,000 yen ($1,160). She keeps 20,000 yen for food and other living expenses and sends the rest to her family in Vietnam. She also has to pay back 1 million yen that she borrowed to come to Japan.

She said she has been looking for a better deal in neighboring countries.

The minimum hourly wage in South Korea is equivalent to about 820 yen. Japan’s minimum wage varies by prefecture. It is 825 yen an hour in Miyagi Prefecture and 793 yen in Iwate Prefecture.

In some prefectures in the Sanin, Shikoku and Kyushu regions, the rate is between 790 yen and 799 yen.

In South Korea, the central government handles the hiring process of foreign workers, eliminating the need for brokers.

The South Korean system is more appealing because foreign technical trainees in Japan have had to pay initial costs to brokers, some interns said.

Yoshihisa Saito, an associate professor of labor law at Kobe University, said Japan’s minimum wage is low compared with rates among other advanced nations.

“The central government also treats foreign workers as nothing but a supplementary labor force,” Saito said. “If this continues, foreigners will soon stop choosing Japan as a place to work.”

Saito is calling on the central government to allow foreign technical trainees to bring their families here and provide a wider range of visas “to create a society where they can live with Japanese and support each other.”"

A public elementary school building in northeastern Japan where more than 80 pupils and teachers lost their lives in the 2011 tsunami is scheduled to open possibly in April as a memorial to those impacted by the disaster.

Okawa Elementary School in Miyagi Prefecture, located about 4 kilometers from the coast, will have an area where visitors can pray for the victims as well as exhibits to remember the calamity that beset the area on March 11, 2011.

The city government of Ishinomaki decided in March 2016 to preserve the school. But opinions are divided among residents, with some bereaved families saying they cannot bear the sight of the building.

Many of the 108 pupils of the school were instructed by teachers to remain in the schoolyard for about 50 minutes after the magnitude 9 earthquake struck just off the coast of northeastern Japan.

Huge tsunami reached the school just after they started evacuating to a nearby hill, killing 70 pupils, and 10 teachers and officials. Four students remain unaccounted for.

""I want people around the country to know about what happened under school supervision at Okawa elementary,"" said Sonomi Sato, 24, who lost her sister at the school.

In March 2014, the families of 23 students filed a damages suit against the prefectural and city governments, arguing the school should have implemented better anti-tsunami measures.

The school sat approximately 1.5 meters above sea level near a river. The city's hazard map at the time did not designate the school as being in an area that could potentially be hit by a tsunami.

A Japanese high court acknowledged the deaths could have been prevented if the city and prefecture had updated a contingency plan and ordered the governments to pay about 1.43 billion yen ($13.7 million). The ruling was finalized in 2019 after the governments' appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court.

In the 10 years since the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, numerous memorials and relics have been preserved in the hardest-hit areas to ensure the lessons learned will be passed down to future generations. However, efforts to create such monuments have not always been trouble-free.

On Monday, demolition work began on a two-story building that had a 28-meter-long sightseeing boat swept onto its roof following the tsunami in Otsuchi, Iwate Prefecture.

The boat, estimated to be around 200 tons at the time of the disaster, was taken down in May 2011 and scrapped. The town had hoped to recreate the incident by placing a boat on top of the building, used as a guest house at the time, as a memorial.

However, the town was unable to gather enough funds, only receiving 1 percent of its 450 million yen goal, and decided to give up on the plan last year.

Members of the town assembly said at the time that enough support was not gathered due to a lack of publicity for the effort."

Her daughter was scared—something was happening to the water, she said. The tide had pulled far from the shore of their coastal village, and some of the other residents were running for higher ground. Suddenly, the line went dead.

The summer’s midnight sun hung high above Uummannaq, an island community nearly 600 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle on Greenland’s west coast, when a teacher working at a local child care received a phone call.

Tipping Point covers environmental justice stories about and, where possible, written by people in the communities experiencing the stark reality of our changing planet.

Of the 43 people in Nuugaatsiaq at the time of the tsunami, four were killed, and the rest relocated to neighbouring Uummannaq.

Nervous to take her sick child out in the cold, the young woman decided to stay indoors while the rest of the community ran up to the hills. She and her family were killed when the wave hit.

But the woman who had called her mom was not among them. The day before the tsunami struck, she had telephoned the hospital in Uummannaq, concerned her baby was running a fever. She asked if they could arrange a helicopter for her, but without the necessary funding, the hospital denied the request.

That night in June 2017, Nuugaatsiaq was devastated by a mega-tsunami, the waves triggered by a massive landslide nearly 30 kilometres across the fjord. Though the waves had somewhat dissipated by the time they reached Nuugaatsiaq, their effect on the small fishing village was still devastating. Shaky cellphone footage that emerged in the days and weeks following show homes and buildings lifted from their foundations and pushed inland, before being sucked out into the frozen waters; sled-dogs hastily loosened from the stakes to which they’re chained make a desperate run before being swept up; and pyjama-clad residents hurry for the safety of higher ground.

More than three years later, those displaced by the tsunami are still unable to return home. Sections of the rock face are unstable and liable to collapse again, a symptom of the warming climate across the region.

“We are people of the ice,” said Marna Møller on a day in March, as her husband Mikkel brought over mugs of coffee. “In our fjord we have a massive glacier front, so we are used to ice calving in our fjord. But what happened then was something entirely different; these waves were of a massive scale.”

Researchers who’ve studied the 2017 mega-tsunami say that while events like it are still uncommon, the effects of global warming will result in more landslides and a drastic rise in sea levels, both in Greenland and elsewhere, particularly in already thawing Arctic and alpine environments. Those living directly in their path, however, are already experiencing the trauma, both individually and communally.

In August, Greenland’s ice sheet passed a critical point of no return; Ohio State University researchers determined snowfall that replenishes the ice will no longer be able to keep up with the volume it’s losing. In September, a section of ice measuring nearly 110 square kilometres broke from the Arctic’s largest remaining ice shelf in northeast Greenland, due to warming waters. In a December report from the University of Liege, new climate models are predicting a 60 percent greater melting of Greenland’s ice sheet than had previously been forecast.

The initial run-up—how high the water reaches up the shoreline—measured close to 90 metres in parts along the slope from which 45 million cubic metres of earth tumbled into the waters below. In comparison, the run-up that precipitated the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster measured 40 metres.

“When the waves started coming, we fled to the mountains. We had no time to grab anything, no phones, and no clothes,” Marna said, pointing to a painting of Nuugaatsiaq on the wall behind her. “Houses were quickly being swept away from the village.”

Marna and her family were in Nuugaatsiaq when the tsunami struck. From their home they watched as the water took on a strange effect, convulsing and receding sharply. Fishing boats which only moments earlier had idled listlessly in the water rocked and swayed as they were pulled back along their ropes. As people left their homes and walked towards the shore, some filming on their phones, the water began to rush back in.

“We believe the rockslide happened because of the climate changing,” said Marna. “The rock is very muddy up there (on the mountains) and with the warmer climate it affects the conditions up there.”

For nearly six hours, Marna said, she and the others waited at the base of the mountain, too afraid to return to their village even after the waves had ceased.

For Dr. Annie Kerouedan, the memories of the tsunami still linger. A French national, Kerouedan has lived in Greenland for over a decade, and since 2006 was chief physician at the hospital in Uummannaq, the primary medical hub in the region.

Fritz says that this destabilizing thawing is an issue for the entire Arctic and high alpine environments globally. “All the freezing and thawing, and then the de-glaciation, retreat of glaciers and so forth, the melting of permafrost: all of these things are factors that will result in more likelihood of landslides of all scales.”

As the Arctic thaws and glaciers begin to recede, the permafrost holding the earth together melts, and landscapes become more unstable. While freezing and thawing have always occurred, the ongoing loss of permafrost is creating increased instability in areas that were once stable.

In July 2017, Fritz and a team of researchers travelled to Greenland to collect data following the landslide and tsunami to determine the causes. Through a National Science Foundation grant, the team surveyed the remote location of the landslide, and reconstructed the events with aerial photography. Generally speaking, Fritz said, climate change is responsible for a number of factors behind landslides like the one in Greenland.

“It’s not a new phenomenon,” said Hermann Fritz, a professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology, “but obviously freezing and thawing is one of the main mechanisms to really trigger landslides.”

In the days following the tsunami, financial support for those displaced poured in from across Greenland and beyond. The Danish military helped residents retrieve what belongings they could, including any dogs that had managed to survive.

The fourth individual who died that day, an older man, had a consultation at the hospital scheduled for the following week for his bad leg. Unable to outrun the waves, he never reached the top of the hill where the others had found safety.

“All the time I’ve been thinking,” said Kerouedan, “if we had said, ‘OK, we’ll send the helicopter and you’ll come to Uummannaq,’ they wouldn’t have been there.”

While they were able to evacuate 39 residents safely, it’s the memories of those they couldn’t save that stick with her most, like the young mother.

She and her team coordinated the evacuation efforts following the tsunami and treated the injured while also worrying about the fate of their own friends and family in the area of the disaster.

Following their evacuation to Uummannaq, residents expected to go home once they got word from the government that it was safe to do so. Days later, Marna and others were invited to a meeting where they were told that an area around the landslide was still unstable. Though residents of Niaqornat, a settlement about 90 kilometres away from Nuugaatsiaq, could go home, the risk of a future slide made it impossible for Marna and her family to return.

Through a lottery selection, the Møllers were placed in a house near the center of Uummannaq, though others from Nuugaatsiaq live further away in a new development. Though they’re happy to live where they do, Marna says their new home is un-insulated in parts, and was missing some amenities. “We didn’t even have water in the beginning,” she said.

Despite initial promises of long-term support, many from Nuugaatsiaq feel let down by the government, who they say never delivered promised compensation for property and expenses. The Møllers had paid out of pocket for everything except the house, including renting a property in town until a permanent home was provided, as well as new furnishings in lieu of what they had to leave behind.

“It’s still difficult for her: she cannot speak to her parents, and she wanted to die,” said Kerouedan.

The girl was picked up from a community called Saattut, and was one of those displaced from Nuugaatsiaq. On her way to the hospital, she told a nurse that she still thinks of the tsunami.

“A young girl had tried to cut herself,” she said, gesturing to her arm. “It was big—really big.”

Kerouedan, who left her position at the hospital in Uummannaq in February following restructuring by the regional health authority, now splits her time between the Arctic and France. The morning before her final shift, she was called down to the hospital to treat a patient from one of the other settlements.

Ultimately, it has been the fragmenting of their once tight-knit community that the family has found most challenging. “Our youngest daughter, who was 12 years old at the time, also experienced a lot of change,” said Marna. “She was bullied in school here for being a ‘refugee.’”

While some from Nuugaatsiaq have relatives in town that they can rely on, the Møllers’ connections are spread out among the villages across the fjord. As their former community grows more separated, Mikkel noted it was that same sense of community which helped them initially cope with the trauma.

“Grieving together and carrying the sorrow as a community was very important,” Mikkel said. “I look back and I feel so grateful for what we had in Nuugaatsiaq; it’s brought a lot of tears, but also joy in reminiscing of the life we had.”

Mikkel still smokes fish near his former home. And while there have been rumours in the past of the government reopening the settlement, he says the community must move forward. “The incident is something we eventually need to accept,” said Mikkel. “We didn’t choose to experience it, (nor) did we want to move here and become locals in Uummannaq. We need to accept that now.”

“Ajorpoq, Ajuuvippoq,” said Marna, shaking her head, which roughly translates to “it's bad, very bad” in Greenlandic. “It’s terrible. We never even imagined having to leave Nuugaatsiaq before.”

Ten years ago,turbulent floodwaters swirled angrily into the CBD after 160 millimetres of rain fell in 36 hours on top of a month’s record rainfall, turning the normally calm West and East creeks into a frothing, angry river. That river, at the top of the Great Dividing Range, tragically led to the deaths of two people – mother and son Donna and Jordan Rice – after their car stalled in the rising water. Across the state, 33 people died and three remain missing from the January 2011 floods, which affected 78 per cent of Queensland and caused $2.38 billion in damages.

To create the series designed to mark the 10-year anniversary of the disaster, NHK amassed hundreds of hours of film shot by NHK camera crews as well as mobile phone and other footage captured by citizens who were on scene during and after the earthquake and tsunami. NHK edited and wove the footage together in chronological order to create this compelling series—and cautionary tale—that captures the magnitude and emotions of the unprecedented mega-disaster.

Episode 1 of the series, “The First 3 Days,” tells the story of the horrifying moments following the magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku, Japan on March 11, 2011 at 2:46pm, triggering a massive tsunami and nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The mega-disaster destroyed cities and towns throughout the region, crumbling buildings, crushing cars, causing massive flooding—and taking more than 18,000 lives in the process.

Episode 2, “The First Year” (link goes live Jan. 6), depicts the painstaking recovery efforts undertaken by Japan over the following year, as the country worked tirelessly to rebuild homes and buildings that were either completely destroyed, as well as repair or rebuild ports, dams, roadways, and other infrastructure devastated by the disaster.

Along the way, the series tells stories of the personal experiences of those who were affected by the disaster, using first-hand accounts to depict people’s experiences that day as well as the hardships they faced during the aftermath.

Episode 1, The First 3 Days, will air on Friday, January 8 at 8:10pm EST, then Saturday, January 9 (three separate air times), and Friday, January 15. Episode 2, The First Year, will air on Friday, January 15 at 8:10pm EST, then Saturday, January 16 (three separate air times) and Friday, January 22 (see local television listings for all air times). NHK WORLD-JAPAN is presented in 13 major US markets through its partnerships with public television broadcasters in each market, and across the country via DIRECTV (channels 322 and 2049).

The lectures highlighted the work of the Tohoku Agricultural Science Center for Reconstruction (TASCR), which was set up in 2014 to develop interdisciplinary research on large-scale natural disasters and environmental deterioration. It has also run agriculture reconstruction education programmes and certified some 460 “Meisters,” many of whom currently work or volunteer on regional projects.



One such project is the cultivation of clean tropical fruits and organic tomatoes in Fukushima’s Katsurao Village, after the accident at the Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant led to concerns about the safety of local produce. With funding from the Fukushima prefectural government, TASCR and Associate Professor Kazuhisa Kato started the Katsurao Plant Factory in 2018.

Greenhouses

The facility has three greenhouses, in which several types of organic tomatoes and 30 mango trees are being cultivated. Each greenhouse is fitted with technology that can control temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration, and the crops are monitored by researchers and staff through multiple cameras, an automatic data storage system and regular site visits. “When the funding runs out in 2021, this Katsurao Plant Factory will transition to a joint-research project with one of the commercial companies we have been working with, to try to create new agricultural businesses in the Hamadori area,” said Kato. “Our goal is to develop a method for harvesting bigger and uniformly sweeter products that people want to eat.”

In his lecture, Professor Minoru Ikeda described how the university’s Onagawa Marine Field Centre had to be rebuilt after the 2011 tsunami completely destroyed the laboratories there.



“We probably lost several hundred million yen of pure research,” he said. “But even worse, there were some samples and data that will never be available again. That’s now lost forever.”

Ecosystems

In the decade since the disaster, the centre has been monitoring the recovery process of the coastal ecosystems and doing research on the state of genetic diversity in coastal marine organisms.

“I think one significant result of the disaster in 2011, is that it shifted the motivation for research,” said Ikeda. “The movement to use science in the region’s reconstruction has led to many researchers choosing research topics that are practical or necessary, rather than to satisfy an academic curiosity.”

Other speakers at the symposium included: Pofessor Hiroyasu Kitashiba, who spoke of an effort to restore farmland in tsunami-affected areas using salt-tolerant cruciferous plants; Associate Professor Yoshihisa Suyama, who has been studying the genetic diversity of tree species around Japan using state-of-the-art analytics; and Associate Professor Chinatsu Yonezawa, who has been monitoring large areas of devastation using aerial observation techniques, to assess the impact of reconstruction efforts on ecosystems.

Local stakeholders Takafumi Kawaguchi of Higashimatsushima City, and Kazunori Iwaya of Katsurao Village in Fukushima, also shared insights on the recovery efforts in their areas from the grassroots level.

“I think in general, most of us working on TASCR projects have achieved our initial objectives, but of course there is always more work to be done,” said Shinichiro Ogura, Deputy Director of TASCR, and a professor at the Graduate School of Agriculture. “For example, several challenges that we did not anticipate when we first started have become apparent, such as the idling of land due of the aging population in many rural villages. That is definitely something we need to address going forward.”

Innovative technology

A potential solution might be found in the innovative use of technology, as described by Professor Koki Homma in his lecture. He spoke of evaluating crop productivity using drones over Sendai City’s coastal areas. Like the devices in the Katsurao Plant Factory greenhouses, new technology and AI can be used to provide highly accurate monitoring and environmental control in rural projects, he said.

“Traditional farming methods might not be practical for Japan’s ageing farmers. With IT, some activities can be less labour intensive, and some can even be done remotely. This might help to attract more young people to become farmers, especially in disaster-affected areas.”

The symposium attracted more than 70 participants, many from disaster-affected communities. There was a lively discussion session after the lectures, where the participants had a chance to engage with the researchers, and to ask questions about current and future projects.

The past year was a wild ride with so many unexpected twists and turns that even the thought of a tsunami at Lake Tahoe probably doesn’t sound out of reason.

Several thousand years ago according to Dr. Richard Schweickert, a retired professor of geology at the University of Nevada, Reno who has spent most of his career working in the Sierra Nevada, Tahoe had a tsunami.

Whether he is mapping or studying faults around the basin, Schweickert and colleagues are dedicated to research around the basin.

Schweickert has been collecting evidence for over 15 years that have helped piece together the tsunami theory.

In 1999, the idea of one or more large tsunamis hitting Lake Tahoe first took fruition by Dr. Mary Lahren when she and Schweickert were mapping on land near Eagle Rock close to Homewood.

While a specific date is the hardest to pinpoint, it is estimated that a tsunami hit Lake Tahoe about 10,000 – 20,000 years ago after a massive earthquake shook the basin.

Over the years more evidence inspired researchers to dig deeper into what may have taken place in the region, including several faults that had never before been mapped.

In 1998, Jim Gardner at the United States Geological Survey released a detailed map. Jim Moore of USGS began a collaboration with Schweickert in 2005.

The map showed the landslide that occurred at McKinney Bay along with several other indicators that all point to the tsunami theory.

While Schweickert and other researchers had already been collecting data on land, Dr. Christopher Kitts, Associate Professor at Santa Clara University of the Mechanical Engineering Department and Director of SCU Robotics Systems Laboratory, first brought his students and equipment to Lake Tahoe to take a closer look at lies beneath the surface of the lake about 13 years ago.

“We began to realize there is underwater evidence that could also be attributed to the tsunami,” said Schweickert.

In 2005, the team which consisted of Dr. Winnie Kortemeier from Western Nevada College, Kitts, Moore, Lahren and Schweickert researched the Tahoe City Shelf where they discovered “boulder ridges” which have never been described in a lake before.

Similar to the small ripples you see on the beach when you walk along the shore, massive ripples formed due to the volume and force of gigantic waves.

Some ripples which are “boulder ridges” are as tall as 6.5 feet and extend as long as 6,562 feet on the Northwest side of the lake.

These perfectly aligned boulder ridges were found in four different locations just off the west shore, adding to the theory of “mega ripples” that would imply “mega waves.”

Schweickert says that there is no other explanation to why these boulders were perfectly lined up in a row underwater.

If you are on a boat on a relatively calm day, these boulder ridges can be seen with a naked eye at a depth of about 15-30 feet.

Large sand waves can also be found at 15 areas around the lake. They were caused by the flow of large volumes of water into the lake from onshore, some reaching almost 10 feet high.

The research team spent 40-50 days all together on the lake using robotics to take a deeper look and interpret underwater features of the lake.

Another indicator is that beneath the surface, Lake Tahoe has massive vertical canyons, some as deep as 200 feet, that have been carved into the sidewall such as in Rubicon Point.

“A mass amount of water had to have been thrown out onto the shores that poured back in carving the sidewalls,” said Schweickert. “Extremely large volumes of water were pouring into the sides of the lake.”

Some of these canyons extend to some of the deepest parts of the lake.

One of these locations is the Tahoe Keys in South Lake Tahoe, where the largest number of deep canyons are carved into the sidewall of the lake.

“The landslide generated such large waves that they flooded low areas around the sides of the lake and produced these features,” he said. “Lake Tahoe is the only lake we are aware of that has features like this, out of anywhere else in the world that has been documented.”

This earthquake not only shook the ground in Tahoe but caused approximately 3.5 cubic miles of the surrounding earth to dramatically slide 1,640 feet into the lake.

When the mass hit the lake at that force, it created a splash that caused waves that were about 300 feet high. The immense height of these waves lowered the lake’s water level by 33 feet for a period of time.

The earthquake and consequential tsunami waves altered the Tahoe Basin.

Lake sediment and glacial deposits were swept into the lake and the sheer force of the waves flattened countryside areas around the lake such as the relatively “flat” area found from Bijou to Meyers in South Lake Tahoe.

Secondary landslides also wiped out life that inhabited the edges of the lake. The most impacted areas of the lake from the massive waves were the Glenbrook and Zephyr Cove areas and Stateline to Baldwin Beach in South Lake Tahoe.

Enormous waves may have reached the upper Truckee River Canyon before pouring back into the lake.

To understand the impact, Schweickert has been researching active faults around the basin.

While evidence of several faults have been around since the 1960s, Schweickert mapped one of the faults called the North Tahoe fault that runs northeast from the lake through Incline Village and over Mount Rose and even into Reno.

The West Tahoe Dollar Point fault runs north-south along the West Shore, and the third fault, called the Tahoe Sierra, runs through the mountains just west of the lake.

“Major earthquakes on the West Shore can produce a series of potential hazards,” he said.

“As of now, it doesn’t look like something that should cause worry for those who live in the basin. “The hazard of forest fires in the basin is far greater,” said Schweickert.

With active faults and relatively “weak” sediment in some areas of the lake, he says that there is a possibility of another tsunami occurring in Lake Tahoe again.

“There is no way to predict if it’s 20,000 or 20 years from now,” he said.

Other researchers have also worked on this theory. While there is no work currently being done by the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, they still highlight the historic tsunami in their outreach and in Lake Tahoe in Depth.

The underwater landslide that caused a destructive tsunami is recreated by computer simulation in TERC’s video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_mzGm-g9LI .

Every year, Kitts brings students to Lake Tahoe who want to use their gear. Schweickert hopes to continue future research with Kitts and his team. As technology advances, he hopes the robotics team can go even deep in the lake in the future.

“There are still a lot of places we haven’t been to,” he said.

Schweickert released an ebook last fall, “Journeys Across Nevada’s Wild Lands,” that takes readers on a geological history tour and includes portions of the south and east sides of Lake Tahoe.

TOKYO - A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.

The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.

Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.

There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.

Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.

The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.

Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.

""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.

Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.

""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.

""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.

""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.

Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.

Renowned author Yu Miri, who lives in Fukushima's Minamisoma city, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.

""My house in Odaka, Minamisoma city is all messed up,"" she wrote.

""I hear the ground rumbling. And another quake,"" she tweeted about an aftershock.

Aerial footage broadcast by NHK showed a hillside that collapsed onto a highway in Fukushima region, severing the road. It was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt.

The US Geological Survey registered the quake at a revised magnitude of 7.1 with a depth of 51 kilometers.

Japan sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors.

""The seismology observatory upon its assessments has now verified and confirmed the cancellation of the warning and 'all clear information' (is) issued to the whole Fiji group,"" it said.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirmed in a tweet that a tsunami had been generated.

The bureau warned of a threat to Lord Howe Island, which is about 550 kilometres east of Australia's mainland, but said there was no need for evacuations.

Locals in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila said they felt the quake but there was no damage from either the shake or subsequent waves.

The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of ""strong and unusual currents"" in northern coastal areas but said there was no tsunami risk.

""There isn't a threat to land so we haven't issued a tsunami alert,"" the disaster agency's acting director Roger Ball told Radio New Zealand.

He advised those in affected areas to ""stay out of the water and stay off the beaches"" but said the danger posed was not enough to warrant a nationwide warning.

""Waking everybody up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning with emergency mobile alerts we didn't feel was a proportionate response,"" he said.

There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the tsunami or the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7.

The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity.

In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.

In a gritty Paris suburb, Zineb, Danielle and even Benjamina, who is in his late 70s, say they only want one thing: to desperately get back to work.

Like towns all over the world, residents of Grigny, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) south of the French capital, are struggling after losing jobs in the pandemic.

But this downtrodden town, with its sprawling high-rise, low-cost housing estates, was already known as the poorest in mainland France.

Nearly half its 30,000 residents, many of them immigrants, live below the poverty line, surviving on less than 900 euros ($1,086) a month, according to the Observatoire des Inegalites, a non-governmental body that studies inequality in France.

Grigny mayor Philippe Rio said he fears the percentage has only increased further since the virus outbreak, given the number of people signing up for state aid.

One of them is Benjamina Rajoharison.

Despite being aged 77, he used to do manual work which he said paid well.

But he has been out of a job for nearly a year and now he and his wife scrape by on welfare payments.

Once the monthly rent of 580 euros is paid, the couple is left with 300 euros to make ends meet until the end of the month.

""That's nothing at all,"" Rajoharison told AFP.

He hopes to find odd jobs to survive once all the Covid-19 related restrictions are lifted, he said.

The couple lives on the 10th floor of a tower block in Grigny 2, one of Europe's biggest housing complexes and also one of the most run-down in France.

Piles of rubbish are strewn at the entrance of some of the buildings whose doors are shattered.

But Rajoharison's little studio flat is neat and tidy, and decorated with pictures of flowers.

Rio, the mayor from France's Communist party, says that the pandemic has exacerbated poverty, especially in the housing estate, which he says has become a ""ticking time bomb.""

""Between last March and December, the number of unpaid charges, including for water and heating, has practically doubled,"" he told AFP.

""And if we can't pay for the water and heating, that means we also can't pay for upkeep and emergency repairs.""

- 'Social tsunami' -

On a recent day, a few streets from the tower block, some 40 people waited in line for free meals and other goods distributed by the Restos du Coeur charity, which hands out food packages and hot meals to those in need.

The association has seen a significant jump in the number of people seeking assistance because of what Rio describes as the ""social tsunami"" brought upon by the pandemic.

Among those in the queue is Danielle, a 21-year-old from Ivory Coast in need of nappies and milk for her baby daughter.

""Before coronavirus, my partner and I worked a bit but since the first wave of the pandemic, we haven't been able to find jobs,"" said Danielle, who is undocumented and previously earned money cleaning houses.

Naima, 37, who is French-Moroccan and used to work under temporary employment contracts, says she has seen her living standards dip even further.

""Everything has stopped because of Covid,"" she lamented. ""It has impacted my personal life and I feel depressed.

""Thankfully, we have income support"" which guarantees a minimum income to those in need.

Zineb, a Moroccan in her 30s who is also undocumented, dreads losing the social interaction she currently enjoys at the Resto du Coeur, once winter is over.

""When I set foot in the Resto du Coeur, I forget my troubles and I feel strong and happy,"" said the mother, who lives with her two children in a tiny, stuffy hotel room with bunk beds, a sofa bed, a small desk and kitchen utensils and plates stored in the shower.

Many people are reliant on food assistance for survival, even though the key challenge now is getting back to work and finding jobs, Rio said.

""One year after the quake caused by the first lockdown, we now know that the crisis will be long-lasting,"" he said.

France's economy shrank 8.3 percent in 2020, data released last month showed, as the virus plunged countries across Europe into their deepest recessions since World War II.

Rio was among several mayors who wrote to President Emmanuel Macron last year pleading for assistance for his town.

Since then, the government has pledged to allocate one percent of its recovery plan to suburbs like Grigny.

The hardware behind the development this new predictive AI tool goes by the name of Fugaku. Developed by Riken and Fujitsu, it was fired up midway through last year to become the world’s most powerful supercomputer. This computational power was put to use by a research team from Fujitsu, Tohoku University, and the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute, running tsunami simulations at high resolution.

A deep learning algorithm was used to study and corroborate the waveform data of offshore tsunamis at the time of an earthquake with the resulting flooding conditions on dry land, improving its accuracy over time. Training the model in this way led to the creation of an AI that could predict tsunami flooding in near real-time, with a high spatial resolution.

While the model needs to be trained in advance on Fugaku, it can be loaded onto regular PCs and fed waveform data to carry out the predictions in seconds.

Scientists have used the world’s fastest supercomputer to develop an AI tool that predicts tsunami flooding in almost real-time.

The system was created by researchers in Japan, one of the most seismically active areas in the world.

Tsunamis have occurred so frequently in the archipelago’s history that the Japanese invented a word to describe the phenomenon: “tsu” meaning harbour, and “nami” meaning wave.

In 2011, the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that caused around 20,000 deaths and the worst nuclear distance since Chernobyl.

The tragic event exposed many shortcomings in Japan’s tsunami prediction method. The new AI model was designed to provide a more effective approach.

The system’s developers first high-res tsunami simulations on the Fugaku supercomputer, which generated 20,000 possible outcomes.

This data was used to train the AI to predict flooding conditions before a tsunami strikes land by analyzing offshore waveforms at the time of an earthquake.

Notably, the model can also run on ordinary PCs, which will make it easier to use in prediction systems,

The researchers tested the system on a theoretical tsunami in Tokyo Bay. They say it produced highly accurate predictions in a manner of seconds for a variety of different tsunami scenarios.

They envision using the model to more accurately and rapidly obtain detailed flooding forecast data for specific areas. This could provide vital insights into the effects of tsunamis on buildings and roads in coastal urban areas.

Ultimately, it could give disaster management teams a powerful tool for planning their disaster mitigation and evacuation strategies."

This rapid flooding prediction based on early waveforms can be used for correspondingly rapid evacuation notices and disaster preparation.","ai, fugaku, fugakutrained, data, university, disaster, model, flooding, tsunamis, monitor, waveforms, tsunami, used",tsunami,geophysical event,"Last year, Riken launched Fugaku, the world’s fastest supercomputer, a year ahead of schedule. The system launched early in order to combat a disaster threatening Japan: COVID-19. Now, with the pandemic appearing to wane – in no small part due to the help of supercomputers like Fugaku – the massive system is being tasked with another disaster that regularly threatens the country: tsunamis.

Almost exactly ten years ago, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake set off a devastating tsunami that struck the coast of Tōhoku. Nearly 16,000 people were killed, thousands more were injured and thousands remain missing – and beyond the human cost, hundreds of billions of dollars in damage made it the most expensive natural disaster in known human history.

Needless to say, it would have been good to have some warning.

Fujitsu – which jointly developed Fugaku with Riken – partnered with the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University and the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo for the new initiative. In partnership, the three organizations have developed an AI model to predict flooding from tsunamis in “near real-time.”

The model processes incoming data on offshore tsunami waveforms, combined with high-resolution data on the coastlines, to generate precise, near-instant predictions of how a given tsunami will flood a given area, including impacts on buildings and roads.

Training data for the model was generated on Fugaku, whose 158,976 nodes and 415 Linpack petaflops simulated a series of 20,000 tsunamis, their ensuing waveforms and the resulting flooding on land. These simulations were accelerated by Fugaku’s built-in AI features and optimization.

Using the data from these 20,000 simulations, the researchers then train the AI model to understand the relationship between waveforms and flooding. This work on heavy-duty hardware pays off when the model is actually deployed: the fully trained model can be run on ordinary computers in mere seconds, and its results have been verified using comparisons with the tsunami model used by the Cabinet Office of Japan.

This rapid flooding prediction based on early waveforms can be used for correspondingly rapid evacuation notices and disaster preparation. This will mark a major shift from previous methods, which relied on crude databases of earthquakes and flooding to provide coarse predictions.

The tsunami project was granted access to Fugaku through Riken’s program for “preliminary use projects,” applications for which were solicited in advance of its general availability."

Matt Atwater, CEO of Glastonbury-based Tsunami Tsolutions, is used to confronting the unexpected.

Image Matt Atwater

He co-founded his company, with an initial focus on aerospace IT, just after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s. In 2007, his business partner passed away, followed by the Great Recession a year later.

So when COVID-19 hit the global stage, decimating the commercial airline industry, Atwater was prepared to weather the storm. In fact, despite the initial negative impact from the pandemic early last year, Tsunami Tsolutions added 30 new employees during the back-half of 2020 and saw revenue increase by over 20%.

Atwater credits his company’s long-term strategic diversification of services – and a focus on two key Greater Hartford industries, aerospace and defense – with Tsunami’s success.

Since its founding, Tsunami has grown from IT services to providing data analytics, engineering support, regulatory compliance and business consultation within the broader aerospace ecosystem, which includes power generation, manufacturing and repair organizations and the military.

And it’s paying dividends. As a privately-held business, Atwater declined to reveal financials, but noted that revenue for the company has been growing 17% annually for the past five years.

As airlines look to rebound from the devastating impact of COVID-19 – which caused passenger traffic to drop by 90% worldwide at the height of travel restrictions in the second quarter last year and dozens of international and smaller carriers to file for bankruptcy – creating efficiencies driven by data analytics and prudent fleet management will be top concerns. That creates opportunities for companies like Tsunami, which helps businesses try to improve profit margins through data insights and forecasting.

A study by the International Civil Aviation Organization determined that a typical commercial plane’s maintenance costs — including the ordering of new parts — can account for up to 45% of a plane’s total operating expenses. Those are bottom-line costs that can be reduced through data-driven decision-making and real-time analytics.

International expansion

Don Yeo, a senior program manager for Peraton, a Calgary, Canada-based avionics supply chain and engineering company that provides repair and maintenance services, understands the importance of reliable data.

It not only drives decisions about when to order parts, he says, but also provides statistics and reports to government regulatory bodies.

“We have nearly $750 million of Canadian inventory in our system and we need to make sure we track that in the most efficient manner possible,” Yeo said. “We actually have over 80,000 line items in our maintenance [tracking] system.”

Peraton uses Tsunami’s data tracking tools, which generate custom reports that reflect an understanding of his company’s business-specific needs.

“It’s created a lean management on our materials [ordering],” Yeo said. “It helps inform our purchasing decisions and makes our supply chain more efficient.”

In fact, Yeo estimates that Tsunami’s applications have increased his company’s efficiency by up to 20%.

The in-depth knowledge and employee expertise in the aerospace sector is a real value-add, Atwater says, and with aerospace giants like Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford and Collins Aerospace in Windsor Locks, the Greater Hartford region provides a deep talent pool.

Tsunami has grown to 163 employees. That expertise – and its more nimble size – has enabled Tsunami Tsolutions to compete with bigger firms in both the aerospace business consulting and IT markets.

“It’s not just about price, but our capabilities,” said Atwater. “It’s not just that we bring a level of expertise, but we can provide it more quickly [than some of the bigger players].”

Atwater says his company’s client base includes a strong mix of long-term clients with ongoing support services — like Bristol-based Barnes Group, Pratt & Whitney and Stratford-based Sikorsky — and project-based work for clients looking to scale-up their capabilities.

His firm is also growing its international footprint both through subcontract work with multinational companies and inking its own international deals, including a large foreign client it secured during the pandemic.

Atwater sees the international market, especially in the Middle East and Asia, as a major future growth opportunity. While Tsunami Tsolutions’ growth has been organic to date, Atwater is open to exploring an acquisition given the right circumstances.

Despite the lingering impact of COVID-19 on the aerospace sector, Atwater says, he’s bullish on his company’s future.

In 2019, Tsunami’s investment in infrastructure upgrades enabled his employees to transition to remote work more easily, including use of online portals, dashboards and tracking tools for clients.

“We even adopted a new online platform to help our employees and clients, who were more dispersed, to collaborate,” he said.

It was fortuitous planning for a leader who’s come to expect the unexpected."

As Japan marks the 10th anniversary of the 2011 tsunami, many will focus on what was lost. But lifelong resident Chouko Haga is choosing to focus on something that he says can never be fully taken away: hope.

The recovery began with what Minamisanriku residents know best – fishing. In April, a few short weeks after the disaster, the seafood market reopened one day a month in a makeshift tent. Since then, a soba noodle restaurant, offices, park, and shopping center have been rebuilt as the town was moved to higher ground.

Many fishing villages along Japan’s northern coast have an intimate and fraught relationship with the sea. Minamisanriku has become a symbol of resolve as it resurrects itself after the 2011 tsunami.

A wall of water obliterated the town, claiming the lives of 820 people. After the unthinkable human loss and almost total physical destruction, some wondered whether Minamisanriku would continue to exist as a town at all. But today the village hums with a quiet rhythm.

When the most powerful tsunami in Japanese history struck, few places were hit as hard as Minamisanriku.

Blisteringly cold gusts blow in off the ocean and sweep across the boat landing. A snowstorm warning has been issued but there is no sign of flakes in the slate gray sky. Still, the temperature is low enough to chill even the hardy fishermen and women who toil on the water off this mountainous stretch of Japan’s northeast coast.

It is a Saturday afternoon and many of the people who work the sea have finished for the day, but a few still tend to boats and nets. Tomoaki Saito is carrying crates from his 20-foot shrimp boat to a small, white truck parked on the quay. Mr. Saito goes shrimping every day – and has the weathered face and calloused hands to prove it – making his living from the briny waters as generations before him have done in Minamisanriku.

The craggy inlet that leads into this fishing port is banked by steep slopes blanketed with trees. Similar terrain continues inland through the hills that surround the town on three sides. This striking tableau helped make Minamisanriku a popular tourist destination. Some of those who work the cobalt waters run bed-and-breakfasts to supplement their income, though fishing has always been the lifeblood of the town.

Why We Wrote This Many fishing villages along Japan’s northern coast have an intimate and fraught relationship with the sea. Minamisanriku has become a symbol of resolve as it resurrects itself after the 2011 tsunami.

Minamisanriku hums with a quiet rhythm, which in itself is perhaps remarkable. Ten years ago the town was struck by the most powerful tsunami in Japanese history. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered waves that inundated more than 200 miles of coastline, killing 18,500 people and setting off a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant that reverberated around the world. Few places were hit as hard as Minamisanriku.

“This town was buried by [52-foot] waves in five minutes. They had power beyond human imagination,” says Chouko Haga, who has spent all of his 72 years in Minamisanriku, 47 of them working for the local fishing cooperative. The soft-spoken Mr. Haga now dedicates his time to giving talks on what happened that day and how the town is working to revive itself.

After the unthinkable human loss and almost total physical destruction, some wondered whether Minamisanriku would continue to exist as a town at all. Residues of that fateful day remain. Empty lots and open spaces dot parts of the landscape, in between the soba noodle restaurant, offices, park, and shopping center that have been rebuilt as the town was moved to higher ground. But much of the activity of daily life has returned.

Minamisanriku, in that sense, mirrors the rest of Japan a decade later. Most of the destruction has been repaired, the more than 200,000 people who lost homes have largely been resettled, and work is progressing on the long decommissioning process at the badly damaged nuclear plant.

Yet even in this country, with its culture of stoicism in the face of adversity and emphasis on the collective, the people of the Tohoku region stand out for their resilience amid such a wrenching moment.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor “[The people of Minamisanriku are] quiet, kind, and calm. They don’t show their sadness.” – Kurumi Endo, a resident of Minamisanriku, who works with her husband, Kazuhiko (right), harvesting seaweed

The wall of water

March 11, 2011, was unfolding like most any day in Minamisanriku. Kazuhiko Endo was thinking about what he was going to do on the weekend while working his wakame seaweed beds. Then, shortly before 3 p.m., the earth began to rumble. Soon, it was shaking violently.

Like many people who live on this disaster-prone coastline, he knew what would eventually follow – a wall of water. He grabbed what equipment he could and spirited it off to the building where he dries seaweed, about a half-mile uphill from the dock. Then he headed for even higher ground.

The picturesque slopes of Minamisanriku’s inlet compressed the surging waters, amplifying the already immense power of the tsunami. Wave after wave hurtled over the 18-foot sea wall, obliterating the town.

Though 820 people here lost their lives that day, many more were likely saved by Minamisanriku’s disaster emergency team. Members heroically stayed at their posts issuing desperate warnings, closing floodgates, and contacting evacuation centers until the waves engulfed their building.

The immediate response to the disaster was hampered by the devastating casualties and infrastructure damage suffered by the local police, fire department, government, and hospital. The main road in and out of town, which became congested as many of Minamisanriku’s 17,500 residents attempted to flee after the tsunami warning sounded, was destroyed.

With the road and nearby railway line gone, and cellphone networks down, the town was effectively cut off. Supplies, rescuers, and medical personnel could only reach Minamisanriku by air.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor Fishing boats are moored off Minamisanriku, Japan, which has largely been rebuilt after being hit by a tsunami.

Among those unable to make contact in the aftermath was Mr. Saito, the shrimp fisherman, who was attending a fishing cooperative meeting 25 miles south in Ishinomaki, which was also devastated.

“I called my wife about 100 times but couldn’t get through,” he says. “She was safe, and so was my son because he was at the high school, which is up on high ground.”

More than a dozen of his relatives in Minamisanriku and other communities along the coast didn’t survive.

For survivors, the early weeks in the shelters were particularly tough: Food and clean water shortages affected the more than 10,000 evacuees. Poor sanitation led to outbreaks of disease, and radiation was leaking from three reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant to the south.

The spirit of pulling together was crucial as the town began the long, arduous task of resurrecting itself. In some ways, the bonds of this close-knit community grew tighter.

The recovery began with what Minamisanriku residents know best – fishing. In April, a few short weeks after the disaster, the seafood market – a vital piece of the town’s identity – reopened one day a month in a makeshift tent.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor “This town was buried by [52-foot] waves in five minutes. They had power beyond human imagination.” – Chouko Haga, who used to work for a fishing cooperative, now gives talks on the tsunami that hit his town a decade ago

With much of their fleet destroyed, fishermen and women banded into small groups the first few years after the tsunami, sharing boats, equipment, and catches. “Fishing is a hard life, even tougher than farming,” says Mr. Haga. “It was pretty competitive before the disaster. There was quite a lot of rivalry between the fishermen. But after what they went through, and then working together, they are much more cooperative now.”

The equipment Mr. Endo thought he had carried to safety was washed away, as were his boats. “But with money donated through a 24-hour TV charity program, fishermen in Chiba [north of Tokyo] bought me a new boat and brought it here,” he says. “People here now find it easier to talk to each other, because of that experience we shared.”

Mr. Endo’s wife, Kurumi, survived the earthquake that struck Kobe in 1995, killing nearly 6,500. Living through that disaster prompted her to volunteer in Minamisanriku, helping to revive the farming of seaweed, for which the area is famous.

The folks of Minamisanriku are “quiet, kind, and calm,” says Ms. Endo. “They don’t show their sadness.”

Returning in 2013, she met Kazuhiko and they married shortly afterward. Now they work the seaweed beds together.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor Workers build a new sea wall in the coastal town of Minamisanriku on Feb. 2, 2021, to protect against future tsunamis. Waves from the 2011 disaster, triggered by a massive earthquake, reached 52 feet high.

A false sense of security

Approximately 20% of the globe’s major earthquakes strike the Japanese archipelago, many of the strongest along its northern Pacific coast. The area near Minamisanriku was battered by tsunamis triggered by massive tremors in 869, 1896, and 1933.

The 1960 Great Chilean Earthquake is one of only three recorded as more powerful than the 2011 temblor. It caused a tsunami that traveled for nearly 24 hours across the Pacific and hit Minamisanriku with 16-foot waves, killing 41. Mr. Haga was in elementary school and remembers the day clearly.

“Because of that, we had tsunami drills every year,” he notes. “And that is why the town’s three schools were built on high ground. That saved most of the children in 2011, and the schools were able to be used as evacuation centers.”

Yet the sea wall built in response to the 1960 tsunami gave some a false sense of security. “My older brother and his wife thought they would be safe as their place was high up and the 1960 tsunami hadn’t reached it,” says Mr. Haga. “But the waves hit the house and they both died. My wife went [to their house] at first, but decided to go further up the mountain and somehow escaped.”

He shows a picture of himself standing on the foundation of his former home, all that was left of the house that had stood in the center of the town. “I found nothing, not a single photo, a dish, a piece of clothing, that I could keep as a memory,” he says. “But I used a piece of the foundation as a rock in the garden of my new house.”

A physical renaissance

Under Minamisanriku’s reconstruction plan, authorities decided that only commercial buildings would be built on the site of the old town center. Residences would be placed on higher ground, presumably beyond the reach of the next tsunami.

The basic elevation of the town has been raised more than 32 feet using rock cut from the encircling mountains. Construction continues on the flatlands where the old town stood, but like the emotional scars quietly borne by so many, evidence of the destruction is not easily erased.

At the heart of the town’s physical renaissance is the Sun Sun Shopping Village. Moved from a temporary location to its current spot in 2017, it houses dozens of shops and eateries in two broad rows of wooden buildings. The restaurants all serve local seafood. Even pizza is topped with harvests from the sea: One outlet’s signature dish is wakame seaweed pizza.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor Visitors in Minamisanriku check out stores and restaurants inside the Sun Sun Shopping Village, which has become a symbol of recovery from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor A bridge connects the shopping mall and a park commemorating the wrenching moment in the town’s history.

Along with other elements of the rebuilding plan, the shopping village was designed by internationally renowned architect Kengo Kuma (designer of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium), a source of local pride.

A footbridge connects the shopping village to the Minamisanriku Memorial Park, which opened in October 2020. At its center is the shell of the three-story disaster emergency building, its reddish-brown steel girders the most visible standing remnant of March 2011. The building and what happened there have been a source of friction in this town still working through its pain.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor Two women place flowers on a shrine to Miki Endo, who is credited with saving many lives when she continued to issue warnings from the building’s roof in a moment of heroic self-sacrifice.

Robert Gilhooly/Special to The Christian Science Monitor The skeletal remains of the local disaster management center that was destroyed in the 2011 tsunami are preserved in a park in the rebuilt town of Minamisanriku. The memorial is controversial because some residents find it too painful a reminder of loved ones who died when the waves struck.

For some, the sight of the building is too raw a reminder of that ominous day. Even among the families of the 41 government workers and citizens who died there, opinions are divided. For now, the town has decided to keep it as a memorial until 2031, and then look again at whether to demolish it. Recriminations have also surfaced over whether the disaster team should have been ordered to evacuate.

Mr. Haga is convinced that the actions of Miki Endo helped save the life of his wife and many others. She is the young team member who broadcast warnings over the town public-address system for 30 minutes after the earthquake struck, until the waves engulfed her. In fact, dozens of others also died doing vital work, but it was the story of Ms. Endo that captured the public imagination. Her self-sacrifice made her a posthumous national hero, but the singular focus on her caused resentment among some who had also lost loved ones.

Like many in the town, Mieko Endo, Miki’s mother, has kept herself busy the past 10 years as a way of not dwelling on the loss. She avoided news in the aftermath of the tsunami and was unaware that her daughter’s actions had become known even beyond Japan’s shores. Ms. Endo empathizes with the trauma experienced by all those who suffered loss, but criticism of the attention given to her daughter clearly stings.

“After the earth had shaken that much, can you imagine how terrified she was? She was only 24,” says Ms. Endo, her eyes filling with tears. “She must have wanted to run away. I wanted her to run away. I’m proud of what my daughter did, of who she was.”

When Ms. Endo opened a small guesthouse behind her home in 2014, there was only one candidate for its name, “Miki no Ie” – Miki’s House.

I’m proud of what my daughter did, of who she was.” – Mieko Endo, standing near a guesthouse named after her daughter Miki, who was one of more than 40 officials who lost their lives in the town’s disaster management center

Gifts of “courage and hope”

Minamisanriku’s population is now 12,500, almost a third smaller than when the tsunami struck. Many of those who were evacuated to other cities and towns never returned. The disaster accelerated the demographic trends impacting much of Japan, particularly in rural areas: a shrinking population and the drift of young people to big cities.

The Japanese often used to say they suffered from heiwa-boke, a self-deprecating phrase that translates to something like “peace-foolishness.” It spoke to the relative ease of life in the decades from the 1960s onward, when Japan enjoyed prolonged economic prosperity after rising from the destruction of World War II. It’s not a term heard often since the 2011 triple disasters of the quake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster.

The major rebuilding on the northeast coast is almost done; the 10-year program is reaching the end of its cycle. The last few hundred people in temporary housing are due to move into new homes by the end of March.

Minamisanriku has changed, but it is once again a busy fishing port and a tourist attraction. Indeed, with the help of a new highway carved through the mountains, it drew more than 1.2 million visitors in 2019, up from 880,000 in 2010. The hospital has been rebuilt with the help of $20 million donated through the Taiwanese Red Cross.

Local people express gratitude for the aid they received from around the world. “It let us know we were not alone. It gave us courage and hope when we had no food, no clothes,” says Mr. Haga.

“If you have your life, if you are still alive, then there is hope and the potential to do something, to carry on,” he adds. “That is what I felt then and what I feel most strongly to this day, looking back at these 10 years.”"

Healthcare is under attack and the instigators are gangs of ransomware-wielding criminals. Rapidly evolving attack methodologies and the ongoing pandemic are creating something of a perfect storm, a veritable crime-tsunami targeting the most at risk people at the worst possible time.

Ransomware remains the biggest global cyber threat to healthcare, according to research from security vendor Check Point. From November onwards, the researchers say, the number of attacks targeting healthcare have grown by 45%.

To put that into some perspective, Check Point says this equates to more than double the increase in cyber-attacks across all global industry sectors in the same period. The motivation is easy to understand: these criminal operators are looking for the biggest profit in the shortest timescale, and healthcare providers under the pandemic makes for the perfect target.

Tailored attacks

The fact that healthcare providers are being targeted during the Covid-19 pandemic is not news. Threat intelligence experts have been warning for the longest time that the gangs behind the ransomware are upping their game, adopting tactics more commonly associated with nation-state ‘advanced persistent threat’ operatives.

Rather than the ‘spray, pray and hope they pay’ distribution of ransomware from just a couple of years ago (the NHS was not the target of WannaCry back in 2017), the gangs are focusing on healthcare and shaping their attacks accordingly.

These are individually tailored attacks against not just a sector, but specific targets within specific targets: recon is performed to ensure that the most operations-critical parts of the target network are hit.

They are not quick and opportunistic attacks, but strategically planned ones that take time to infiltrate networks, steal credentials and move laterally. These are, and I hate to use the word, intelligent operations that employ data exfiltration before locking down a network, and that have other tricks to ‘encourage’ payment up their ever-evolving threat sleeves.

Evolution of ransomware

This evolution of ransomware is a combination of the technical and tactical. Nowhere is this better evidenced than moves towards using distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in order to get ransom negotiations started if things aren’t moving fast enough.

Such DDoS attacks are a cheap and highly effective way to disrupt business operations. Not that ransomware gangs are short of cash, sadly, but maximising profit is the goal and so such attacks can be outsourced and carried out on a continuous basis until the victim caves.

This isn’t DDoS extortion, a wider and unrelated threat, but rather a tool employed purely to ‘encourage’ contact with the attackers. Other tactics are, in many ways, even more aggressive.

Tactics such as ‘cold-calling’ organisations to demand quick payment, making the ransomware attack even more close up and personal, complete with warnings about what will happen next if a quick resolution isn’t made. A newly published Digital Shadows report reveals that some of these calls include threats to employee safety.

Not the time for complacency

While I have not seen any evidence of an uptick of attacks against NHS providers, and successful ransomware attacks on the private healthcare sector remain relatively rare, all of the above screams that this is not the time for complacency. Given that the pandemic has forced an acceleration of cross-sector remote healthcare provision in the UK, from telephone GP appointments to video-based clinical consultations, you can bet that ransomware operators are already exploring the potential to disrupt these services for their illicit gain.

Back in October 2020 after the US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a warning in conjunction with the FBI of the ongoing threat from Ryuk ransomware to US hospitals, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was quick to respond.

“The NCSC is committed to protecting our most critical assets and the health sector is a top priority,” it said in an online statement.

“Ransomware is a significant cyber risk and we continue to work closely with government and the NHS to ensure that we are taking all available measures to counter the threat.”

I used to regularly warn about the risk to patient health through vulnerabilities in legacy operating systems and internet of medical things devices.

Those risks have not gone away, but in terms of current clear and present threats, ransomware is now the one to watch for both the public and private healthcare sector in the UK, in my never humble opinion.

I will continue to repeat my mantra of education being vital in the fight against ransomware. Most attacks, and certainly the most targeted of attacks, will start with social engineering. If everyone in the organisation is aware of the risk and what it looks like in the real-world, which is less likely to be predominantly malware-driven attacks and veer more toward malicious link based phishing, then the attackers are less likely to succeed."

Unfortunately, the current public perception of the tsunami hazards is all too often a three-step denial: (1) It won’t happen to me. (2) If it does, it won’t be that bad. (3) If it is bad, there’s nothing I could’ve done anyway. This perception must be changed in order to save lives and build a culture of tsunami hazard preparedness.

So, the logical question is “When will the next big tsunami strike?” Probably after the next really big earthquake under or near the sea. As the father of modern seismology, Charles Richter is reported to have said, “Only fools and charlatans predict earthquakes.” But the odds of a large earthquake do increase every year without one. As weird as it may seem, small earthquakes are a good thing. They literally relieve the stress along seismically active areas. Long periods of time without quakes in these areas means that the pressure is continuing to build and may well be relieved by a really big quake. Those areas that are normally seismically active but have had no stress-relieving earthquakes are known as “seismic gaps.” And there are numerous seismic gaps around the world. For example, the Cascadia Subduction Zone, lying just 50 miles offshore of Oregon, Washington state, and southern British Columbia. It is similar to the fault zone off the coast of Sumatra that caused the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Then there’s the area around the popular tourist destination of Acapulco, Mexico, which sits in a seismic gap that hasn’t had a significant earthquake in over a century, and has been described as “a tectonic time bomb waiting to go off.” And then there’s Alaska with 3 gaps which have had no large earthquakes in the past century. Chile has one too, off its northern coast—and the list continues.

So, the clock is ticking.

But tsunamis are generated not only by earthquakes, but also by landslides, volcanic eruptions, and other, much weirder, causes. Most of the fatalities caused by the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska—82 out of 131 total deaths—were caused by local tsunamis generated by underwater landslides set off by the earthquake. Landslides, from the land into the sea or underwater can also be set off by other causes including heavy rain, rising sea level, and even gas bubbles trapped under the sediment lying on the seafloor that suddenly decide to pop!

So, what can we do? Not only do the chances of another tsunami increase every year, but with every year that passes, more people forget the danger. For example, Hawaii is experiencing the longest period in recorded history without being struck by a Pacific-wide tsunami, with over 60 years since the devastating 1960 tsunami from Chile. And with every year that passes, coastal populations continue to grow, and there are fewer and fewer people alive now that experienced a tsunami, take the threat seriously, and know how to respond. People often assume that in the event of an emergency they will be evacuated by first responders, i.e. police and fire department personnel. The problem with that assumption is that there simply aren’t enough first responders to carry this out, and based on our experience, in many cases they have not had adequate training due to lack of funding or time dedicated to working on natural hazard protocols. What about education of the general public or children in schools? Similar problem. This author once had a state Governor tell him, “We can’t educate the public about tsunamis. It would scare away the tourists.” Add to this the threat from local tsunamis, where for many areas there is simply no time for tsunami alerts and therefore there could be no action by emergency management and first responders. The need for tsunami preparedness education is critical. Every hotel is required to have fire evacuation information posted on the back of the door of every hotel room. But for hotels near the coast there is little or no tsunami information for hotel guests, even in beach-front hotels. And it goes well beyond hotels.

Many coastlines do not have tsunami warning signs, fewer have marked evacuation routes, and even if they did, what do they mean? Without education the signs have little value, and tsunami education is patchy at best. In our time-challenged lives, education messages need to hit home and often. Start at Grade 1 and build from there every year, involve parents, grandparents, and friends, and soon tsunami education and awareness become a normal part of the fabric of life, like using an umbrella when it rains. Every coastline is different, every tsunami is different, which is why everyone needs their own plan to keep it simple and to stick to it. Where is the nearest high ground or four-storey concrete reinforced building? How long does it take to walk there? Where is the family meeting point? Does every family member know their plan? The KISS principle is best: Keep It Simple Stupid. For example, a car might seem a logical option and will definitely be one of the only options for the unprepared, but if everyone panics there will be traffic jams, crashes, gridlock, and precious minutes lost—and if the tsunami catches you in a car…

While there may not be tsunami warning signs and evacuations routes marked, there are tsunami warning systems in many parts of the world and as such there is often time for evacuation in areas that are distant from the source of the tsunami. But for locally-generated tsunamis, especially those created by landslides, there may not be time for an official warning. You need to know what actions to take without hesitation—hence you need to have a plan. Learn where the tsunami hazard zones are around where you live, work, and play. Figure out the fastest and safest evacuation route. If you have children in school, check to see if the school is in a tsunami hazard zone, and if so, make sure they have an evacuation plan and practice it. Education goes both ways: parents can educate the school too. In the event of a Tsunami Warning, do not go to the school to grab your children. By the time you get there, they will already have been evacuated and rushing to the school will only add chaos to the situation and put you at risk.

This is all well and good, these are the perfect education and evacuation scenarios, but what about where there are no signs, no marked hazard zones, no warning system? Worse still perhaps, everybody is a tourist at some point in their life. What if the coast is unfamiliar, perhaps the language too, and so on? What do you do? Finding high ground or a safer place (e.g. a tall building) is easy: you look. Be aware of the warning signs: did you feel an earthquake, is the sea rapidly receding from the coast, or did a wave suddenly come in much further than usual? All these are potential precursors of what is to come. Move away from the coast and inland, these minutes and seconds could save your life. If it is a false alarm though, do not feel stupid, feel empowered: you knew what to do and you followed through.

What does the future hold? Have we learned from our mistakes? Will we forget the danger posed by tsunamis as time passes or will we educate and prepare for the next inevitable tsunami to save lives? It’s not if another tsunami will strike, but when!

Occurring on the 10-year anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Fukushima, Japan, this year’s exercise is a somber reminder of the dangers that come along with living in a seismically active region such as the Caribbean, said Department of Disaster Management’s (DDM) Acting Director Mr. Jasen Penn.

“Thinking back to the devastation experienced by a highly developed nation like Japan is a reminder that we should do all we can to prepare for the possibility of a major earthquake and tsunami on our shores. Having a plan and knowing what to do in those crucial moments can save your life, or the lives of your family members or colleagues,” Mr. Penn said.

DDM’s Training Manager Ms. Carishma Hicks said that the recent earthquakes near Puerto Rico and the ongoing eruption in St. Vincent should serve as reminders that the Territory is vulnerable to earthquakes and other seismic hazards, including tsunamis.

Ms. Hicks said, “Tsunami events may be rare, but they have the potential to cause a lot of harm and they can occur without advance warning. We want persons to practice how they would respond to these events so that should the Territory experience an impact, we would not waste any time in getting ourselves and our families to safety.”

Ms. Hicks said in addition to mapping out and practicing evacuation routes, the DDM recommends that persons #BeReady for a possible tsunami by planning assembly points and putting together a small bag of essentials including a first-aid kit, prescription medication, flashlight, important documents and a battery-operated radio to receive the all-clear message from authorities.

The Training Manager added, “Annual exercises are a great opportunity for families and businesses to review their emergency preparations.” Virgin Islands schools, businesses, community groups and individuals can register as participants at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Caribe21_reg.

All participants should carry out the Drop, Cover and Hold earthquake safety response. Participants should also consider whether their location is in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols when deciding whether or not to carry out an evacuation exercise. Alternatively, participants may exercise their building safety checks, update their home and family plans, or discuss other aspects of their organisation’s emergency response plan.

Caribe Wave is held annually in the region since 2009 and uses historical seismic data to generate a test scenario such as last year’s exercise, which was based on a 1755 tsunami generated by a magnitude 8.5 earthquake located off the coast of Portugal.

Approximately 74,000 persons have registered to participate in Caribe Wave this year. Participating states besides the Virgin Islands include Haiti, Aruba, United States, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The exercise is organised by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Geological Survey.

TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Tepco (9501.T), the operator of Japan's wrecked Fukushima atomic plant, said it had successfully removed spent uranium fuel from a damaged reactor building in a key step in its clean up of the site after a nuclear disaster a decade ago.

Formally known as Tokyo Electric Power, Tepco said it had transferred around 170 tonnes of spent uranium fuel from high up in the building to a safer location -- the second successful operation of its kind and the first to be carried out by remote control, due to the high radiation in the reactor building.

It comes as Japan prepares to mark the tenth anniversary of the March 11, 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters. It will provide Tepco with important experience and data for the much tougher and time consuming task of extracting melted reactor cores and debris in the coming decades.

At 13:59 local time (0459 GMT) on Sunday the last six of 566 used fuel assemblies were removed from the spent fuel pool by a crane operated by a team located about 500 metres (550 yards) away, Tepco said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.

The transfer from the No. 3 building started in April 2019 following the safe removal of more than 1,300 fuel rods from the badly damaged reactor No. 4 building in 2014.

The work on the No. 3 unit required the removal of huge pieces of damaged equipment that fell into the pool during the explosions that rocked the nuclear site in Fukushima, in the days after an earthquake and tsunami knocked out power and emergency cooling.

Three overheated reactors melted down in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.

In the decade since, Tepco has had to contend with huge amounts of contaminated water building up at the site due to the nature of its ad hoc cooling system used to keep the melted fuel in a safe state.

The utility has also been criticised by regulators on multiple occasions for safety breaches and other failings.

For almost six minutes on March 11, 2011, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake -- the worst to ever hit Japan -- struck 370 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of Tokyo, triggering a huge tsunami that crashed into Ishinomaki, the coastal city Kurosawa had lived in his whole life.

Minutes before waves up to 10 meters (nearly 30 feet) high swept in, Kurosawa, then aged 40, had scrambled 3 meters (10 feet) up a pine tree, wrappedhis legs around a branch and hung on for his life.

""I felt like the ocean was all around me. The water was so cold it chilled me to the bone,"" he recalls.

As the water came up to his knees, Kurosawa saw people in cars gripping their steering wheels as their vehicles were washed down the road. Others who had been hanging on to trees felled by the waves were swept away. For hours, Kurosawa endured sub-zero temperatures. He thought of his wife -- he'd reached her on her cellphone for 15 seconds while in the tree, before the line went dead.

As night turned to day, he heard someone in the distance calling for help with what seemed like their last ounce of energy. He says he doesn't know that person's fate -- but Kurosawa had just survived the deadliest natural disaster in Japanese history.

More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. But the devastation went deeper than natural disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, in this part of Japan, became a catastrophe of its own.

Within 50 minutes of the first quake, the tsunami waves crested a 10-meter (33 feet) sea wall intended to protect the nuclear plant. As the water swept in, cooling mechanisms failed, melting fuel in three reactors and spewing deadly radioactive particles into the surrounding area, which have since dispersed and decayed to less-dangerous levels

This year, ceremonies to mark the disaster's tenth anniversary will be low key and socially distanced amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako will attend a memorial, pausing for a moment of silence at 2:46 p.m., the exact time the earthquake struck 10 years ago.

Despite the destruction wrought, many survivors have rebuilt their lives and communities, but for many the legacy of the disaster will forever remain.

A tsunami's power

Ishinomaki, the second largest city in Miyagi prefecture, was one of the worst-hit communities by the tsunami. Waves covered almost 5 square kilometers (500 hectares) of land and inundated nearly 15% of the city, according to the International Tsunami Information Center.

The tsunami destroyed more than 50,000 homes and buildings in Ishinomaki alone, obliterating a vibrant city center and most of its seaport and infrastructure. Nearly 3,100 people in the city lost their lives.

Kurosawa, a plumber, was working in a neighboring town 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from his city when the earthquake struck. He called his wife, who was sheltering in a bank, and told her to meet him at their home.

Minutes later, a tsunami warning was issued. He tried calling his wife again, but the phone lines were dead. Worried for her safety, Kurosawa jumped into his car and sped home to meet her so they could head to higher ground together. Cars raced past him in the opposite direction, making their way to established evacuation zones in the earthquake-prone country.

As he neared his home, he spotted what looked like tsunami barriers in the distance. When he got closer, he realized they were cars -- swept away by waves, bobbing up and down.

As he made a desperate U-turn, he glimpsed a man trying to escape the incoming water on foot. ""I pulled him into the car through the window, and we sped away from the water. But by then, the tsunami was ahead of us, too,"" Kurosawa says.

It's hard to imagine the power of a tsunami unless you've experienced it -- it's a destructive force that obliterates everything in its path -- Kenichi Kurosawaa

Soon sandwiched by the waves, the pair ditched the car and ran to find shelter.

As Kurosawa scrambled up the tree, a branch broke, and he fell onto the embankment. Kurosawa hoisted himself back up the tree just as the waves swept in. The man he'd rescued did the same. ""I almost thought I wouldn't make it,"" he says.

""It's hard to imagine the power of a tsunami unless you've experienced it -- it's a destructive force that just swallows everything up and obliterates everything in its path.""

Nuclear disaster

As the tsunami swept further inland to neighboring Fukushima prefecture, the Daiichi nuclear plant was melting down.

More than 300,000 people living near the Daiichi nuclear plant were forced to temporarily evacuate, Japan declared a nuclear emergency on March 11, 2011 for what became the worst such disaster since the 1986 Chernobyl incident.More than 300,000 people living near the Daiichi nuclear plant were forced to temporarily evacuate, according to the Red Cross. Another 50,000 people moved out of the irradiated areas voluntarily.

In the following months and years, parts of the area around Fukushima became ghost towns, visited only by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) officials, safety inspectors and tourists seeking a dark thrill. Since the disaster, TEPCO has been pumping hundreds of tons of water into the nuclear plant to cool the reactors and stop the outflow of radiation.

The cleanup from the disaster is expected to take decades and cost billions of dollars. More than 35,000 people remain displaced, 10 years after the original meltdown, according to the Fukushima authorities.

Smoke pours from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power plant days after the earthquake and tsunami.

Hajime Matsukubo, a spokesperson from the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo, an anti-nuclear public interest organization, says the regions hit by the earthquake and tsunami have mostly recovered. However, the recovery work around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has remained at a standstill since the meltdown, as despite the large amount of money spent, the population around the area has halved since 2010. ""After 10 years, what we have learned is that once a nuclear accident occurs, the cleanup is tremendously difficult,"" he said.

In 2014, the Japanese government began lifting evacuation orders for zones with annual doses of radiation below 20 millisieverts -- the maximum exposure recommended by international safety watchdogs, and the equivalent of two full-body CT scans

As of March 2020, only 2.4% of the prefecture remains off-limits to residents, with even parts of that area accessible for short visits, according to Japan's Ministry of Environment.

However, despite the decontamination efforts, a 2020 survey conducted by Kwansei Gakuin University found 65% of evacuees no longer wanted to return to Fukushima prefecture -- 46% said they feared residual contamination of the environment and 45% said they had settled elsewhere.

Fukushima also shook Japan's long-stated commitment to nuclear power. Prior to the disaster, the country's 50 or so reactors provided more than 30% of its power, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry body.

This ended on May 5, 2012, when the country's last operating reactor, in Hokkaido, shut down for inspection, leaving Japan without nuclear power for the first time in more than 45 years. (Two units of the Oi nuclear power plant were briefly restarted in 2012, but went offline again a year later.)

Following the nuclear meltdown, countries such as Germany vowed to shutter all nuclear reactors by 2022. But 10 years later, experts in Japan are divided on the use of the technology, which is better for the environment than burning fossil fuels, while the public's anti-nuclear stance has slowly waned

In August 2015, a reactor was restarted in Sendai , in Kagoshima Prefecture, on the southern island of Kyushu.

Passage of time

On the morning of March 12, Kurosawa climbed out of the pine tree. It looked like a bomb had wrecked his city.

As he made his way home, he waded through the debris, dodging parts of wrecked boats that had washed ashore. Half-collapsed buildings were submerged in water, and he struggled to breathe the smoke-laden air.

Kurosawa's wife was alive, having been evacuated to a school on higher ground. But overnight, they'd lost the friends and physical markers that made up their lives.

A 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck offshore on March 11 at 2:46pm local time, triggering a tsunami wave.

For the next six months, Kurosawa and his wife lived in rented homes and their friends' offices. In August 2011, they moved into temporary disaster housing, a prefabricated building they called home for over three years. Kurosawa put his plumbing skills to use, volunteering to help his local community with odd jobs. He still lives in Ishinomaki.

""I went from having a normal routine to having an abnormal one that became the new norm. One year, two years passed -- the abnormal reality returned to normal,"" says Kurosawa. For five years, he had dreams at night of walking through the wreckage of his hometown.

Today in Ishinomaki, Kurosawa says people's feelings toward nuclear power in the region remain just as mixed as each person's experience of the tenth anniversary of the disaster.

Kenichi Kurosawa (center) and his friends draw the words ""Ganbaro!"" or ""hang in there"" on a billboard lit up with car headlights in Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture on April 10, 2011.

""People ask me how I feel now it's been 10 years. I still feel like I'm living on that extended timeline and trying my best,"" he says.

Over the years, Kurosawa has fought to rebuild his life, business and community. Today, coastal embankments close to 10 meters (33 feet) in height extend for about 56 kilometers (34 miles) along the coast to protect his city from the ocean. New public residences have sprung up on the city's outskirts, while others are still being rebuilt.

Kurosawa says people's emotional scars take just as much time to heal as their built environment. But, he says, there is no point living in the past. Today, Kurosawa plays an active role in teaching others about disaster preparedness and keeps moving forward.

""One thing I learned from this disaster is that people need to live among each other. I think the hope lies in us,"" he says.

Sometimes, he drives past the tree that saved his life. He even tried once to reclimb it."

Ten years after a tsunami hit the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, controversy and doubts over its clean-up efforts continue to dog the industry. And the voices calling for the government to embrace alternative, greener forms of energy and to decommission its nuclear reactors have only grown louder.

After Fukushima was swamped by a tsunami that left three of its reactors in meltdown in 2011, its opaque decommissioning process has ensured the crippled plant remains in the spotlight as authorities debate what to do with the nearly 1.25 million tonnes of radioactive water used to cool the melted reactors down.

The contaminated water is currently housed in about 1,000 thousand metal tanks on the grounds of the plant and the authorities say that there is little space for more.

Widely reported plans to dump the water into the Pacific Ocean have created national and international alarm. The concern has delayed the authorities’ decision about the radioactive waters’ release but no answers have been forthcoming since then.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, touring the nearby city of Minamisoma on Saturday, said that the water disposal policy would be decided “at an appropriate time and in a responsible manner.” But he added: “We can’t delay our decision indefinitely”.

The plant’s owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has treated the contaminated water through what it calls the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS), noting on its website that this “eventually removes most of the radioactive materials except Tritium.”

Tritium, explains Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is “one of the least harmful” radioactive isotopes, and may not pose any significant threat to human health.

Much larger amounts of Tritium have already been deposited in the seas, since hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are allowed to release it and because nuclear weapons tests conducted in the Pacific in the 1950s also discharged it into the surrounding oceans.

However, Buesseler says there are more serious grounds for concern about the other more dangerous elements that will be discharged when water from the Fukushima Daiichi is let out into the sea.

Unlike the gases that escaped from the plant in high volumes in the early months of the crisis, he says, the kinds of radioactive contamination found in the waters used to cool the reactors is “a completely different beast” that includes far more dangerous isotopes such as Cobalt-60, Strontium-90, and Caesium.

By TEPCO’s own account, ALPS has “reduced” concentrations of these much more concerning isotopes but it has not eliminated them.

“What else is in the tanks is an important question before you decide what to do with it,” cautioned Buesseler, one of the world’s top experts on the issue.

While the data issued by TEPCO is incomplete, Buesseler estimates that about 70 percent of the “treated” Fukushima water in the tanks needs additional processing and that independent experts need to be brought in as part of a careful verification process.

Trust undermined

The challenge faced by the Japanese government and TEPCO is also a legacy of poor communication, concealment and misinformation about nuclear safety issues at the Fukushima plant.

“It was always: ‘Trust us, and we’ll engineer solutions’,” noted Buesseler, “I think they lost the public trust very early… So once you lose that trust, it’s hard to rebuild, and I think that still plagues them to this day.”

In the months and years that followed the 2011 disaster, a series of revelations badly damaged TEPCO’s reputation.

One of the gravest charges was that the company’s own internal studies had concluded prior to the accident that the plant might be vulnerable to a large tsunami and needed a protective barrier.

The finding was later rejected because top executives felt that the construction of the wall would be too expensive. But even after the disaster happened TEPCO and the government regulators continued to argue that such a large tsunami hitting the plant had been “unforeseeable.”

In the months after the accident, all 54 of Japan’s nuclear reactors were taken offline and the government put new safety regulations in place. The discredited Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) was replaced by the Nuclear Regulation Agency (NRA), thought to be less under the government’s thumb.

But these measures have done little ease people’s concerns about the risks of nuclear power.

A large public opinion poll conducted by national broadcaster NHK at the end of last year found that only 3 percent of the Japanese public believed that nuclear power should be expanded, compared with 50 percent who felt that it should be reduced and 17 percent who wanted its immediate abolition.

The Japanese government’s current energy plans, however, call for a significant expansion of nuclear power arguing that it remains a dependable energy source that does not contribute to climate change.

In the 10 years since the Fukushima disaster, the pro-nuclear government and the anti-nuclear citizen activists brought various cases to court and now appear to be at an impasse. The anti-nuclear camp was not able to prevent the government from restarting Japan’s nuclear plants – but Tokyo has not been able to achieve the nuclear goals it originally set out for itself.

“Even 10 years after the Fukushima accident, the government and the incumbent utilities could only reopen nine reactors,” observed Mika Ohbayashi, the director of the Tokyo-based Renewable Energy Institute. The country had 54 reactors in operation before the tsunami struck.

Today, nuclear power only contributes a little over 7 percent towards the nation’s electricity supply – not between 20 and 22 percent as originally planned, powered by the restarting of about 30 reactors. Few independent observers regard the plan as plausible.

Deep divisions

Many activists, among them Caitlin Stronell, the editor of Nuke Info Tokyo at the Citizen’s Nuclear Information Center in the Japanese capital, are flummoxed by the Japanese government’s resistance to what they regard as the obvious and only viable solution going forward – an substantial shift towards renewable energies such as solar and wind power.

Stronell scoffs at arguments that renewables are not a viable solution for Japan due to engineering challenges.

“They think that they can look after radioactive fuel for 10,000 years. They have the technology for that,” she said. “But they can’t save sunshine overnight in a battery?”

Stronell believes that the falling costs of renewables and the rising costs, financial and political, of trying to build nuclear plants and the disposing of radioactive waste may make the outcome a foregone conclusion.

“Even if it’s a business decision, nuclear power just doesn’t pay any more. It’s really expensive,” she said.

Even as Japan and the world mark 10 years since Japan’s magnitude 9.0 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, there is much ground that remains contested.

Kyle Cleveland, an associate professor at Temple University Japan and co-editor of the forthcoming book Legacies of Fukushima: 3/11 in Context, observes: “Fukushima sits behind Chernobyl as the one of the most significant nuclear accidents in world history.”

Chernobyl released more radiation into the environment and killed more people, but the fallout from Fukushima – the world’s second-worst civilian nuclear disaster – continues to be felt, affecting Japan’s economy – especially in Fukushima Prefecture – and colouring the debate over its national energy policy.

The impact of radiation on human health also remains under scrutiny, whether it be encouraging Fukushima residents to return to their homes, or the decision of what to do with the water used to cool the melted reactors.

There remains no common ground between the pro-nuclear Japanese government camp and the anti-nuclear activists who challenge them – even on basic medical facts.

“Often when people are debating radiation effects, they aren’t really talking about radiation,” Cleveland said. “They are talking about politics. It’s a proxy for politics.”"

The Meteorological Agency of Japan said in a statement that the quake struck at 6:09 p.m. local time (6:09 a.m. ET) near the Miyagi Prefecture, which was heavily damaged during the huge earthquake and tsunami of 2011, that killed thousands and made global headlines.

No major damage has been reported, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, and there have been no reports of severe injuries.

The earthquake was initially recorded as having a magnitude of 7.2 , which was downgraded later on Saturday to 6.9 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which also re-adjusted its calculations of the depth of the epicenter to 59 km from 60 km.

An initial advisory for a tsunami up to 1 meter in height for Miyagi prefecture immediately after the quake, was also lifted by Japan's Meteorological Agency later on Saturday.

The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center rescinded a similar tsunami advisory notice that had been issued. ""Based on all available data, the tsunami threat from this earthquake has now passed,"" it said in a statement.

Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority said in a post on its website that no abnormalities had been detected at three nuclear reactors in the vicinity, including both the Fukushima Daiichi and the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plants.

The strong temblor caused a temporary blackout in some areas and suspended bullet train services in the area, according to the East Japan Railway Co.

Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas and the country accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

Last month, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast near the Fukushima prefecture, which was the site of one of the world's worst nuclear disasters almost a decade ago.

Fukushima was hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake in 2011 — the strongest in Japan's history. A tsunami soon followed, leaving more than 15,000 people dead and 2,500 others still missing.

In a sign of rebirth, the area had been due to host parts of the Summer Olympics set to take place in Japan in 2020. However, the games were delayed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It was the largest quake recorded in Japan and the fourth largest in the world since seismic recording began around 1900.

Within an hour, tremendous tsunami waves inundated much of the eastern Japanese coast, sending 5- to 10-meter walls of water into coastal towns and cities. In Miyako, Iwate Prefecture, the runup height from the tsunami—the maximum elevation that water moved upland from the shore—reached 40.5 meters (133 feet) above sea level. Near Sendai, flood waters penetrated 10 kilometers (6 miles) inland.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake moved Japan’s main island of Honshu eastward by 2.4 meters (8 feet) and dropped about 400 kilometers (250 miles) of coastline by 0.6 meters (2 feet). The tsunami affected a 2000-kilometer stretch of coast and inundated more than 400 square kilometers of land in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures.

Some of the worst devastation was observed at Rikuzentakata (Iwate). The images above were acquired in 2007, 2011, and 2021 by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), a joint Japanese and U.S. instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite. The images combine infrared, red, and green wavelengths of light to make false-color images that distinguish between water, vegetation, and urban infrastructure. In the 2011 image, most of the areas in purple-blue were flooded or denuded.

The March 2011 tsunami killed more than 1,700 residents (about 8 percent of the population) of Rikuzentakata and destroyed 80 percent of its residential areas. More than 70,000 trees in the Takatamatsubara pine forest on the waterfront—planted in the 17th century as a tidewater control—were washed away. Flood waters sat for weeks on rice paddies and other agricultural land. Satellites captured scenes of the devastation just one day and three days after the event. On March 14, 2011, The Mainichi Daily News declared: “Rikuzentakata has been erased.”

A decade later, the area is still rebuilding. A 12.5-meter (41-foot) high concrete seawall now stands along two kilometers of the waterfront in Rikuzentakata. (More than 430 kilometers/265 miles of seawalls have been built up and down the Tohoku coast.) Engineers and construction crews also carried in massive amounts of soil and rock to raise the level of the land by 10 meters before new buildings were constructed. And local officials launched a project in 2017 to plant 40,000 tree seedlings along the town’s coastline.

According to the Japan Reconstruction Agency, nearly 400,000 buildings were destroyed or irreparably damaged and another 750,000 were partially destroyed across the country in March 2011. Nearly 16,000 people were killed and 2,500 are still listed as missing. The meltdown and explosions at the nearby Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant between March 12-15, 2011, added to the misery and displacement of Japanese citizens. More than 21,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding and by salt water; some has been reclaimed and some has returned to wildland. The World Bank estimated it to be the costliest natural disaster in world history. According to some estimates, Japan has spent nearly $300 billion (U.S) on rebuilding the region to date.

9.0 EARTHQUAKE

The magnitude 9.0 earthquake was one of the strongest temblors on record. It struck offshore at 2:46 p.m. and generated a towering tsunami that reached land within half an hour. A wave as high as 19 meters (62 feet) was recorded in the town of Miyako in Iwate prefecture. In Miyagi prefecture, the tsunami swept as far as 6 kilometers (3.6 miles) inland. The coastline where the tsunami had an impact stretches about 400 kilometers (240 miles).

___

18,426 DEAD

The National Police Agency says 18,426 people died, mostly in the tsunami, including 2,527 whose remains have not been found. Local authorities still regularly conduct searches in the sea and along the coast for traces of those still missing. None of the fatalities has been directly linked to radiation.

___

42,500 PEOPLE HAVEN'T RETURNED

Nearly half a million people were displaced across the northeastern region. Ten years later, 42,565 people, including 35,725 from Fukushima, still haven't been able to return home.

___

$295 BILLION COST

The government has spent 32 trillion yen ($295 billion) for the region's recovery, including construction of roads, seawalls and houses, and support for people's livelihoods. In addition, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the destroyed nuclear plant, says its costs for decommissioning, compensating evacuees and decontamination of radioactive materials outside the plant will total 21.5 trillion yen ($200 billion), though analysts say it could be much higher.

___

2.4% OFF-LIMITS

A decade after the disaster, no-go zones remain in nine Fukushima municipalities surrounding the wrecked nuclear plant. The area accounts for 2.4% of prefectural land, down from more than 10% in the initial no-go zone. Decontamination efforts, such as the removal of topsoil and tree branches and the washing down of roofs, helped reduce radiation levels. But many residents are reluctant to return because of a lack of jobs and continuing radiation concerns.

14 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE

About 14 million tons of radioactive soil, trees and other waste from decontamination efforts across Fukushima are packed in massive numbers of plastic waste bags piled at temporary storage sites. The bags, enough to fill 11 enclosed baseball stadiums, are now being transported to a medium-term storage facility being built in the two towns that are home to the Fukushima nuclear plant. The government has promised to remove the bags from the prefecture in 30 years, but a final repository has not been determined.

___

432 KILOMETERS (270 MILES) OF SEAWALL

Much of Japan's northeastern coastline hit by the tsunami has been fortified with enormous concrete seawalls as high as 15 meters (50 feet). All of the walls have been completed except for sections of the eastern coast of Fukushima. When completed, the total length will be 432 kilometers (270 miles). Critics say the walls look like giant fortresses and block sea views, while posing a possible risk of preventing water from flowing back to sea if they are breached by a future tsunami.

___

4,000 NUCLEAR PLANT WORKERS

About 4,000 workers are employed every day at the damaged nuclear plant to help in its decommissioning, which officials say will take up to 40 years, a target critics say is overly optimistic. They are removing spent fuel rods from cooling pools, reinforcing a seawall to protect from future tsunamis, treating radioactive cooling water leaking from the reactors and removing highly contaminated debris.

___

1.24 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WATER

Since the disaster, contaminated cooling water has leaked from the damaged reactor containment vessels into the basements of reactor buildings, where it mixes with groundwater. Much of the water is treated and stored in 1,000 huge tanks now crowding the plant. The operator, TEPCO, says the tanks currently contain 1.24 million tons of water and will be full in the fall of 2022. It says the water and tanks need to be removed to make room for facilities needed in the decommissioning process."

Mai was 12 when she died in one of the most harrowing stories to emerge from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. She was at Okawa primary school on the day of what became known as the triple disaster. Instead of leading children up a nearby hill away from danger, teachers decided it was safe to stay.

“She was small for her age, but even so she loved playing mini-basketball,” he says of Mai. “She always had a smile on her face and she was kind to her younger sister. She had so many friends.”



Suzuki was at work when the city of Ishinomaki was shaken by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March. After checking on his colleagues, he made his way home, convinced that Mai, whose school was set against hills 4km from the coast, was not in danger.



But rumours began to circulate that the tsunami had barrelled its way further inland than anyone could have imagined; that entire neighbourhoods had been turned into a muddy wasteland; and that something unspeakable had happened at Okawa.



“There was so much information it was difficult to know what to believe,” Suzuki says. “I heard that the area near the school had been cut off by the tsunami, but that it was OK. But as the hours passed, we realised that the tsunami had destroyed the entire town.”

In all, 74 children drowned, along with 10 teachers and staff who had been entrusted with ensuring their safety in an earthquake-prone region that lives with the ever-present threat of tsunamis. Across Ishinomaki, 3,062 people died and 415 are still missing.



After the shaking subsided, the teachers elected to lead the school’s 108 pupils to the playground rather than up a nearby mountain, where they would have almost certainly been safe from the waves.



The children lingered outside the school for more than 40 minutes before their teachers, finally aware that a tsunami was approaching, guided them towards a raised area near a river. It was there, at 3.37 pm, that the ocean caught up with them. A decade on, the bodies of four of the children have yet to be found.



With local roads made impassable by quake damage and tsunami debris, Suzuki arrived at the school by boat two days later. Mai’s body was recovered from the mud that evening. “I was taken to see her, and I couldn’t speak,” he says. “The cruelty of it was too much to take in. To see your own child, lifeless in front of you … there was grief, but also anger.”

He begged to be allowed to take Mai home to her family, but was told by police that she would have to be sent to a makeshift morgue.

“I couldn’t bear the thought of her being there … it was so cold. I took off my jumper and laid it over her. She was still wearing her glasses, so I removed them and took them with me. When my family saw me arrive home with her glasses in my hand, they knew what had happened.”



The Okawa families’ pain was compounded when it became clear that the children’s deaths could have been prevented. At the time of the disaster, the city’s hazard map did not identify the school as being in an area at risk of tsunami.

Mai’s name is heard all the time in our house … when we remember what kind of person she was. She is always by our side

In 2014, the families of 23 children filed a suit against Ishinomaki city and Miyagi prefecture, demanding ¥2.3bn (£15.3m) in damages. Five years later, the supreme court awarded them ¥1.44bn, acknowledging that the tragedy could have been averted had local authorities updated their disaster prevention measures.



Earlier court decisions had agreed with the bereaved families that the pupils would have stood every chance of surviving had they been directed towards the nearby mountain.

“It feels wrong to describe it as a victory, and it was a tough ruling for the education authorities,” says Suzuki, who supported the parents but was not part of the legal action. “The board of education had been told to designate evacuation sites, but it did nothing. The lawsuit was ultimately about protecting children’s lives, so in that respect, the court made the right decision.”



The Okawa tragedy would further divide the local community. As reconstruction gathered pace elsewhere in the city, the school remained untouched, becoming a place of pilgrimage for grieving families who prayed and left flowers at a makeshift altar in the school grounds.

Some parents said they could not bring themselves to even look at the school and called for it to be torn down; others, including Suzuki, believed its symbolism could be harnessed to spare future generations the fate of their own children.



In 2016, the city government decided to preserve the school, and in the coming weeks it will “reopen” as a memorial, with an area where visitors can pay their respects.

“I’ve always felt strongly that we should keep the school as it is,” says Suzuki, the head of a group of Okawa “storytellers” – people with a connection to the school who guide visitors and share the story of the children who once learned and played in its classrooms.



“We have cleaned it up inside … we didn’t want to leave it as it was for the sake of the children, although visitors will only be able to view it from the outside,” he says. “I know there are people who never want to see the school again, but once the decision had been made to keep it, we had to make sure we honoured their memories properly.”



When the people of Japan fall silent at 2.46pm on Thursday, Suzuki and his wife – whose parents, niece and nephew also died – and their younger daughter will remember the girl with the beaming smile whom they believe has never really left them.



“It has been a long and painful 10 years, but our feelings haven’t changed,” he says. “Mai is still the daughter we love. Her name is heard all the time in our house, not just during the sad moments, but also when we remember what kind of person she was, the things and places she loved. She is always by our side.”

The size and impact of Pacific Ocean tsunami waves on the Australian coastline are significantly reduced by healthy coral structures in the Great Barrier Reef, researchers have shown.

But their findings, published in the Natural Hazards journal, also indicate that areas of the Queensland coast would be in danger of increased damage from a tsunami if the coral was dead or dying and had lost its structural complexity.

The research was led by Dr Mandi Thran, a senior research associate at the Water Research Laboratory and UNSW School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, along with colleagues at the University of Sydney.

Using simulated models they were able to quantify, for the first time, that if the coral cover was removed completely there would be a 31% increase in offshore wave amplitude for a tsunami caused by a large-scale Mw9.0 earthquake in the Solomon Islands.

“We found that when we included rough coral cover, in our simulations, the tsunami waves were dampened,” Dr Thran says. “But when we removed that coral cover the waves actually grew in size.

The research team ran various computer simulations for different incidents that could feasibly cause a tsunami in the region — including earthquakes of strengths from 7.5Mw to 9.0Mw in the Solomon Islands, as well as landslides in and around the Great Barrier Reef itself.

For each simulation, the team first assumed the coral cover was healthy, with a rough and complex structure. They then re-ran the simulations for conditions where the coral was deemed to be smooth, such as it might be after being damaged by climate change.

Finally, models were analysed where the entire reef platform was removed, in order to assess the buffering capacity of the Great Barrier Reef itself.

Coral roughness

Where coral structures were present, the key component was the ‘roughness’ of the coral on the reef, which is maximised when it is healthy and has a vibrant complex structure.

“Being able to monitor the reef’s health and being able to quantify how rough it is, that will better equip us with the ability to anticipate what the tsunami hazard will be,” Thran said.

“We can have a better gauge on how much more hazard there is for a particular area of the coastline if the health of the reef is declining or deteriorating.”

The phenomenon highlighted by the research is very similar to the way a lens will focus light, given the fact that reefs are generally circular.

As tsunami waves approach the reef they bend inwards, with the energy focused towards the reef platform and potentially causing the waves to grow bigger and more powerful.

However, when healthy ‘rough’ coral structures are present on the reef, there is a frictional force that counteracts the effect and dampens down the waves.

Research shows that dead coral which has lost its 'roughness' does not act as a dampner against potential tsunami waves, and could actually help to increase the amplitude of such waves. Photo: Shutterstock

The researchers also noted, though, that the positive effect caused by healthy Great Barrier Reef coral is just one aspect to be considered in terms of ongoing protection from potential tsunami damage. Risk awareness, hazard education, early warning systems and resilient infrastructure should also play a large part, they said.

But in terms of the reef structures, Professor Dale Dominey-Howes from the University of Sydney, who was a co-author of the paper, says it is vital to address the damage being done by the effects of climate change.

“The most significant finding is to demonstrate clearly, in a quantifiable way, the protective effects that healthy marine reefs can provide to adjacent low-lying coastal landscapes that are at risk from flooding and from tsunami events,” Prof. Dominey-Howes said.

“Healthy coral reef acts as a buffer, mitigating the effects of tsunami waves, although it doesn't reduce it to zero. But it can slow the wave down, which reduces the power of the wave to do damage to buildings and infrastructure in the adjacent coastal plain.

“Totally separate from the issue of tsunami risk is the fact that changing climate can damage coral reef ecosystems, potentially killing them. And if we do that, we're actually amplifying the risk associated with tsunamis by killing a natural protective barrier.

“This adds weight to the argument that we need to think about protecting coral reefs from the worst impacts of climate change, which means we need to take action on human-induced climate change.”"

Grieving survivors pick through the flattened debris where their homes used to be. Deserted farms stand in the shadow of the Fukushima nuclear plant, where a catastrophic meltdown still reverberates.

These arresting images were captured by The Associated Press in 2011 after a massive wall of water levelled part of Japan’s northeastern coast, washing away cars, homes, office buildings and thousands of people.

Ten years later, AP journalists returned to document the communities that were ripped apart by what is referred to here as simply the Great East Japan Earthquake. The urge to rebuild in a land that has been wracked by millennia of disaster – volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes, war and famine – is powerful, and there are areas where there is little or no trace of the devastation of 2011.

But this triple disaster in the Tōhoku region of Japan – earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown – has been unlike any Japan has faced before, and the challenges of returning to what was normal a decade ago have been immense.

Half a million people were forced from their homes; tens of thousands have not returned yet, emptying towns that were already struggling to keep their young people from leaving for Tokyo and the other megacities. Radiation fears linger. Government incompetence, petty squabbling and bureaucratic wrangling have delayed building efforts.

Despite the setbacks and uneven progress, the Tōhoku of 2021 is a testament to a collective force of will – national, local and personal. A closer look shows that even the most breathtaking transformations carry the residue of what happened in 2011, the scars of that deep wound to the region’s psyche.

These AP images, then and now, raise a fundamental question: How do you mark change after great trauma?

In one way, it is the simplest thing in the world to describe. The removal of tonnes of rubble here, the absence of toppled tankers there. The repaved roads where there had been cracked and buckled piles of asphalt before. The gleaming new buildings that now rise above what had been cleared dirt patches.

But the starkness of this physical change also carries the idea of something that is much less clear cut, something about the people who live in these places. Their resilience, their stoicism, their grief and anger and stubborn refusal to bow to forces outside their control, whether natural or bureaucratic.

All of that, and more, is present in these powerful scenes of before and after, then and now.

When the tide finally receded, the world had changed. Trucks and houses had been swept aside like children’s toys, leaving the living to comb through a wasteland of mud and debris for their dead. Ten years on, the living are still searching, their grief never subsiding.

A father lives alone in a house at the end of a long driveway lined with cherry trees. He surrounds himself with books on the disorder that isolated his younger son in his room, unable to flee even when his mother begged him to evacuate as the tsunami roared toward them.

A mother is haunted still by the cries of stranded children, maybe even her own, calling out for help in the darkness. Even now she carries around a laminated schedule of her daughter’s kindergarten bus, as if to prove that her 6-year-old should still be alive.

A wife never gave up hope that her husband would return to her. In scribbled letters on the back of calendars, she chided her husband for staying away, sometimes writing his imagined response encouraging her to go on without him.

The 10th anniversary of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami will be a nationally televised event, with dignitaries in black suits gathering at a theater in Tokyo, where they will bow their heads and mark the moment of the disaster. For many survivors, the day will be marked by quiet prayers and family visits to gravesites.

But for others, the day will feel little different than any other date on a calendar. They remain suspended, trapped in those frantic hours a decade ago.

The earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people on a stretch of Japan’s Pacific coast more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The disasters also triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.

The central government pledged to rebuild the region and has spent around 31 trillion yen ($286 billion) on reconstruction. In the span of a few years, Japan built new neighborhoods, parks and schools. But the scale of loss here is beyond any policy response. Thousands of residents have moved away from the hardest-hit cities, with many of those who remain haunted by all that was lost.

While some survivors look backward, the larger Japanese public is preparing to celebrate the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, an event the government is intent on using to showcase its recovery from the disaster.

In Rikuzentakata, a city that lost almost a tenth of its population in the tsunami, a 12.5-meter (41-foot) sea wall encircles the coastline, a project designed to protect residents from future floods. Instead, the city can feel like a fortress where the concrete wall obscures any view of the ocean. On a chilly night in March, a howling wind drowned out any sound of lapping waves. In the darkness, only a slither of the sea was visible above the slabs of concrete, its serene surface concealing the noiseless churn of water below.

Yoshihito Sasaki, 70, can see the ocean from his front room, but he has long ago given up fishing or taking walks by the sea. He moved into his current home after the tsunami swept away his old house here, where he lived with his wife and two sons.

In March 2011, Sasaki was a few weeks shy of retirement, working as a principal in an elementary school built on higher ground in Hirota, a fishing village half an hour’s drive from his family’s home.

After making sure that all of his students were safe, and learning that his older son, Yoichi, had survived, Sasaki began searching for the rest of his family. He had already assumed the worst about his other son, 28-year-old Jinya, who had been a “hikikomori” for a decade, a Japanese term for people who withdraw from society. When the disaster hit, Jinya hadn’t left their house for two years.

“I thought maybe my wife had survived, so when I went to shelters, I asked them if they saw a woman who had lost her mind,” Sasaki said quietly, averting his eyes. He knew that leaving her son behind in the tsunami would have destroyed Mikiko, his wife.

Sasaki was unable to find Mikiko in any of the evacuation centers. Her body was recovered weeks later.

Later, he learned that his wife had tried to coax their son out of the house as the water kept rising. Jinya refused to leave, saying until the end that he didn’t want to see other people. Mikiko finally ran out of the house, taking shelter on a neighbor’s roof with their elder son. From there, they watched the wave swallow their home.

Sasaki took off his glasses and busied himself with a pile of newspaper clippings on his table. A warm orange light filled the room, which was still cluttered with boxes his surviving son left behind when he moved out in December.

For almost a decade after the disaster, Sasaki and his son lived together but never discussed the day of the tsunami. The two men finally talked over sushi a few months ago, when his son was preparing to move away.

“I asked my son what my wife said to him at the end,” Sasaki said. The last time his son saw her, she was holding onto a piece of wreckage in a black tide, yelling out to him. “He told me that she was screaming for him to live,” he said, sighing. “She told him to survive.”

Yoichi held onto wreckage and drifted for hours in the tsunami’s waters before he was finally rescued.

After the tsunami, Sasaki bought dozens of books about his late son’s condition, out of regret that he had not done more to support his late wife. Turning on the fluorescent light in his room, Sasaki pulled out a folder full of newsletters that he has written in the past decade about the hikikomori. He also moderates a support group for parents every month where he listens to others vent and cry about their reclusive children.

Even so, Sasaki is plagued by regret. Several times, he repeats that his older son may still blame him for not doing more to help his wife with Jinya.

“I thought maybe time would solve things, but I know now that’s not the case. There are things you want to forget but can’t,” he said, with a pause. “Some memories, those key memories in your mind, are actually more vivid now.”

A MOTHER HAUNTED BY LOSS

In Ishinomaki, a coastal city in neighboring Miyagi prefecture, nearly 3,200 people died in the disaster. One of them was Airi, Mika Sato’s daughter, who loved playing with her little sister and wanted to be a TV presenter when she grew up.

Airi was at a local kindergarten when the earthquake struck. Shortly after, teachers put Airi and four others on a bus, which took them down the hill and closer to the coast.

It took three days for Sato to find Airi. She walked through a field of rubble where thin plumes of smoke still smoldered between bits of plywood and metal. One of the other parents eventually found the charred remains of a yellow school bus hidden under what had been the metal roof of a house.

“By the time we found them, all that was left of her was as small as a baby’s,” said Sato, cradling her arms as if she were holding her daughter. “We were so afraid the wind would blow them away.”

Sato said it wasn’t until later that she heard from neighbors that they could hear children calling for help until midnight, hours after a 28-foot tsunami swept into Ishinomaki.

Sato and other parents kept asking the school for an explanation of what exactly happened on the day of the tsunami. Five months after the disaster, Sato and three other families filed a lawsuit against the operator of the kindergarten.

“We thought we would find the truth in court,” said Sato, 46. “It was completely different from what we expected; we didn’t get anywhere near the truth.” Sato had hoped that the school would explain why it had decided to put the children on a bus toward the coast after a massive quake, but school staff repeated in court that they had not heard the tsunami siren, she said.

Sato and other plaintiffs reached a settlement with the school in 2014. As part of the settlement, the school took legal responsibility and promised to provide a “heartfelt apology” to the families, Sato and her lawyer, Kenji Kamada, said. Though the school has sent flowers, Sato said she has never received a formal apology.

A lawyer who represented the school, which is now closed, said it continued to send flowers to the families involved in the case every year. He declined to comment further on the matter, referring questions on the details of the settlement to the plaintiffs.

Sighing, Sato walked to a memorial built along a busy coastal road, close to where she had found her daughter. Taking off her mask, she touched Airi’s name carved into stone.

“The anger doesn’t go away,” she said, adding that as a naturally shy person, she had never wanted to be a public figure embroiled in such a court case. “Our precious daughter died and the fact that …,” she started to say, before a local man approached her, saying he recognized her from TV interviews.

After reminiscing about the disaster, the man told her it was shameful that people went to court for money after the disaster.

“Didn’t you get like 300 million yen?” the man asked.

“Actually no, we didn’t,” Sato answered calmly, before the man cut her off.

“We all suffered and it’s time to move on,” he mumbled before walking away.

Afterward, Sato said most locals had been supportive, but others believe survivors like her shouldn’t have pursued their cases in court. The family members of four of the children who died on the bus shared a settlement of 60 million yen ($550,000), Sato’s lawyer said. Civil lawsuits like the one filed by Sato are much less common in Japan compared to in the United States.

“I’ve gotten kind of used to it by now,” Sato said sadly, walking back to her parked car. She wondered aloud how the man would react if he had lost his own child or grandchild in such a devastating disaster.

“Some people say heartless things, but people who don’t understand will never understand, no matter what you say.”

LETTERS TO A DEAD HUSBAND

Across Japan’s northeast region, more than 2,500 people are still reported missing from the disaster. In Iwate Prefecture, police officers hold monthly walk-in sessions at local shopping malls and community centers for families who haven’t stopped searching for their loved ones. At these meetings, police officers take down identifying details about the missing and sometimes collect DNA samples from family members.

The lack of remains and the difficulty of the search have prolonged the sense of limbo for some families.

Three months after the tsunami, Sachiko Kumagai began writing letters to Migaku, her husband, a beloved local fisheries worker who went missing after he left his hillside home on the day of the disaster. He was 71, and she was 69. Her letters, hundreds of them, usually written with a magic marker, start with the weather and a description of the breakfast she had set out for him, and are interspersed with her gnawing questions about where he might be.

In several, Kumagai responds as her husband.

“Mama-chan, I won’t be able to return even if you keep brooding over it … I’ll be waiting for you, you can do it, you can.”

Hitoshi Tsurizaki, 71, first met Kumagai when he was volunteering after the disaster in Rikuzentakata. In an effort to help her process her grief, Tsurizaki offered to type up Kumagai’s letters and bound them in books for her.

“I think there are a lot of people who wish things could go back to how they were, which we know is not possible,” he said. A lack of conclusive proof that their family members had died pushed some to fall into a state of magical thinking, he said, allowing them to grasp at all sorts of explanations for their loved ones’ sudden banishment.

“If typing up those letters helped her in any way process his passing, then I’m grateful,” he said.

Makoto Kumagai, the couple’s 51-year-old son, said he didn’t understand his parents’ bond until he read some of his mother’s letters.

In 2017, six years after the tsunami, Kumagai finally filed her husband’s death certificate. Kumagai died a year later. In one of her final letters, she seemed resigned to her loss.

“Good morning Migaku-san. Not many days left in the year. Seems like we’ll finish out another year without finding you … Wouldn’t it be a miracle if you wander back to the Ono Bay? I’ve heard miracles exist, but it doesn’t seem to in this disaster.”"

Inside, Kazuyoshi Sasaki carefully dials his late wife Miwako’s cellphone number, bending his large frame and cradling the handset.

He explains how he searched for her for days after the devastating earthquake and tsunami a decade ago, visiting evacuation centres and makeshift morgues, returning at night to the rubble of their home.

“It all happened in an instant, I can’t forget it even now,” he says, weeping. “I sent you a message telling you where I was, but you didn’t check it.”

“When I came back to the house and looked up at the sky, there were thousands of stars, it was like looking at a jewel box,” the 67-year old says. “I cried and cried and knew then that so many people must have died.”

Sasaki’s wife was one of nearly 20,000 people in northeastern Japan killed by the disaster that struck on March 11, 2011.

Many survivors say the unconnected phone line in the town of Otsuchi helps them keep in touch with their loved ones and gives them some solace as they grapple with their grief.

I’M LONELY

Earlier in the day, Sachiko Okawa calls Toichiro, her late husband to whom she was married for 44 years. She asks him what he has been doing with his days since he was swept away by the tsunami a decade ago.

“I’m lonely,” she says finally, her voice cracking, and asks Toichiro to watch over their family. “Bye for now, I’ll be back soon.”

Okawa says she sometimes feels like she can hear Toichiro on the other end of the line.

“It makes me feel a little better.”

The 76-year-old, who learned about the hillside garden from friends, often brings her two grandsons here so they can also talk to their grandfather.

“Grandpa, it’s been 10 years already and I’m going to be in middle school soon,” says Daina, Okawa’s 12-year-old grandson, as they all squeeze into the phone box. “There’s this new virus that’s killing lots of people and that’s why we’re wearing masks. But we’re all doing well.”

PHONE OF THE WIND

The phone booth was built by Itaru Sasaki, who owns the garden in Otsuchi, a town some 500 km (310 miles) northeast of Tokyo, a few months before the disaster, after he lost his cousin to cancer.

“There are many people who were not able to say goodbye,” he says. “There are families who wish they could have said something at the end, had they known they wouldn’t get to speak again.”

The phone now attracts thousands of visitors from all over Japan. It is not only used by tsunami survivors, but also by people who have lost relatives to sickness and suicide. Dubbed “the phone of the wind”, it recently inspired a film.

A few months ago, Sasaki says he was approached by organisers who want to set up similar phones in Britain and Poland that would allow people to call relatives they had lost in the coronavirus pandemic.

“Just like a disaster, the pandemic came suddenly and when a death is sudden, the grief a family experiences is also much larger,” the 76-year-old says.

I’M SO GLAD WE MET

Like thousands of others in devastated coastal communities, Kazuyoshi Sasaki, the councilman, lost not only his wife but many other relatives and friends in the disaster.

He had known and loved Miwako for most of his life.

He first confessed his love to her when they were both in junior high school, an offer she promptly rejected. It took another 10 years for the two to begin dating. Eventually, they married and had four children.

Sasaki explains to his wife that he recently moved out of temporary housing and that their youngest son is now building a new home where he can live with their grandchildren.

Before hanging up, Sasaki tells Miwako that a recent health checkup showed he had lost weight.

“I’ll take care of myself,” he promises her as a strong wind blows outside. “I’m so glad we met, thank you, we’re all doing what we can, talk soon.”"

WELLINGTON, New Zealand-One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history triggered tsunami warnings and forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate coastal areas on Friday.

Small tsunami waves were seen, but little damage was apparent hours later.

The magnitude 8.1 quake in the Kermadec Islands region about 1,000 kilometers from New Zealand's two main islands was the largest in a series of temblors over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.

The tsunami threat caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground.

Residents recorded videos of small wave surges in some places, including at Tokomaru Bay near Gisborne. In the afternoon, the National Emergency Management Agency said the threat had passed and people could return to their homes, although they should continue avoiding beaches.

One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking. ""Hope everyone is OK out there,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.

After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters.

Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.

""They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,"" she said. ""I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.""

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter in Tonga, other South Pacific islands, and Latin America's Pacific coast.

South America alerted

Chilean authorities ordered people off beaches due to the potential for a tsunami along the nation's long coastline. Guatemala issued a tsunami alert, and authorities in El Salvador ordered people to take precautions in recreational activities. Mexico said there was no threat.

Waves of 30 centimeters above tide levels were measured by ocean gauges off the Pacific nation of Vanuatu, off Gisborne, New Zealand, and off an Australian island. Smaller waves were measured elsewhere in the South Pacific.

The US Geological Survey said the strongest quake was centered near the Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 km.

Although the islands are uninhabited, New Zealand has built research and accommodation facilities there and often had scientists cycling through until the coronavirus hit last year and it halted the program.

But a large group of more than 100 people including scientists and students was due to stay on the islands this week, until they were forced to cancel because of a virus lockdown in Auckland, said a spokesperson from the Department of Conservation.

The USGS said in a report the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded along the fault line, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.

It started with an earthquake. It resulted in 465,000 evacuations, $360 billion in economic losses and increased radiation levels in Tokyo, 140 miles away.

As with most disasters, several things had to go wrong to produce such a catastrophic outcome. Below is a detailed account of how the devastation unfolded.

March 11, 2011: An Earthquake Precipitates Crisis

2:46 pm: The westward moving Pacific Plate, an oceanic tectonic plate, lurches downwards beneath the North American plate, causing an earthquake 43 miles off the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan’s most populous island. The earthquake has a magnitude of 9.1, making it the largest earthquake in Japan’s history—and one of the five most powerful earthquakes globally recorded since modern record-keeping began.

3:27 p.m.: The earthquake sets off a tsunami. The first wave arrives at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in the form of a 13-foot-high wave, which is deflected by a sea wall built to withstand waves up to 33 feet high.

3:35 p.m.: A second wave, this one over 50 feet high, breaches the wall. It destroys seawater pumps, drowns power panels that distribute energy to water pumps, and surges into basements where backup generators are housed. In five of the six reactors, AC power is lost; without the power, water pumps can’t provide the steady flow of cool water to the reactors’ intensely hot cores. Without the regular flow of cooling water, a meltdown will inevitably follow.

3:37 p.m.: With flooding having destroyed the generator’s backup batteries, Unit 1 loses DC power as well. The control room for Units 1 and 2 goes dark, depriving power plant operators any capacity for monitoring the two reactors.

Just before 6 p.m.: A work crew goes to the 4th floor of the Unit 1 reactor building without protective clothing. Their dosimeters read off-the-scale levels of radiation, indicating that the core of Unit 1 is exposed and its fuel rods ruptured.

7:03 p.m.: Prime Minister Naoto Kan declares a nuclear emergency.

9:00 p.m.: The Japanese government issues evacuation orders for the several thousand residents living within a 1.9-mile (3 kilometer) radius of the power plant.

March 12: Evacuation Area Expands, the Roof Blows

Shortly before 6 a.m.: Prime Minister Kan decides to go to Fukushima. He orders authorities to widen the evacuation zone to 6.2 miles (10 kilometers). With the loss of coolant, temperature and pressure builds inside the reactors.

10:09 a.m.: The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) announces they have vented some steam from Unit 1 in an attempt to lower the temperature and pressure. The venting means that some radioactive material has been released into the air.

10:58 a.m.: Unit 2, it is announced, has likewise been vented.

3:36 p.m.: A hydrogen explosion blows the roof off Unit 1, collapsing concrete walls and leaving behind only the steel framework. Four workers are injured in the explosion. In addition to the harm to the workers, the explosion damages electric cable that workers had been laying for the purposes of restoring power to Units 1 and 2. The explosion also damages fire hoses that workers had arranged, hampering the plant’s ability to deliver coolant to the reactor core.

Just before 6:30 p.m.: The evacuation area is expanded to a 12.4- mile (20 kilometer) radius.

8:20 p.m.: TEPCO begins injecting seawater into Unit 1, as a substitute coolant. The decision to use seawater is the death knell to Reactor 1: Unlike fresh water, it irreparably corrodes pumps and pipelines. Around the same time, Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) detects harmful radiation levels of cesium 137 and iodine 131 near the plant.

6:23 a.m.: A NISA official announces that the emergency cooling system in the Unit 3 reactor has failed.

10:05 p.m.: TEPCO begins injecting seawater into Unit 3.

10:09 p.m.: TEPCO announces a plan to inject seawater into Unit 2, the first acknowledgement of emergency at that reactor.

March 14: Explosions Continue

11:01 a.m.: There’s a hydrogen explosion at the Unit 3 reactor. 11 workers are injured, and the building’s structure is severely damaged.

March 15

6:14 a.m.: A hydrogen explosion occurs at the Unit 2 reactor.

Throughout the day: Seawater pumping continues at Units 1, 2 and 3. Near the plant, radiation levels are measured at 400 millisieverts per hour. By comparison, the average person is exposed to about 2.4 millisieverts of radiation per year, meaning that radiation at Fukushima is 1.46 million times stronger than it would be in an average environment.

March 17

The military begins using helicopters to dump seawater onto Unit 3, where radiation levels are at 17 millisieverts per hour.

March 19

Replacement diesel generators are successfully implemented at Units 5 and 6, pumping water back into those reactor cores. Elsewhere, the extent of damage becomes clearer: Milk and water in the greater Fukushima Prefecture show excessively high levels of radioactive iodine.

March 20: Things Start to Stabilize

Temperatures stabilize at Units 5 and 6, bringing about the safe harbor of “cold shutdown” conditions. Electrical power is restored to Unit 2.

March 22

Eleven days after the initial disaster, electrical power is restored to the control rooms of Units 1 and 2. In the wastewater just south of the plant, radioactive iodine is measured at 126.7 times higher than the legal limit.

March 25

The Unit 1 Reactor temperature is brought down to 204.5 degrees Celsius, safely inside its design limits. The Japanese government advises those residents who are between 20 and 30 kilometers away from the the plant to voluntarily evacuate the area.

Seawater that’s tested near the plant has 1,250 times the legal limit of iodine 131.

April 11

A new earthquake, of magnitude 7.0, rocks eastern Japan. For 50 minutes, Fukushima loses power, preventing cooling water from reaching Units 1, 2, and 3.

April 12: Atomic Disaster Declaration

The International Atomic Energy Agency rates the Fukushima Crisis a disaster magnitude of 7, the highest of their scale.

May 11

Evacuees who have abandoned homes within 20 kilometers of Fukushima are given two hours to return for important documents or belongings left behind in the initial haste of their evacuation.

""Japan utilized data from several hundred years of tsunami records in its planning, which seemed perfectly reasonable, then was hit by a once-a-millennium tsunami. So, we're using a thousand-year scenario as the baseline for our new maps, hoping to avoid the tragic loss of life experienced there.

""While damaging tsunamis are infrequent in California, if you're on the coast, you need to be aware of this potential hazard,'' Bohlen added.

In the Miyagi prefecture in Japan, a man has gone on almost 500 dives searching for the remains of his wife, who was one of 2,500 unaccounted for in his town.

Changes to the existing Los Angeles County inundation map are modest, with the inundation potential upgraded in some areas and downgraded in others, noted Rick Wilson, head of the CGS Tsunami Program.

The CGS and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services have advised several communities with isolated pockets of population and few roads for evacuation -- such as in Alamitos Bay, Marina del Rey, and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles -- about their increased inundation areas.

""A large tsunami could flood sizeable areas of Marina del Rey and Long Beach to an elevation of 15 feet,'' Wilson said. ""Flood levels for the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach could reach elevations of 12 to 15 feet, which would inundate almost all of the land in the ports and some of the surrounding communities. Local officials have indicated that if both ports were shut down for one day, the economic loss to the county would be over $1 billion.''

The county's beaches can have over a million visitors per mile of beach during summer weekends and holidays, posing an evacuation challenge.

According to the scenario used by CGS, the first surges of a worst-case tsunami would reach the Los Angeles coastline in about six hours.

""That may seem like a lot of time, but it will take an hour or so for the National Tsunami Warning Center to issue a warning to California and then additional time for local authorities to determine whether an evacuation is necessary,'' Wilson said. ""The bottom line is, if you're near the coast and feel strong shaking from a local earthquake or get an official notification to evacuate, move inland as soon as possible.''

More than 150 tsunamis have hit California's shore since 1800. Most were barely noticeable, but a few have caused fatalities or significant damage -- most recently the 2011 tsunami that not only devastated Japan but caused $100 million of damage to California ports and harbors.

The most destructive tsunami to hit California occurred March 28, 1964. Several surges reaching 21 feet high swept into Crescent City four hours after a magnitude 9.2 earthquake in Alaska, killing 12 people and leveling much of the town's business district.

""I want everyone to know that unexpected disasters can happen. I think it is our job as people who experienced the (tsunami) to share that,"" said Fumio Ito, head of public relations at Minami Sanriku Hotel Kanyo and one of nine staff members who lead the daily hour-long bus tours.

The bus stops at a former school that was damaged by the tsunami, a disaster prevention center where 43 workers died and a former wedding ceremony hall.

Since the tours began, they have had about 400,000 participants, some repeat visitors, according to the hotel.

""He taught me a different perspective,"" said Chieko Yoshida, who took a tour given by Ito. ""To hear the voice of someone who experienced this in reality is very important.""

Ito was at a customer's home when the quake hit. He immediately began making his way to the hotel but soon found it impossible as the water began to rise.

""I could see that my house had probably washed away. There was nothing in front of me,"" said Ito, who lost three friends in the tsunami. ""I had nowhere to be safe, so I went up into the mountains."""

Tokyo, March 9 (Jiji Press)--The number of missing people from the March 2011 major earthquake and tsunami, which mainly struck the Tohoku region of northeastern Japan, stood at 2,525 in six prefectures as of March 1 this year, the National Police Agency said Tuesday.

Of the total, 1,215 are from Miyagi Prefecture, 1,111 from Iwate Prefecture and 196 from Fukushima Prefecture. The three prefectures, all in Tohoku, were hit hardest by the March 11 disaster.

Meanwhile, the death toll from the quake and tsunami came to 15,900 in 12 prefectures as of the beginning of this month, including a woman whose remains were identified in Miyagi on Thursday. The number of deaths stood at 9,543 in Miyagi, 4,675 in Iwate and 1,614 in Fukushima.

Between March last year and February this year, three remains were identified as being those of people who went missing in the disaster, with two of the remains in Miyagi and one in Iwate. All three bodies were discovered in 2011, but had not been identified.

In the identification process, police studied the physical characteristics of the remains and analyzed their mitochondrial DNA, which is maternally inherited. Based on accumulated data, the police also used the method known as ""mapping pointing,"" in which the sites of the remains' discovery are used to estimate the locations in which the victims experienced the disaster.
