No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Study participants

Previously enrolled study participants1 were asked to return for a 6-month follow-up visit at the Rockefeller University Hospital from 31 August through to 16 October 2020. Eligible participants were adults aged 18–76 years and were either diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT–PCR (cases) or were close contacts (for example, members of the same household, coworkers or members of same religious community) of someone who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT–PCR (contacts). Close contacts without seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by serological assays (described in ‘High-throughput automated serology assays’) were not included in the subsequent analysis. Most study participants were residents of the greater New York city tri-state region and were asked to return approximately six months after the time of onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Participants presented to the Rockefeller University Hospital for blood sample collection and were asked to recall the symptoms and severity of clinical presentation during the acute (first six weeks) and the convalescent (seven weeks until second study visit) phase of COVID-19, respectively. The severity of acute infection was assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) ‘Ordinal Clinical Progression/Improvement Scale’ (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-therapeutic-trial-synopsis). Shortness of breath was assessed through the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale43. Participants who presented with persistent symptoms attributable to COVID-19 were identified on the basis of chronic shortness of breath or fatigue, deficit in athletic ability and/or three or more additional long-term symptoms such as persistent unexplained fevers, chest pain, new-onset cardiac sequalae, arthralgias, impairment of concentration or mental acuity, impairment of sense of smell or taste, neuropathy or cutaneous findings3,4. All participants at Rockefeller University provided written informed consent before participation in the study and the study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice. Clinical data collection and management were carried out using the software iRIS by iMedRIS. The study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and the protocol for studies with human participants was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Rockefeller University.

Gastrointestinal biopsy cohort

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can persist in the gastrointestinal tract, we recruited a cohort of 14 individuals with prior diagnosis of and recovery from COVID-19 illness. Eligible participants included adults, 18–76 years of age who were previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by RT–PCR or through a combination of clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19 plus evidence of seroconversion, and presented to the gastroenterology clinics of Mount Sinai Hospital. Endoscopic procedures were performed for clinically indicated conditions as detailed in Supplementary Table 7. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of the endoscopic procedures and negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasal-swab PCR (cycle threshold (C t ) cut-off < 38).

The CLIA-certified laboratory of the Mount Sinai Health System validated the laboratory-developed nasopharyngeal-swab real-time RT–PCR test according to the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center validation procedure for SARS-CoV-244. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The biopsy-related studies were approved by the Mount Sinai Ethics Committee/IRB (IRB 16-0583, ‘The impact of viral infections and their treatment on gastrointestinal immune cells’).

SARS-CoV-2 saliva PCR test

The SARS-CoV-2 PCR method for saliva samples was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Rockefeller University Clinical Genomics Laboratory. This laboratory-developed test has been authorized by New York state under an emergency use authorization for use by authorized laboratories. Saliva was collected into guanidine thiocyanate buffer as previously described45. RNA was extracted using either a column-based (Qiagen QIAmp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit, 61904) or a magnetic-bead-based method as previously described46. Reverse-transcribed cDNA was amplified using primers and probes validated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or by Columbia University Personalized Medicine Genomics Laboratory, respectively, and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration under the emergency use authorization. Viral RNA was considered detected if the C t for two viral primer and probe combinations was < 40.

Blood sample processing and storage

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by gradient centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen in the presence of FCS and DMSO. Heparinized plasma and serum samples were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C or below. Before experiments, aliquots of plasma samples were heat-inactivated (56 °C for 1 h) and then stored at 4 °C.

High-throughput automated serology assays

Plasma samples from 80 out of 87 participants were tested by high-throughput automated serology assays. The Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay was performed on Roche Cobas e411 (Roche Diagnostics). The Elecsys anti‐SARS‐CoV-2 assay uses a recombinant protein representing the N antigen for the determination of antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2. This assay received emergency use authorization approval from the US Food and Drug Administration6. The Pylon COVID-19 IgG and IgM assays were used to measure plasma IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Plasma samples were assayed on the Pylon 3D analyser (ET HealthCare) as previously described5. This assay was implemented clinically as a laboratory-developed test under New York State Department of Health regulations. In brief, the assay was performed using a unitized test strip containing wells with predispensed reagents. The COVID-19 reagent contains biotinylated recombinant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD and trace amounts of N protein as antigens that bind IgG and IgM, respectively. The cut-off values for both Pylon assays were determined using the mean of non-COVID-19 samples plus 6 s.d. The results of a sample are reported in the form of a cut-off index or an index value, which were determined by the instrument readout of the test sample divided by instrument readout at cut-off.

ELISAs

ELISAs47,48 to evaluate antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 N (Sino Biological 40588-V08B), RBD and additional RBDs were performed by coating of high-binding 96-half-well plates (Corning 3690) with 50 μl per well of a 1 μg ml−1 protein solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer (1× PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated with 170 μl per well blocking buffer (1× PBS with 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies or plasma samples were added in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples were assayed at a 1:67 starting dilution and 7 additional threefold serial dilutions. Monoclonal antibodies were tested at 10 μg ml−1 starting concentration and 10 additional fourfold serial dilutions. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then incubated with anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Immuno Research 109-036-088 109-035-129 and Sigma A0295) in blocking buffer at a 1:5,000 dilution (IgM and IgG) or 1:3,000 dilution (IgA). Plates were developed by addition of the HRP substrate, TMB (ThermoFisher) for 10 min (plasma samples) or 4 min (monoclonal antibodies), then the developing reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl 1 M H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech) with Omega and Omega MARS software for analysis. For plasma samples, a positive control (plasma from participant COV72, diluted 66.6-fold and 7 additional threefold serial dilutions in PBS) was added to every assay plate for validation. The average of its signal was used for normalization of all of the other values on the same plate with Excel software before calculating the AUC using Prism v.8.4 (GraphPad). For monoclonal antibodies, the EC 50 was determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism v.8.4).

Expression of RBD proteins

Mammalian expression vectors encoding the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MN985325.1; S protein residues 319–539) and eight additional mutant RBD proteins (E484K, Q493R, R346S, N493K, N440K, V367F, A475V, S477N and V483A) with an N-terminal human IL-2 or Mu phosphatase signal peptide were previously described49.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped reporter virus

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles were generated as previously described1,8. In brief, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3ΔEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 . For generation of RBD-mutant pseudoviruses, pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 carrying either of the following spike mutations was used instead of its wild-type counterpart: Q493R, R346S or E484G50. Particles were collected at 48 h after transfection, filtered and stored at −80 °C.

Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay

Fourfold serially diluted plasma from individuals convalescent from COVID-19, or monoclonal antibodies, were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was subsequently incubated with 293T ACE2 cells for 48 h, after which cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5× reagent (Promega). Nanoluc luciferase activity in lysates was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with the Glomax Navigator (Promega). The obtained relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of plasma or monoclonal antibodies. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration for plasma (NT 50 ) or monoclonal antibodies (IC 50 ) was determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression (least squares regression method without weighting; constraints: top = 1, bottom = 0) (GraphPad Prism).

High-dimensional data analysis of flow cytometry data

High-dimensional viSNE and FlowSOM data analysis and visualization of flow cytometry data were performed on B cells using the Cytobank platform (https://cytobank.org). viSNE analysis was performed using equal sampling of 4,893 cells from each FCS file, with 75,00 iterations, a perplexity of 30 and a theta of 0.5. The following markers were used to generate viSNE maps: IgA, CD305, TGFb-RII, CD138, CD10, CD272, IgD, CD24, CD21, CD95, HLA-DR, IgG, CD279, CD38, IgM, CD274, CD27, CD23, CXCR5, CD32, CD86, CD40, CD85j, CD11c and CXCR3. Resulting viSNE maps were fed into the FlowSOM clustering algorithm51. The self-organizing map was generated using hierarchical consensus clustering on the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding axes.

Heat map visualization

Heat maps to display column-scaled z-scores of mean fluorescence intensity for individual FlowSOM clusters according to marker expression were created using the R function pheatmap.

Biotinylation of viral protein for use in flow cytometry

Purified and Avi-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD was biotinylated using the Biotin-Protein Ligase-BIRA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Avidity) as previously described1. Ovalbumin (Sigma, A5503-1G) was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific). Biotinylated ovalbumin was conjugated to streptavidin–BV711 (BD biosciences, 563262) and RBD to streptavidin–PE (BD Biosciences, 554061) and streptavidin–AF647 (Biolegend, 405237)1.

Single-cell sorting by flow cytometry

Single-cell sorting by flow cytometry was previously described1. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched for B cells by negative selection using a pan-B-cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-101-638). The enriched B cells were incubated in FACS buffer (1× PBS, 2% FCS, 1 mM EDTA) with the following anti-human antibodies (all at 1:200 dilution): anti-CD20–PECy7 (BD Biosciences, 335793), anti-CD3–APC–eFluro 780 (Invitrogen, 47-0037-41), anti-CD8–APC–eFluor 780 (Invitrogen, 47-0086-42), anti-CD16–APC–eFluor 780 (Invitrogen, 47-0168-41), anti-CD14–APC–eFluor 780 (Invitrogen, 47-0149-42), as well as Zombie NIR (BioLegend, 423105) and fluorophore-labelled RBD and ovalbumin (Ova) for 30 min on ice. Single CD3−CD8−CD14−CD16−CD20+Ova−RBD–PE+RBD–AF647+ B cells were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates containing 4 μl of lysis buffer (0.5× PBS, 10 mM DTT, 3,000 units per ml RNasin ribonuclease inhibitors (Promega, N2615)) per well using a FACS Aria III and FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson) for acquisition and FlowJo for analysis. The sorted cells were frozen on dry ice, and then stored at −80 °C or immediately used for subsequent RNA reverse transcription.

Antibody sequencing, cloning and expression

Antibodies were identified and sequenced as previously described1. In brief, RNA from single cells was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, 18080-044) and the cDNA stored at −20 °C or used for subsequent amplification of the variable IGH, IGL and IGK genes by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector. Amplicons from the first PCR reaction were used as templates for sequence- and ligation-independent cloning into antibody expression vectors. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies and Fabs were produced and purified as previously described1.

Computational analyses of antibody sequences

Antibody sequences were trimmed on the basis of quality and annotated using Igblastn v.1.14. with IMGT domain delineation system. Annotation was performed systematically using Change-O toolkit v.0.4.54052. Heavy and light chains derived from the same cell were paired, and clonotypes were assigned on the basis of their V and J genes using in-house R and Perl scripts (Extended Data Fig. 5). All scripts and the data used to process antibody sequences are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/stratust/igpipeline).

The frequency distributions of human V genes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from this study were compared to 131,284,220 previously generated IgH and IgL sequences53 and downloaded from cAb-Rep54 (a database of human shared BCR clonotypes available at https://cab-rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/). On the basis of the 82 distinct V genes that make up the 1,703 analysed sequences from immunoglobulin repertoire of the three participants present in this study, we selected the IgH and IgL sequences from the database that are partially coded by the same V genes and counted them according to the constant region. The frequencies shown in (Extended Data Fig. 5) are relative to the source and isotype analysed. We used the two-sided binomial test to check whether the number of sequences belonging to a specific IGHV or IGLV gene in the repertoire is different according to the frequency of the same IGV gene in the database. Adjusted P values were calculated using the false-discovery rate correction. In Extended Data Figs. 5, 6, significant differences are denoted with asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001).

Nucleotide somatic hypermutation and CDR3 length were determined using in-house R and Perl scripts. For somatic hypermutations, IGHV and IGLV nucleotide sequences were aligned against their closest germlines using Igblastn and the number of differences were considered nucleotide mutations. The average mutations for V genes was calculated by dividing the sum of all nucleotide mutations across all participants by the number of sequences used for the analysis. To calculate the GRAVY scores of hydrophobicity55 we used the Guy H. R. Hydrophobicity scale based on free energy of transfer (kcal per mole)56 implemented by the R package Peptides (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Peptides). We used 532 heavy-chain CDR3 amino acid sequences from this study and 22,654,256 IGH CDR3 sequences from the public database of memory B cell receptor sequences57. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine whether the GRAVY scores were normally distributed. The GRAVY scores from all 532 IGH CDR3 amino acid sequences from this study were used to perform the test and 5,000 GRAVY scores of the sequences from the public database were randomly selected. The Shapiro–Wilk P values were 6.896 × 10−3 and 2.217 × 10−6 for sequences from this study and the public database, respectively, indicating that the data were not normally distributed. Therefore, we used the two-tailed Wilcoxon nonparametric test to compare the samples, which indicated a difference in hydrophobicity distribution (P = 5 × 10−6) (Extended Data Fig. 6h).

A heat map of log 2 -transformed relative fold change in EC 50 against the indicated RBD mutants for antibody clonal pairs obtained at 1.3 and 6.2 months (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 7k) was created with R pheatmap package (https://github.com/raivokolde/pheatmap) using Euclidean distance and Ward.2 clustering method.

Biopsies and immunofluorescence

Endoscopically obtained mucosal biopsies were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections (5 μm) were cut, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated in graded alcohol and PBS. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in target retrieval solution (DAKO, S1699) using a commercial pressure cooker. Slides were then cooled to room temperature, washed in PBS and permeabilized for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum (Invitrogen, 50062Z) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with a combination of primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed 3 times in PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody and DAPI (1 μg ml−1) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS three times and then mounted with Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 1798425). Controls included omitting primary antibody (no primary 995 control) or substituting primary antibodies with nonreactive antibodies of the same isotype (isotype control). A Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope and digital SLR camera (Nikon, DS-Qi2) was used to visualize and image the tissue.

The antibody used to stain sections for N protein was raised in rabbits against SARS-CoV N and is cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 N protein58 (Supplementary Table 8).

SARS-CoV-2 PCR from intestinal biopsies

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in the gastrointestinal tract, we isolated RNA from endoscopically obtained mucosal biopsies using Direct-zol miniprep kit (Zymo research, R2050). Reverse-transcribed cDNA was amplified using 2019-nCov Ruo Kit (IDT) to detect viral nucleocapsid genomic RNA. Amplification of subgenomic nucleocapsid RNA was done using following primers and probe: sgLeadSARSCov2_F 5′-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3′28, wtN_R4 5′-GGTGAACCAAGACGCAGTAT-3′, wtN_P4 5′-/56-FAM/TAACCAGAA/ZEN/TGGAGAACGCAGTGGG/3IABkFQ/-3′.

Quantitative PCR was performed using QuantTect probe PCR kit (Qiagen, 204345) under following conditions: 95 °C 15 s, 95 °C 15 s and 60 °C 1 min using the Applied Biosystem QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Viral RNA was considered detected if the C t for viral primer and probe combinations was < 40. Samples from positive wells were column-purified and presence of N1 sequences additionally verified by Sanger sequencing.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by probe proximity ligation

Probes were designed with a 20–25 nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Probes were assessed by NCBI BLAST to exclude off target binding to other cellular transcripts. IDT OligoAnalyzer (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used to identify probe pairs with similar thermodynamic properties; melting temperature 45–60 °C, GC content of 40–55% and low self-complementary. The 3′ end of each one of the probes used for proximity ligation signal amplification is designed with a partially complementary sequence to the 61-bp-long backbone and partially to the 21-bp insert (Supplementary Table 8). Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) probes were designed with a complementary 3′ end to the biotin detection probe (Supplementary Table 8).

Paraffin-embedded samples were sectioned at 10 μm. Sections were deparaffinized using 100% xylene, 5 min at room temperature, repeated twice. Slides were rinsed in 100% ethanol, 1 min at room temperature, twice, and air-dried. Endogenous peroxidase activity was eliminated by treating the samples with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, 10 min at room temperature followed by washing with DEPC-treated water. Samples were incubated 15 min at 95–100 °C in antigen retrieval solution (ACDBio) rinsed in DEPC-treated water and dehydrated in 100% ethanol, 3 min at room temperature and air-dried. Tissue sections were permeabilized 30 min at 40 °C using RNAscope protease plus solution (ACDBio) and rinsed in DEPC-treated water.

Hybridization was performed overnight at 40 °C in a buffer based on DEPC-treated water containing 2× SSC, 20% formamide (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2.5% (v/v) polyvinylsulfonic acid, 20 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (New England Biolabs), 40 U ml−1 RNasin (Promega), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich), 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 μg ml−1 yeast RNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA probes dissolved in DEPC-treated water were added at a final concentration of 100 nM (Integrated DNA Technologies). Samples were washed briefly and incubated in a buffer containing 2× SSC, 20% formamide, 40 U ml−1 RNasin at 40 °C and then washed four times (5 min each) in wash buffer, PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 4 U ml−1 RNasin (Promega). Slides were then incubated with 100 nM insert and backbone oligonucleotides in PBS, 1× SSC, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 μg ml−1 yeast RNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 40 U ml−1 RNasin at 37 °C. After four washes, tissues were incubated at 37 °C with 0.1 U μl−1 T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 250 μg ml−1 BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 40 U ml−1 RNasin, followed by incubation with 0.1 U μl−1 phi29 DNA polymerase in 50 mM Tris–HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 250 μM dNTPs, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Tween 20, 40 U ml−1 RNasin pH 7.5 at 30 °C. Slides were washed and endogenous biotin was blocked using Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rolling cycle amplicons were identified using a biotin-labelled DNA probe at a concentration of 5 nM at 37 °C in PBS, 1× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg ml−1 yeast RNA. After washing, samples were incubated with 1:100 diluted streptavidin–HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS, 60 min at room temperature followed by washing. Fluorescent labelling was accomplished using Alexa Fluor 647 Tyramide SuperBoostKit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear counterstaining (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and samples were mounted in ProLong gold antifade (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by smFISH

Hybridization was performed overnight at 40 °C in a buffer based on DEPC-treated water containing 2× SSC, 20% formamide (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 2.5% (v/v) polyvinylsulfonic acid, 20 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (New England Biolabs), 40 U ml−1 RNasin (Promega), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich), 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 μg ml−1 yeast RNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA probes dissolved in DEPC-treated water were added at a final concentration of 10 nM (Integrated DNA Technologies). Samples were washed briefly and incubated in a buffer containing 2× SSC, 20% formamide, 40 U ml−1 RNasin at 40 °C and then washed four times in wash buffer, PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 4 U ml−1 RNasin (Promega). Samples were washed and endogenous biotin was blocked using Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were incubated with a biotin-labelled DNA probe at a concentration of 10 nM at 37 °C in PBS, 1× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg ml−1 yeast RNA. After washing, samples were incubated with 1:100 diluted streptavidin–HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS, 60 min at room temperature followed by washing. Samples were labelled using ImmPACT-DAB substrate, counterstained using haematoxylin QS and imbedded in VectaMount AQ mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Human participants

All research involving human participants was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Samples from patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia and other pneumonia, and non-pneumonia controls were collected from participants enrolled in the Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) study STU00204868. Alveolar macrophages from healthy volunteers were obtained under study STU00206783. Autopsy tissues were obtained by the usual protocols and analysed under study STU00079445. All study participants or their surrogates provided informed consent.

Individuals of at least 18 years of age with suspicion of pneumonia based on clinical criteria (including but not limited to fever, radiographic infiltrate and respiratory secretions) were screened for enrolment into the SCRIPT study. Inability to safely perform BAL or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (NBBAL) were considered exclusion criteria44. In our centre, patients with respiratory failure are intubated on the basis of the judgement of bedside clinicians for worsening hypoxaemia, hypercapnia or work of breathing refractory to high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation modes. Extubation occurs on the basis of the judgement of bedside clinicians following a protocol-driven trial of spontaneous breathing in patients demonstrating physiological improvement in their cardiorespiratory status during their period of mechanical ventilation.

We collected data and samples from patients enrolled in SCRIPT from 15 June 2018 to 6 July 2020 in the ICU at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. We prospectively enrolled 88 of the 179 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b; Extended Data Table 1), all but one of whom had been discharged at the time of our submission. Management of patients with COVID-19 was guided by protocols published and updated on the Northwestern Medicine intranet as new information became available over the pandemic. Clinical laboratory testing including studies ordered on BAL fluid was at the discretion of the care team; however, quantitative cultures, multiplex PCR (BioFire Film Array Respiratory 2 panel), and automated cell count and differential were recommended by local ICU protocols. Most patients also underwent urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 on admission. Clinicians were encouraged to manage all patients, including those with COVID-19, according to ARDSNetwork protocols including the use of a higher PEEP/lower FiO 2 strategy for those with severe hypoxaemia45,46. Prone positioning (16 h per day) was performed in all patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 <150 who did not have contraindications47. In those who had a response to prone positioning evidenced by improved oxygenation, prone positioning was repeated. Oesophageal balloon catheters (Cooper Surgical) were placed at the discretion of the care team to estimate transpulmonary pressure and optimize PEEP, particularly in patients with a higher-than-normal BMI.

Autopsy specimen used for smFISH (RNAscope) (Fig. 4i): an 81-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and cirrhosis was admitted for a fever of 38.5 °C. She had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The patient developed increased O 2 requirements and was subsequently transferred to the COVID ICU. In the ICU, the decedent developed hypotension to about 60/40 mm Hg and after discussion with the clinical team, the decedent’s family elected to focus on comfort care. The patient died 8 days after admission.

NBBAL and BAL procedures

Consent was obtained from patients or their surrogates for bronchoscopic procedures. Bronchoscopic BAL was performed in intubated ICU patients with flexible, single-use Ambu aScope (Ambu) devices. Patients were given sedation and topical anaesthetic at the physician proceduralist’s discretion. Vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The bronchoscope was wedged in the segment of interest based on available chest imaging or intra-procedure observations, aliquots of 30 ml of normal saline at a time, generally 90–120 ml total, were instilled and aspirated back. The fluid returned following the first aliquot was routinely discarded. Samples were split (if sufficient return volume was available) and sent for clinical studies and an aliquot was reserved for research. A similar procedure was applied to NBBAL; however, NBBAL was performed with directional (lateral) but not visual guidance, and as usual procedural care by a respiratory therapist rather than a pulmonologist44.

For bronchoscopies performed in patients with COVID-19, additional precautions were taken to minimize the risk to healthcare workers including only having essential providers present in the room, clamping of the endotracheal tube, transient disconnection of the inspiratory limb from the ventilator, and preloading of the bronchoscope through the adaptor48. Sedation and neuromuscular blockade to prevent cough were administered for these procedures at the physician’s discretion. In most cases of early bronchoscopy, the procedure was performed immediately after intubation, taking advantage of neuromuscular blockade administered for the intubation procedure.

For all patients with COVID-19, samples were collected from regions of greatest chest radiograph abnormality by a critical care physician using a disposable bronchoscope. The majority of samples before the pandemic were collected by respiratory therapists using a NBBAL catheter that is the same diameter as a standard bronchoscope with the catheter directed to the most radiographically affected lung. For both bronchoscopic and NBBAL, the recommended instillate volume was 120 ml and the initial aliquot was discarded if adequate return was obtained44.

Pneumonia adjudication

Five critical care physicians (J.M.K., C.O.P., B.D.S., J.M.W. and R.G.W.) retrospectively adjudicated patients as COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, pneumonia secondary to other pathogens, or non-pneumonia controls (intubated for reasons other than pneumonia), according to a standardized adjudication procedure (the adjudication protocol can be found in Supplementary Data 8). Non-pneumonia controls were defined as patients who underwent BAL to exclude pneumonia but had negative quantitative cultures, a negative multiplex PCR for viral and bacterial pathogens (when available) and negative urine antigens for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophilia serogroup 1, as well as an alternative diagnosis. The treating clinician’s impression was considered, but concordance was not required. Subsequent course and the entirety of the clinical record was used for adjudication. Some of the patients adjudicated as non-pneumonia controls developed ventilator-associated pneumonia later in their clinical course. Viral pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of detection of a respiratory viral pathogen from either a nasopharyngeal swab or BAL fluid in the appropriate clinical setting. Bacterial pneumonia was defined as positive quantitative cultures with more than 100 colony-forming units per ml, detection of a bacterial pathogen by PCR analysis of BAL fluid or a positive urine antigen. Over the course of the study, BAL fluid was analysed using a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) PCR (MRSA/SA SSTI) and the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory 2 (RP2) panel and Pneumonia panels. SARS-CoV-2 was detected with a variety of assay platforms including the Cepheid Gene Expert, Abbott ID NOW, Becton Dickinson, and a locally developed and validated PCR. For some patients without COVID-19, the diagnosis of pneumonia was made on the basis of clinical suspicion, radiographic findings and response to antimicrobial therapy in the absence of an identified pathogen. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed as detection of a new respiratory pathogen using quantitative culture or PCR more than 48 h after intubation, the detection of a new respiratory pathogen on serial BAL samples, or the reappearance of a respiratory pathogen after a negative BAL on a subsequent study. Clinical laboratory data were obtained from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse using Structured Query Language (SQL). APS and SOFA scores were generated from the Electronic Health Record using previously validated programming.

Flow cytometry and cell sorting

NBBAL and BAL samples were filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, pelleted by centrifugation at 300g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by hypotonic lysis of red blood cells with 2 ml BD PharmLyse reagent for 2 min. Lysis was stopped by adding 13 ml MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were pelleted again and resuspended in 100 μl of 1:10 Fc-Block (Human TruStain FcX, Biolegend) in MACS buffer, and a 10-μl aliquot was taken for counting using K2 Cellometer (Nexcelom) with AO/PI reagent. The volume of Fc-Block was adjusted so the concentration of cells was always less than 5 × 107 cells per ml and the fluorophore-conjugated antibody cocktail was added in 1:1 ratio (Extended Data Table 3). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cells were washed with 5 ml MACS buffer, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 500 μl MACS buffer with 2 μl SYTOX Green viability dye (ThermoFisher). Cells were sorted on a FACS Aria III SORP instrument using a 100-μm nozzle at 20 psi. Cells were sorted into 300 μl of MACS buffer for bulk RNA-seq or 300 μl of 2% BSA in PBS for single-cell RNA-seq. Sample processing was performed in BSL-2 facility using BSL-3 practices. Analysis of the flow cytometry data was performed using FlowJo 10.6.2. using a uniform sequential gating strategy (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b) reviewed by three investigators (S.S., B.D.S. and A.V.M.). Immune populations were defined using canonical markers44,49 as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a, b. Alveolar macrophages were defined by the expression of CD206 (mannose receptor). We further subdivided alveolar macrophages into CD206lo alveolar macrophages, which represent differentiating monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, and CD206hi alveolar macrophages, which include both tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, present in the lung before the onset of pneumonia, and mature monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages. Because CD206hi alveolar macrophages can be found in BAL fluid from both healthy volunteers and patients across different types of pneumonia, and the presence of CD206lo alveolar macrophages varies across the patients with pneumonia49,50,51, we focused our transcriptomic analysis on CD206hi alveolar macrophages. Abundance of specific populations in individual BAL fluid samples can be found in Supplementary Data 9.

Bulk RNA-seq of flow cytometry-sorted alveolar macrophages

Immediately after sorting, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 350 μl RLT Plus lysis buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were stored at −80 °C until RNA isolation using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). RNA quality and quantity were assessed using TapeStation 4200 High Sensitivity RNA tapes (Agilent), and RNA-seq libraries were prepared from 250 pg of total RNA using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2 (Takara Bio). Libraries were pooled using dual indexing and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina), 75 cycles, single-end, to an average sequencing depth of 19.55 million reads.

FASTQ files were generated using bcl2fastq (Illumina). To enable detection of viral RNA, a custom hybrid genome was prepared by joining FASTA, GFF and GTF files for GRCh37.87, SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2), and Influenza A/California/07/2009 (GCF_001343785.1), which was the dominant strain of influenza throughout BAL fluid collection at our hospital52. An additional negative strand transcript spanning the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was then added to the GTF and GFF files to enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Normalized counts tables later revealed high enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and enrichment of influenza A virus genes in patients marked as other viral pneumonia. Of note, as our alveolar macrophage sorting strategy for bulk RNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b) focused only on CD206hi cells, our bulk RNA-seq data probably underestimate infection of alveolar macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2d).

To facilitate reproducible analysis, samples were processed using the publicly available nf-core/RNA-seq pipeline version 1.4.2 implemented in Nextflow 19.10.0 using Singularity 3.2.1-1 with the minimal command nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 1.4.2 –singleEnd -profile singularity –reverseStranded –three_prime_clip_r2 353,54,55. In brief, lane-level reads were trimmed using trimGalore! 0.6.4 and aligned to the hybrid genome described above using STAR 2.6.1d56. Gene-level assignment was then performed using featureCounts 1.6.457. Putative sample swaps were identified first by comparing known patient sex with sex determined by levels of XIST and RPS4Y1 expression, followed by single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis with NGSCheckMate v.1.0.0 in FASTQ mode using default settings58. Samples exhibiting unexpected correlation were excluded from analysis.

Bulk differential expression analysis

All analysis was performed using custom scripts in R version 3.6.3 using the DESeq2 v.1.26.0 framework59. Correspondence between lanes was first confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) before merging counts using the command collapseReplicates(). One outlier sample from the ‘other pneumonia’ group with low RIN score and exhibiting extreme deviation on PCA and poor alignment and assignment metrics was excluded from downstream analysis. For differential expression analysis (DEA), both proportion of alveolar macrophage from flow cytometry data and diagnosis were used as explanatory factors. A ‘local’ model of gene dispersion was used, as this better fit dispersion trends without obvious overfitting, and gene outlier replacement was disabled; otherwise default settings were used (see code for details).

k-means clustering of bulk samples

A custom-built function was used (available at https://github.com/NUPulmonary/utils/blob/master/R/k_means_Figure.R) for k-means clustering. In brief, variable genes were identified using a likelihood-ratio test with local estimates of gene dispersion in DESeq2 with diagnosis as the full model as well as a reduced model corresponding to intercept alone. Genes with q ≥0.05 were discarded. Extant genes were then clustered using the Hartigan–Wong method with 25 random sets and a maximum of 1,000 iterations using the kmeans function in R stats 3.6.3. Samples were then clustered using Ward’s method and plotted using pheatmap version 1.0.12. GO term enrichment was then determined using Fisher’s exact test in topGO version 2.38.1, with org.Hs.eg.db version 3.10.0 and GO.db version 3.10.0 as references.

Weighted gene coexpression network analysis

WGCNA was performed manually using WGCNA v.1.69 with default settings unless otherwise noted60. Genes with counts >5 and detection in at least 10% of samples were included in the analysis. To best capture patterns of co-regulation, a signed network was used. Using the pickSoftThreshold function, we empirically determined a soft threshold of 7 to best fit the network structure. A minimum module size of 30 was chosen to isolate relatively large gene modules. Module eigengenes were then related back to patient and sample metadata using biweight midcorrelation. Module GO enrichment was then determined as above using Fisher’s exact test in topGO v.2.38.1, with org.Hs.eg.db v.3.10.0 as a reference. UMAP plotting was performed using uwot version 0.1.8 using the first 20 principal components of the same genes used in WGCNA analysis after z-scaling and centering, with a minimum distance of 0.2 (ref. 61). Default parameters were otherwise used.

Single-cell RNA-seq of flow cytometry-sorted BAL cells

For patients with COVID-19 we limited our analysis to samples in which flow cytometry identified distinct populations of CD206hi and CD206lo macrophages (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, A and B). We included two additional patients, one with bacterial pneumonia secondary to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii (assigned as ‘other pneumonia’, patient 6) and one intubated for airway protection to facilitate endoscopy for severe gastrointestinal bleeding without pneumonia (assigned as a ‘non-pneumonia control’, patient C) to examine nonspecific effects of inflammation and mechanical ventilation, respectively, on transcriptomic signatures.

Samples were enriched by flow cytometry sorting for live cells, excluding granulocytes. Cells were sorted into 2% BSA in Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS), pelleted by centrifugation at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.1% BSA in DPBS to about 1,000 cells μl−1. Concentration was confirmed using K2 Cellometer (Nexcelom) with AO/PI reagent and cells were loaded on 10x Genomics Chip A with Chromium Single Cell 5′ gel beads and reagents (10x Genomics) aiming to capture around 5,000–10,000 cells per library. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics, CG000086_RevM). After quality checks, single-cell RNA-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

Data were processed using the Cell Ranger 3.1.0 pipeline (10x Genomics). To enable detection of viral RNA, reads were aligned to a custom hybrid genome containing GRCh38.93 and SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2). An additional negative-strand transcript spanning the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was then added to the GTF and GFF files to enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Data were processed using Scanpy v.1.5.162, doublets were detected with scrublet v.0.2.163 and removed, ambient RNA was corrected with FastCAR (https://github.com/LungCellAtlas/FastCAR), and multisample integration was performed with BBKNN v.1.3.1264. Only human transcripts were used during integration, selection of highly variable genes and clustering, SARS-CoV-2 transcripts did not influence clustering. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed with signatures retrieved from the gsea-msigdb.org website65 using following terms: HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE M5913, HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE M5911. Computations were automated with snakemake v.5.5.466.

With the exclusion of patients A and B, single-cell RNA-seq was performed without multiplexing, using cells from a single patient per single 10x Genomics chip channel. Cells from patients A and B were split into three 10x Genomics chip channels: sample 14 contained cells from patient A, sample 15 contained cells from patient B and sample 16 contained cells from patients A and B multiplexed together. To assign cells from this sample to patients, we used souporcell v.2.067 (commit 34eade2ad3a361f045a31f53fee58c2e0c49423f) with the list of common variants for GRCh38 genome, provided on the souporcell page. We ran souporcell for samples 14, 15 and 16 with the number of clusters k = 2. We computed Pearson correlation between integer-coded single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genotypic clusters in sample pairs 14–16 and 15–16 to determine which genotypic clusters came from the same patients. Genotypic doublets and unassigned cells were discarded (see code for details).

Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq alveolar macrophage signatures

Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq alveolar macrophage signatures was performed using AutoGeneS v.1.0.368 and signatures derived from the integrated single-cell RNA-seq object. We used an integrated single-cell RNA-seq object containing the first 6 subjects included into analysis (patients 1–6) to train the AutoGeneS model. Signatures were automatically identified from 4,500 highly variable genes with function optimize(ngen = 200, seed = 0, nfeatures = 2000, mode = ”fixed”) (the code is available at https://github.com/NUPulmonary/2020_Grant). The model was then applied to bulk RNA-seq data to estimate the proportion of specific cell types using regression. We used bulk RNA-seq samples from healthy volunteers (which contain only tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and do not contain inflammatory monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages) to validate and optimize selection of the cluster-specific genes and deconvolution results.

RNAscope of paraffin lung slices

RNAscope Multiplex V2 manual assay from ACDbio was performed on paraffin-embedded 5-μm slices of lung tissue using mild digest times according to manufacturer instructions as we have described. Probes used were RNAscope Probe-V-nCoV2019-S-C3 (catalogue (cat.) no. 848561) with Akoya Bio Opal Dye 520 using the 488-nm laser line and RNAscope Probe-nCoV2019-orf1ab-sense-C2 (cat. no. 859151) with Opal Dye 690 using the 640-nm laser line. After the RNAscope assay was complete, slides were washed twice in TBST (1× TBS pH 7.6 with 0.1% Tween-20) for 2 min with agitation. Slides were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min with 10% normal goat serum in 1× TBS with 1% BSA. The blocking solution was removed from slides via gentle flicking. Slides were then incubated in primary antibody solution containing anti-CD206 antibody (clone C-10) conjugated to AF546 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-376232, RRID:AB_10989352) at 1:100 dilution in TBS with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were rinsed twice with TBST for 5 min with agitation, rinsed twice in TBST buffer for 5 min and then mounted and dried overnight. Images were acquired at the Center for Advanced Microscopy at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine using the Nikon W1-Spinning Disk Confocal microscope. Nucleus was added to the images using machine-based learning network trained on one patient using DAPI and brightfield images in Nikon Elements. Final images were rendered using Fiji.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using base R v.3.6.3 with tidyverse version 1.3.069 and Python 3.6. For all comparisons, normality was first assessed using a Shapiro–Wilk test and manual examination of distributions. For parameters that exhibited a clear lack of normality, nonparametric tests were used. In cases of multiple testing, P values were corrected using FDR correction. In Python, we used the mannwhitneyu function from scipy package v.1.3.170 for nonparametric tests, and corrected for multiple testing with the statsmodels package v.0.10.171. Adjusted P values <0.05 were considered significant. Two-sided statistical tests were performed in all cases.

Visualization

Plotting was performed in Figs. 1–3 and Extended Data Figs. 1–3 using ggplot2 v.3.3.1 unless otherwise noted. Comparisons for these figures were added using ggsignif v.0.6.0. Heat maps in Figs. 2, 3 were generated using pheatmap v.1.0.12. Sankey or Alluvial plots in Extended Data Fig. 1 were generated using ggalluvial v.0.12.072. Figure layouts for Figs. 1–4 and Extended Figs. 1, 3 were generated using patchwork v.1.01 and edited in Adobe Illustrator 2021. Figure 4 and Extended Data Figs. 4, 5 were generated with matplotlib v.3.2.173. In all box plots, box limits represent the interquartile range (IQR) with a centre line at the median. Whiskers represent the largest point within 1.5× IQR. All points are overlaid.

Study limitations

First, this is an observational study, and in the absence of a specific intervention targeting a necessary component of our model, our data are hypothesis-generating. Moreover, our observational cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to treatments received and other processes of care. Second, although we made every attempt to standardize BAL fluid volumes, the number of alveoli sampled and the return volume during both bronchoscopic and non-bronchoscopic BAL are variable. Our observations are therefore relative rather than quantitative. Third, our flow cytometry panels, although rigorous, were limited by the number of antibodies that could be used for high-volume characterization of clinical samples. Fourth, our BAL samples were collected as part of clinical care; therefore, sicker patients were more likely to be sampled. Finally, although we made every effort to standardize care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in our ICU, some of our patients were enrolled in clinical trials of remdesivir or sarilumab, many patients received unproven off-label therapies—including hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab—and our study largely preceded reports on the use of steroids in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (Extended Data Table 1). Despite these limitations, our systems approach to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology provides a model with testable predictions that can serve as a template for the design of targeted interventions in patients with severe disease.

If it becomes endemic -- circulating in the general population -- and most people are exposed in childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may join the ranks of mild cold-causing coronaviruses that currently circulate in humans, according to a model developed by Emory and Penn State scientists.

The model, published January 12 in Science, draws upon studies of the four common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-1. For those viruses, the term ""herd immunity"" is incomplete and possibly misleading, says postdoctoral fellow Jennie Lavine, PhD, first author of the Science paper.

The four common cold-causing coronaviruses have been circulating in humans for a long time and almost everyone is infected at a young age -- younger than measles before a vaccine was available. Natural infection in childhood provides immunity that protects people later in life against severe disease, but it doesn't prevent periodic reinfection, says Lavine.

""Reinfection is possible within one year, but even if it occurs, symptoms are mild and the virus is cleared from the body more quickly,"" she says. ""It highlights the need to tease apart the components of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. How long does immunity that prevents pathology last, and how long does immunity that prevents transmission last? Those durations may be very different.""

Studies are now emerging that provide concrete data on how long antibodies and immune cells against SARS-CoV-2 last after infection, Lavine says. However, researchers are still figuring out how those components translate to protection against disease or transmission.

""Overall, we're asking: how does SARS-CoV-2 compare to other viruses such as seasonal influenza or respiratory syncytial virus,"" she says. ""This model assumes immunity to SARS-CoV-2 works similar to other human coronaviruses. We don't really know what it would be like if someone got one of the other coronaviruses for the first time as an adult, rather than as a child.""

The model predicts that the infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2 may fall below that of seasonal influenza (0.1 percent), once an endemic steady-state is reached.

""We are in uncharted territory, but a key take-home message from the study is that immunological indicators suggest that fatality rates and the critical need for broad-scale vaccination may wane in the near term, so maximum effort should be on weathering this virgin pandemic enroute to endemicity,"" said Ottar Bjornstad, Distinguished Professor of Entomology and Biology and J. Lloyd & Dorothy Foehr Huck Chair of Epidemiology, Penn State.

Lavine developed the model, together with Bjornstad and Rustom Antia, PhD, Samuel C. Dobbs professor of biology at Emory University and Emory Vaccine Center.

A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 could save hundreds of thousands of lives in the first year or two of vaccine roll-out, but continued mass vaccination may be less critical once SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, the authors say. Targeted vaccination in vulnerable subpopulations may still save lives, they say.

Another implication is: during the transition to endemicity, that using symptoms only as a surveillance tool to look for infections and curb the virus' spread will become more difficult. Thus, widely available testing may become particularly important during vaccine roll-out to protect vulnerable populations, the authors point out.

So far, the available data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants and young children suggest that severity is generally mild and mortality is low. There are exceptions on the individual level, with some experiencing rare complications such as MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). In contrast, if SARS-CoV-2 infection in childhood were to become more severe -- like MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) -- routine vaccination programs will be still necessary, the authors say.

Initial cases were linked to a ‘wet market’ selling seafood and wild animals. Now, over a year on with more than 99 million confirmed cases and nearly 2 million deaths worldwide, Covid-19 is the worst global public-health crisis since the 1918 flu pandemic. As it continues to disrupt our lives, many questions still remain unanswered about Sars-CoV-2 – the virus behind the disease. We still don’t know exactly why it drastically affects some people more than others or how long immunity might keep it at bay.

As soon as we heard about this virus, we got ready to work with it Andrew Davidson, University of Bristol

But given the virus was discovered only a year ago, scientists already know an astonishing amount about it. Within days of its detection, researchers, clinicians and academics began churning out studies that would help governments to slow the wave of community infection and allow tests, drugs and vaccines to be developed at unprecedented speed. To date more than 287,000 Covid-related papers have been published.

‘There have been some very difficult days so far in the pandemic but seeing the research community come together to work towards a common goal has been really exciting,’ says Jason Kindrachuk, who studies emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba, Canada. ‘Being able to look at the genome sequencing in early January [2020] gave us some very quick glimpses into what this virus was, how it might be spread and what receptor it might use to gain access into our cells.’

Pinning down the pathogen

Efforts to sequence the virus kicked-off at the end of December 2019, when the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first stepped-in. Hospitals in Wuhan were receiving growing numbers of sick people with serious pneumonia-like symptoms, including fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing. Doctors noticed similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) an infection caused by a coronavirus, which broke out in China between 2002 and 2004. Sars killed 11% of the 8422 people known to contract it. That virus was brought under control but no vaccine or antiviral exists. Chinese authorities were understandably alarmed.

CDC scientists worked around the clock to identify the mystery pathogen, first extracting RNA from fluid samples taken from the lower respiratory tract of several patients.1 The researchers ran the pathogen’s RNA through a polymerase chain reaction-based test, that can identify 22 known respiratory pathogens. The test drew a blank. It had to be something new.

To find out what, the extracted RNA was used as a template to clone complete genomes of the culprit. These were then sequenced and compared with known pathogens. The results revealed it was a novel coronavirus with an 85% sequence match to the virus that causes Sars. It was also 96% similar to a non-human coronavirus found in bats, offering clues as to where it first evolved. Within days of the CDC initiating its emergency response, the first draft genome sequence was posted online. Other sequences swiftly followed. Researchers around the world could now begin unpicking what makes this new pathogen tick.

Coronavirus clues

Knowing it was a coronavirus, and one that closely resembled the Sars coronavirus, gave scientists a head start. ‘As soon as we heard about this virus, we got ready to work with it,’ says Andrew Davidson at the University of Bristol. He has studied coronaviruses for the past 20 years and at the beginning of the pandemic worked in one of the few UK labs equipped to contain such hazardous pathogens. ‘Because it is so similar to the Sars coronavirus we could tap into all that prior knowledge.

Our top priority was to create a stabilised spike protein for use as a vaccine antigen Jason McClellan, University of Texas

Coronaviruses have been studied for decades. Most of them persist within animal populations, particularly birds and bats, but six were already known to infect humans. Four of these invade our upper airways producing mild common cold-like illnesses. But the two more recent and lethal varieties to emerge prefer to replicate in our lungs where they can very damaging. Sars is one of them. The other is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) first seen in 2012, and the most lethal – 35% of the 2468 confirmed cases in 2012 resulted in death.

‘This new virus seems to fit in a niche between mild coronaviruses that cause the common cold and the more lethal Sars and Mers coronaviruses,’ says Davidson. ‘It seems to be spread more easily from the upper respiratory tract but because it can infect the lower airways it can cause severe disease too.’ This double whammy of infectiousness and potential severity is why it has caused such a problem. Although less lethal than Sars and Mers coronaviruses, Sars-CoV-2 has been so infectious that the number of deaths is far higher.

Belonging to a diverse family of viruses, coronaviruses have at their core a small set of genes encoded on a sense single-strand of RNA. Fatty lipid molecules form a ball-shaped shell that encases this RNA, which explains why hand washing with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers was quickly recommended because these break down lipids, destroying virus particles. Sars-CoV-2’s outer surface is studded with club-like protrusions called spike glycoproteins. It’s these carbohydrate-containing proteins that give it a corona under the microscope. These spikes are the key to how these viruses gain entry to host cells. ‘Our top priority was to create a stabilised spike protein for use as a vaccine antigen,’ says Jason McClellan at the University of Texas. He has studied coronavirus spikes since 2013. ‘The spike structure is important for understanding the antibody response to natural infection and vaccination.’

With the virus’s genome sequenced, scientists could predict which proteins it encodes and begin to understand the spikes. Genetic analyses and computer modelling early on hinted that the cell entry mechanism of Sars-CoV-2’s spike proteins was much like the Sars virus’s. In Sars, the virus’s spikes were known to stick to a claw-like receptor protein called Ace2. This is involved in regulating the cardiovascular system and is found in high levels on the surface of our lung cells. But it’s also on cells in our upper airways, the heart, kidneys and digestive tract. Once the virus latches on, the spike proteins split apart allowing the virus’s lipid layer to fuse with its host’s cell membrane. The virus then releases its RNA into the cell, effectively hijacking the cell’s machinery to produce more virus particles. These new virions disperse from the dead cell – a process called viral shedding – to infect more cells or be transmitted to other people via respiratory droplets.

Efficient entry

Several structural studies soon confirmed independently that Ace2 is indeed how Sars-CoV-2 enters our cells. However, when McLellan’s lab stabilised protein spikes and mapped their 3D structure using cryo-electron microscopy – barely within a month of the genome being sequenced – it was discovered that Sars-CoV-2’s spikes bind 10 to 20 times more tightly to Ace2 than the original Sars virus.2

Not long after, Jian Shang and colleagues at the University of Minnesota identified why Sars-CoV-2 bound more tightly. First, a binding domain on the spike has a more compact shape that fits more snugly to Ace2. Second, the spike has certain amino acid residue changes that stabilise two viral binding hotspots.3 This offers clues as to why Sars-CoV-2 transmits so well. The easier it is for the virus to latch on to a cell, the better it can infect and spread.

‘It is astounding to think how exquisitely important this relationship between a viral protein and a host receptor is to community transmission and pre-symptomatic infection,’ says Kindrachuk. ‘I think back to those early days of the pandemic when we were talking of outbreaks on cruise ships, and the role of close quarters in spread, and to then overlay how quickly we were able to determine the central role of the spike protein aligning with Ace2 as a key event in transmission.’

These assessments of the spike protein have informed the rational design of vaccines that have literally moved from bench to bedside in less than a year Jason Kindrachuk, University of Manitoba

Meanwhile, other studies, including one that Davidson collaborated on, have independently found that Sars-CoV-2 binds to another protein receptor on our cells called neuropilin-1 (NRP1).4 ‘It’s not the main receptor but it could certainly help the virus get into cells more effectively,’ Davidson explains. The study he worked on showed that while deleting NRP1 from the cell doesn’t prevent the virus entering, it’s presence gives the virus an extra foothold to latch on to cells. ‘Other studies have shown that neuropilin-1 seems to be at enhanced levels in respiratory tract and olfactory systems [where the virus initially enters our body],’ he says. According to another study, this receptor could also help the virus invade the nervous system, which could help explain taste and smell loss that’s been reported in many Covid-19 cases. These symptoms are also thought to be associated with abundance of Ace2 and a protease – an enzyme which breaks down proteins – called TMPRSS2 that maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons.

This protease is another requirement for Sars-CoV-2 to infect our cells. Studies by German researchers showed that the virus needs TMPRSS2 and another protease in particular. It was previously known that the Sars virus depends on TMPRSS2 from host cells to activate the spike after it has bound to Ace2. This activation allows the spike to split and alter its shape, exposing a site that enables the virus to fuse with and enter the cell.

However, the German team discovered that the Sars-CoV-2 virus also depends on a furin protease to help split the spike more easily.5 This occurs at a furin cleavage site on the spike, which is missing in the original Sars virus, suggesting another reason why Sars-CoV-2 is so much more infectious. Scientists think that the fact that this enzyme is found throughout the body could be a key factor that enables the virus to infect both lower and upper airways, as well as other parts of the body.

Now, as more transmissible mutant strains are circulating, knowledge of the spike protein and how it might mutate is more valuable than ever to suppress the virus. Davidson suggests the virus is now so widespread that eradication is unlikely. Rather, it will probably become seasonal requiring new vaccines each year like the flu. But the fact that vaccines now exist after just over a year is testament to what scientists can achieve.

‘In thinking back to those early days in January 2020, the most important questions at that point were “What was this virus and how is it being transmitted?”’ says Kindrachuk. ‘These assessments of the spike protein have informed the rational design of vaccines that have literally moved from bench to bedside in less than a year. That is something that is truly historic.’

Within households, children and adolescents were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but were more infectious than older individuals. Presymptomatic cases were more infectious and individuals with asymptomatic infection less infectious than symptomatic cases. These findings have implications for devising interventions for blocking household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as timely vaccination of eligible children once resources become available.

27 101 households with 29 578 primary cases and 57 581 household contacts were identified. The secondary attack rate estimated with the transmission model was 15·6% (95% CI 15·2–16·0), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days. Individuals aged 60 years or older were at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than all other age groups. Infants aged 0–1 years were significantly more likely to be infected than children aged 2–5 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·20, 95% CI 1·40–3·44) and children aged 6–12 years (1·53, 1·01–2·34). Given the same exposure time, children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age were more likely to infect others than were adults aged 60 years or older (1·58, 1·28–1·95). Asymptomatic individuals were much less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases (0·21, 0·14–0·31). Symptomatic cases were more likely to infect others before symptom onset than after (1·42, 1·30–1·55). After mass isolation of cases, quarantine of household contacts, and restriction of movement policies were implemented, household reproductive numbers declined by 52% among primary cases (from 0·25 [95% CI 0·24–0·26] to 0·12 [0·10–0·13]) and by 63% among secondary cases (from 0·17 [0·16–0·18] to 0·063 [0·057–0·070]).

This retrospective cohort study included the households of all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections identified by the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020. We defined households as groups of family members and close relatives who did not necessarily live at the same address and considered households that shared common contacts as epidemiologically linked. We used a statistical transmission model to estimate household secondary attack rates and to quantify risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection, accounting for individual-level exposure history. We assessed how intervention policies affected the household reproductive number, defined as the mean number of household contacts a case can infect.

Wuhan was the first epicentre of COVID-19 in the world, accounting for 80% of cases in China during the first wave. We aimed to assess household transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection in Wuhan.

Here, we present an analysis of a large number of households extracted from contact tracing records in Wuhan, the first epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, where 80% of confirmed cases in China were reported. We estimated the transmission probability of SARS-CoV-2 within households and evaluated drivers for infectivity of cases and susceptibility of their household contacts, while adjusting for measured confounders and individual-level exposure history. We assessed the infectivity levels of both presymptomatic cases and asymptomatic infections. Finally, we estimated the effectiveness of case isolation and quarantine of household contacts away from home in reducing household transmission in Wuhan.

Households are ideal settings for assessing transmissibility of a pathogen and associated determinants of susceptibility and infectivity. The household secondary attack rate is defined as the probability that an infected person will transmit the pathogen to a susceptible household member during their infectious period. A meta-analysis estimated the household secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2 as approximately 15–22%,higher than the estimated rates of 5–10% for SARS-CoV and 1–5% for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.Most studies neither distinguished between secondary and tertiary transmissions nor controlled for exposure history. Some household studies revealed that children were less susceptible to the virus than older adults, and that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was inversely related to household size.Whether infectivity differs by age is less clear,in part because when there are coprimary cases within a household, it is not possible to resolve which resulted in secondary infections. The relative importance of the presymptomatic (incubation) period versus the symptomatic period has been noted or quantified in some studies.However, few studies have assessed the relative infectivity of asymptomatic infections, although some modelling studies have used values extrapolated from viral load data of mild and severe cases.

Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen China: a retrospective cohort study.

The high infectivity of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the need for careful planning of school reopening. Additionally, the susceptibility of infants supports caregivers of infants being prioritised for vaccination. When feasible, cases could be isolated and household contacts quarantined away from their homes to prevent household transmission, particularly when presymptomatic.

Based on contact-tracing records from more than 27 000 households in Wuhan up to April 18, we found that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted with moderate efficiency within households at the very beginning of the pandemic, with an overall secondary attack rate of 15·6% (95% CI 15·2–16·0). Children and adolescents were less susceptible to infection, but more infectious once infected, than individuals aged 20 years or older. Children's higher infectivity was affected by household size. Our study confirmed higher susceptibility of infants (aged 0–1 years) to infection than older children (≥2 years of age). Although children and adolescents were much less likely to have severe disease, they were as likely as adults to develop symptoms. We confirmed the high infectiousness of cases during the incubation period and found asymptomatically infected individuals were about 80% less infectious than symptomatic cases. Finally, we found isolation of cases and quarantining of household contacts away from home effectively reduced household transmission.

Households offer an ideal setting for assessing person-to-person transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk factors for infectivity and susceptibility to infection. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for articles published between Dec 1, 2019, and Aug 20, 2020, using the search terms (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019-nCoV”) AND (“household” OR “family”) AND (“transmissibility” OR “risk factors”). We identified 22 relevant articles. Secondary attack rate estimates varied across countries from 4·6% in Taiwan to 31·6% in Zhejiang Province, China, and were mostly based on studies with fewer than 300 households. Some studies found that older age groups were associated with increased susceptibility to infection or disease, and a study in Israel identified infants as a highly susceptible group. A study in Guangzhou found no effect of age on infectivity, probably due to a small sample size. A study in South Korea reported a high infection rate among household contacts of index cases aged 10–19 years old, but not in household contacts of younger index cases. A few studies confirmed efficient presymptomatic transmission of the virus. Two studies reported much lower infectivity of asymptomatic infections than symptomatic cases, with odds ratios of 0·028 and 0·25.

About a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the global cumulative incidence of cases is still climbing, reaching more than 83·6 million as of Jan 1, 2021.The resumption of economic activities depends on our understanding of important transmission venues such as households, workplaces, and schools for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), drivers of transmission, and availability of effective control measures. Households are major transmission venues for many respiratory pathogens. The WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggested that most epidemiologically linked clusters in China were households and urged prioritisation of studies on risk factors for household transmission.In resource-limited areas, including Wuhan in China early on in the epidemic, isolation of cases and quarantine of close contacts often occurred at home, enabling onwards transmission within households. Although children are less likely to develop severe disease than adults,their ability to transmit to household contacts is not well characterised, yet it is highly relevant for preventing transmission in schools and households.

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

From Feb 23, 2020, all household contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of symptom status. Before then, a substantial number of household contacts without symptoms were not tested, creating uncertainty in their infection status. We used a two-step imputation approach with the first step imputing infection status and the second step imputing a time interval that is informative about the potential infection time of each imputed asymptomatic infection ( appendix 2 pp 17–18 ). The imputation involves regression models based on characteristics of the household contacts, the primary cases, and the household itself that are related to whether asymptomatic household contacts were tested or not and were potentially related to the infection outcome ( appendix 2 pp 24–25 ). For both the GEE analysis and the chain-binomial transmission analysis, the results were averaged over 300 sets of imputed data. Households with members with missing ages were excluded from all age-related analyses.

To account for individual-level exposure history and potential tertiary transmission, we also used a chain-binomial transmission model to estimate the secondary attack rate. This model was also used to evaluate determinants of infectivity and susceptibility to infection ( appendix 2 pp 11–17 ). Here, both infectivity and susceptibility refer to a combination of biological effects (eg, immune response or viral shedding) and physical exposure, and our analysis cannot distinguish one mechanism from another. We assumed that each susceptible individual was exposed to any infected household members as well as a non-specific external force of infection, and that two household members had contact with each other when neither was isolated or quarantined at centralised facilities. Households with only primary cases but no exposed household contacts were excluded from the transmission analyses. A Monte Carlo expectation maximisation algorithm was used to account for uncertainties in the infection date of asymptomatic infections ( appendix 2 pp 13–14 ).We performed analyses under several plausible assumptions about the distributions of the incubation and infectious periods based on the literature ( appendix 2 pp 9–11, 23 ).We report results assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days for the primary analysis. We compared household reproductive numbers, defined as the mean number of household contacts an infectious person can infect, across three time windows—before Jan 24, 2020 (before lockdown), Jan 24–Feb 10 (moderate control), and after Feb 10 (strong control)—to assess the effectiveness of general interventions such as case isolation, quarantine of close contacts, and restriction of human movement in communities ( panel ).

Body temperature of each resident was monitored twice a day. Discharged patients who had been admitted with COVID-19 were told to isolate for an additional 14 days at home. A 3-day campaign was initiated on Feb 20 to test (real-time PCR) all confirmed cases, suspected cases, feverish individuals, and close contacts of cases.

The government required district-level centralised isolation and treatment of all confirmed cases, suspected cases, and feverish patients with pneumonia symptoms; quarantine of close contacts of cases at designated facilities; and reporting of asymptomatic infections.

Patients with fever were required to self-report to community health-care centres. Individuals with mild symptoms but not identified as suspected cases were told to isolate either at home or in designated facilities. Severe or suspected COVID-19 cases were admitted to hospital.

Lockdown of Wuhan was declared. All public transportation within the city and inbound and outbound transportation were suspended.

Characteristics of primary cases, secondary cases, and uninfected or untested household contacts were compared using the χ 2 test for discrete variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. The observed secondary attack rate was calculated as the proportion of secondary infections among all household contacts, assuming untested contacts were uninfected. Total numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, proportions of confirmed cases among the population (ie, community-level attack rates), total numbers of contact-traced households, and average observed household secondary attack rates were mapped at the community level in Wuhan using ArcGIS (version 10.2; Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). Population data were obtained from the Hubei Health Statistics and Information Platform. A generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression model with a logistic link function and an exchangeable correlation structure for each household was used to assess individual-level and household-level risk factors for infection of household contacts. Both the observed secondary attack rate and GEE model were restricted to households with a single primary case. Both assumed that all secondary cases were infected by the primary case, and that all household contacts were equally exposed to the primary case. All descriptive analyses and the GEE modelling were done using R (version 3.6.1).

Households that shared common contacts were considered epidemiologically linked and were merged into a single household for all analyses, although we retained the original household size for analyses of household size as a risk factor ( appendix 2 pp 7–8 ). We evaluated the overall household secondary attack rate in the primary analysis but also distinguished individuals who lived at the same address from those who did not in a sensitivity analysis.

COVID-19 cases were defined according to the National Health Commission of China's Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19, with seven editions released over the study period ( appendix 2 pp 3–4 ). Clinically confirmed cases were defined as suspected cases of COVID-19 with typical pneumonia manifestations who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed cases were individuals with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR using respiratory specimens, and included asymptomatic infection ( appendix 2 p 3 ). For this study, a household contact of an identified case was broadly defined as a family member or close relative who had unprotected contact with the case within 2 days before the symptom onset or test-positive specimen collection of the case but did not necessarily live at the same address. For each household, the date with the earliest symptom onset (symptomatic infection) or the first test-positive specimen (asymptomatic infection) was designated as day 1. Primary cases were defined as cases (including asymptomatic infections) who had symptom onset or the first test-positive specimens collected on day 1 or day 2, enabling households to have coprimary cases. Later cases were classified as secondary cases.

Written informed consent was waived by the National Health Commission of China for outbreak investigations of notifiable infectious diseases. All identifiable personal information was removed from the data by Wuhan CDC before any analysis. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Wuhan CDC (WHCDCIRB-K-2020012).

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted epidemiological investigations to trace the close contacts of ascertained cases, following the Prevention and Control Plan for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China.The retrospective cohort analysed here includes all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infections identified between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020, in Wuhan, China, together with their household contacts. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and time and location of quarantine or isolation were recorded for all investigated individuals.

The model-estimated secondary attack rate was moderately sensitive to assumptions around incubation and infectious periods, varying from 10·4% (95% CI 10·1–10·7) to 17·1% (16·7–17·5), with larger estimates associated with a longer incubation period or a longer infectious period ( table 3 ). An extension of the infectious period to 27 days (21 days after symptom onset) led to a further increase in the secondary attack rate estimate to 17·8% (17·4–18·2; appendix 2 p 34 ). This sensitivity results from the fact that how the transmission model allocates secondary infections between the external force of infection and infectious household members depends on the durations of the incubation and infectious periods. Most findings about risk factors are robust to varying assumptions about the natural history of disease ( table 3 ). The estimated infectivity of asymptomatic infections versus symptomatic infections varied moderately (ORs 0·16–0·53) on or after Feb 2, whereas that of presymptomatic infections versus symptomatic infections varied more notably (ORs 0·76–2·92), between the extreme values for the incubation and infectious periods ( table 3 ). When primary cases were defined as those with the earliest symptom onset or test-positive specimen collection date in their households (excluding the following day), the estimate of secondary attack rate increased slightly to 17·0% (16·6–17·4; appendix 2 p 35 ). Limiting analysis to the 15 922 households with all contacts tested, which accounted for about 60% of all households, the estimates of risk factors' effects were qualitatively similar, but the estimated secondary attack rates increased—eg, to 20·6% (95% CI 20·0–21·2) under the assumption of a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days—suggesting households with more secondary cases were more likely to have complete testing ( appendix 2 p 36 ). When the effect of age on infectivity was stratified by household size, the higher infectivity of children than adults was mainly limited to households with more than three members ( appendix 2 p 37 ). The transmission model provided satisfactory goodness-of-fit to the data, especially under the longer infectious period ( appendix 2 p 22 ).

When exploring how the effective household reproductive numbers changed over the pandemic periods, we found a decrease from 0·25 (95% CI 0·24–0·26) up to Feb 10 to 0·12 (0·10–0·13) after among primary cases, marking a 52% reduction ( table 4 ). The reduction was more substantial for secondary cases, from around 0·17 (0·16–0·18) to 0·063 (0·057–0·070), a 63% reduction.

Data in parentheses are 95% CIs. Epidemic phases are defined by intervention policy (lockdown from Jan 23 to April 7, 2020, and tightened community management since Feb 11; panel).

Both models found infected individuals who remained asymptomatic during the whole infection course to be much less infectious than symptomatic cases. The GEE model estimated an OR of 0·34 (95% CI 0·21–0·54) for asymptomatic individuals versus patients with mild and moderate disease ( table 2 ). The transmission model estimated an OR of 0·42 (0·17–1·04) for asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals up to Feb 1, which decreased to 0·21 (0·14–0·31) afterwards ( table 3 ). Asymptomatic infections were formally required to be reported in Wuhan from Feb 1, which suggests greater ascertainment bias before Feb 1. For this reason, the estimated relative infectivity after Feb 1 is probably more accurate, implying that an asymptomatically infected individual was associated with about 80% lower infectivity than a symptomatic case after symptom onset. When allowing infectivity to differ before and after symptom onset among symptomatic cases, the transmission model estimated the presymptomatic (incubation) period was more infectious than the symptomatic period ( table 3 ).

According to the transmission model, cases younger than 20 years were more likely to infect others than cases older than 60 years ( table 3 ). Sex and disease severity did not seem to have an appreciable impact on infectivity, although disease severity was statistically associated with onwards transmission in the transmission model ( table 3 ). Clinically diagnosed cases were less infectious than laboratory-confirmed cases ( table 3 ). The GEE and transmission models produced largely concordant results regarding infectivity across age groups, except that the GEE model identified primary cases younger than 20 years old as being less infectious than older ones, whereas the transmission model suggested the opposite ( Table 2 Table 3 ). The GEE model also found individuals older than 80 years to be similar to those aged 60–79 years in terms of both infectivity and susceptibility to infection ( table 2 ), and these two age groups were thus combined for transmission modelling.

In general, both the observed secondary attack rate and model-estimated odds of infection (with regard to susceptibility) increased with age of the household contacts ( Table 2 Table 3 ). Individuals aged 60 years or older were the most susceptible age group to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The least susceptible age group was children aged 2–5 years. The transmission model estimated that individuals younger than 20 years were about 66–84% (ORs ranging from 0·16 to 0·34) less susceptible than adults aged 60 years or older, and adults aged 20–59 years were 31–49% (ORs ranging from 0·51 to 0·69) less susceptible ( table 3 ). Infants (aged 0–1 years) were more susceptible to infection than toddlers (2–5 years; OR 2·20, 95% CI 1·40–3·44) and elementary-school-aged children (6–12 years; 1·53, 1·01–2·34). Female contacts were slightly more susceptible than male contacts ( table 3 ). The GEE model yielded similar ORs, although it estimated slightly larger differences in susceptibility between older contacts (≥60 years) and younger ones ( table 2 ).

Based on the chain-binomial model adjusted for all covariates, household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was inversely associated with household size ( table 3 appendix 2 p 32 ). The GEE model showed a similar household size effect ( table 2 ). Compared with Jan 24–Feb 10, 2020, odds of daily household transmission between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual was lower after Feb 10 ( table 3 ). A greater reduction was seen in the observed household secondary attack rate, from near 20% in the periods before Feb 10 to 4·1% after ( table 2 ).

For the 24 985 households that had only a single primary case, the overall observed secondary attack rate was 16·0% (95% CI 15·7–16·3; table 2 ). The secondary attack rate estimated by the chain-binomial transmission model was similar, 15·6% (15·2–16·0), under the assumption of a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days ( table 3 appendix 2 p 30 ). The model-estimated secondary attack rate for contacts living at the same residential address was 16·1% (15·6–16·5), higher than the 12·6% (11·4–13·9) rate estimated for contacts from the same household but living in different residences—eg, grandparents and grandchildren ( appendix 2 p 31 ).

Data are secondary attack rate (95% CI) or odds ratio (95% CI). Overall secondary attack rates, regardless of characteristics of the infector, infectee, or household, were estimated with a separate model with fewer covariates than the model used to estimate odds ratios ( appendix p 30 ), as some covariates will change the interpretation of the secondary attack rate. Estimates of baseline daily transmission probabilities within households and from an external source, as well as estimates of daily transmission probabilities between different age groups within households, are shown in the appendix (pp 32–33)

Untested contacts were treated as uninfected in the calculations. Secondary attack rates are not based on the transmission model. Odds ratios are calculated from a multivariable generalised estimating equation model. NA=not applicable.

Age was missing for 1027 contacts in 744 single-primary-case households; these households were excluded from the estimation of observed secondary attack rates by age group and from the multivariate generalised estimating equation model.

Secondary cases were less severe clinically than primary cases, with more asymptomatic cases (4·2% vs 1·9%) and fewer severe or critical cases (13·9% vs 19·2%; table 1 ). Clinical severity was missing for 280 cases and was assumed to be mild for these cases in all subsequent analyses. Among the 4903 primary and secondary cases with symptoms recorded, the most common systemic symptoms were fever (in 2970 [60·6%]), fatigue (in 1325 [27·0%]), and myalgia (in 626 [12·8%]), and themost common respiratory symptoms were dry cough (in 1776 [36·2%]), shortness of breath (in 846 [17·3%]), productive cough (in 661 [13·5%]), and chest tightness or pain (in 633 [12·9%]; appendix 2 p 27 ). Radiological evidence of pulmonary abnormality was confirmed in 3247 (66·2%) of 4903 cases. Secondary cases had lower rates of systemic or respiratory symptoms but a higher rate of radiological evidence than primary cases ( appendix 2 p 27 ). Using data after Feb 22, 2020, when most household contacts were laboratory tested, we estimated the proportion of secondary cases who developed symptoms after infection (pathogenicity) to be 84·0% (95% CI 81·7–86·1; 913/1087; appendix 2 p 28 ). Young adults aged 20–39 years were less likely to develop symptoms upon infection than those aged 60 years or older (78·8%, 95% CI 73·0–83·8 [186/236] vs 87·5%, 83·9–90·6 [351/401]). The pathogenicity of infection in children and adolescents (84·7%, 76·0–91·2 [83/98]) resembled that of adults aged 40 years or older, although symptomatic cases among children and adolescents were much less likely to be severe or critical than for those aged 60 years or older (2·4%, 95% CI 0·3–8·4 [two of 83] vs 18·8%, 14·9–23·3 [66/351]). Neither pathogenicity nor disease severity differed between the two sexes ( appendix 2 p 28 ).

The cases included in this study accounted for 76·7% (39 945/52 070) of all reported cases in Wuhan as of April 18 ( appendix 2 p 20 ). The majority of reported cases had symptom onset between Jan 24 and Feb 10 ( table 1 ). More cases were reported and more infected households were contact traced in densely populated districts in central Wuhan such as Wu-Chang, Jiang-Han, Jiang-An, Qiao-Kou, Han-Yang, and Hong-Shan ( figure ). The community-level attack rates showed a similar distribution, with higher rates in central Wuhan, but average observed household secondary attack rates were spatially more evenly distributed ( figure ).

Figure Spatial distribution of all confirmed COVID-19 cases and the retrospective cohort of contact-traced households reported during Dec 2, 2019–April 18, 2020, at the community level in Wuhan, China

From Dec 2, 2019, to April 18, 2020, 29 405 households with at least one clinically confirmed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were identified. After merging epidemiologically linked households, we obtained 27 101 households with 29 578 primary cases, including coprimary cases. These primary cases had 57 581 household contacts, consisting of 10 367 secondary cases, 29 658 test-negative contacts, and 17 556 untested contacts ( table 1 ). The median household size (before merging) was three people (IQR 2–4), and 72·7% (21 385/29 405) of the households had two or three household members. Large households tended to be younger and were more often detected later in the epidemic ( appendix 2 p 26 ). The median age among all cases was 56 years (43–66), and 20 760 (52·0%) cases were female. Age data were missing for 1112 test-negative or untested contacts in 806 households. Primary cases and secondary cases shared similar age and sex profiles ( table 1 ). Compared with uninfected or untested contacts, secondary cases were older, more likely to be female, and more likely to live in smaller households ( table 1 ). Secondary cases were more likely to be laboratory confirmed than primary cases ( table 1 ).

Severity categories were measured at the time of clinical assessment or laboratory testing. Mild cases include 280 cases for whom severity was missing. A total of 2060 cases died.

Including 8619 asymptomatic contacts who might have been tested but whose laboratory test records were missing; these individuals were treated as untested in all analyses. Age data were missing for 1112 test-negative or untested household contacts.

Discussion

We characterised the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 within households and associated risk factors in Wuhan, China, based on a large amount of household contact-tracing data available from early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a statistical transmission model, we found individuals older than 60 years were more likely to be infected than the younger population, especially those younger than 20 years. Additionally, infants were more likely to be infected than older children. Once infected, children and adolescents were as likely as adults to develop symptoms, although much less likely to have severe disease. In addition, children and adolescents were more likely to infect others than were older age groups. Individuals with asymptomatic infection were less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases. Symptomatic cases were more infectious during the incubation period than during the symptomatic period.

The estimated household secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan is similar to that in Guangzhou (15·6% vs 15·5%) found by a previous study using comparable methods.Moreover, our observed household secondary attack rate in Wuhan (16·0%) was similar to that in Guangzhou (13·2%) and Shenzhen (14·9%), but lower than that in Beijing (23%) and Zhejiang province (31·6%).Secondary attack rate estimates in mainland China have tended to be higher than those for other locations—eg, 10·5% in the USA and 4·6% in Taiwan.The heterogeneity in household secondary attack rates across different regions is probably due to differences in control measures, surveillance practices, and crowdedness in households.

et al. Clinical characteristics and viral RNA detection in children with coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Korea. It has been reported that children are less, and elderly adults are more, prone to severe clinical outcomes from COVID-19,and several studies have found that older age groups are more likely to get infected.Similar to this study, a study in Bnei Brak, Israel, observed a higher risk of infection among infants aged 0–1 years than in older children.A possible explanation for this finding is that infants have weaker innate immune systems and closer contact with parents than older children. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 was less likely to cause symptoms upon infection among young adults in their 20s and 30s, but its pathogenicity in children and adolescents was similar to that in adults aged 40 years or older. Similar levels of pathogenicity in children were noticed before in China and South Korea based on a much smaller number of observations, but no comparison was made with other age groups in those studies.

, which implied a short duration of exposure of contacts to infected children, supports the higher infectivity of children than adults suggested by the chain-binomial model. A survey during the early epidemic phase in Wuhan found higher contact frequency between the age groups 0–20 years and 30–50 years than between any other age groups, which could explain in part the higher infectivity of children. 24 Zhang J

et al. Contact tracing during coronavirus disease outbreak, South Korea, 2020. Using the transmission model, we found that cases younger than 20 years were nearly 60% more likely to infect others than cases aged 60 years or older. This finding seems to contradict the observed secondary attack rates of the two groups and the GEE-based odds ratio estimates ( table 2 ). The observed secondary attack rate and the GEE model did not account for individual-level exposure history and should be interpreted as unconditional results—ie, not adjusted for the amount of exposure. By contrast, the chain-binomial model evaluated how risk factors change transmission probability per daily exposure. In addition, GEE-based estimates did not consider tertiary transmissions from secondary cases to household contacts. We found children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly those who were secondary cases, were more likely than adults to infect household members who were actually exposed to them during their infectious periods ( appendix 2 pp 18–19, 29 ). This fact, together with the much faster isolation of child cases ( appendix 2 p 38 which implied a short duration of exposure of contacts to infected children, supports the higher infectivity of children than adults suggested by the chain-binomial model. A survey during the early epidemic phase in Wuhan found higher contact frequency between the age groups 0–20 years and 30–50 years than between any other age groups, which could explain in part the higher infectivity of children.The infectivity of children could be modified by other factors, which merits further investigation. For example, the higher infectivity of children than of adults was mainly limited to households with more than three members in our study. Moreover, a recent study in South Korea reported a high infection rate among household contacts of index cases aged 10–19 years but not among household contacts of younger index cases.

et al. Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing. Using the transmission model on data available after Feb 1, we estimated that individuals with asymptomatic infections were about 80% less likely to infect others than symptomatic cases. While it has long been speculated that individuals with asymptomatic infection can transmit the disease, strong epidemiological evidence has been scarce, and a reliable assessment of the relative infectivity of asymptomatic infections versus symptomatic infections was lacking before this study.A study in Anhui province of China compared secondary attack rates among general contacts between 131 individuals with asymptomatic infections and 16 symptomatic cases, with an OR of 0·25.All 16 symptomatic cases tested positive before symptom onset, implying the possibility of selection bias. A recent meta-analysis estimated household secondary attack rates to be 19·9% for symptomatic index cases and 0·7% for asymptomatic ones, suggesting an OR of 0·028, which is much lower than our estimate of 0·21.Some modelling studies extrapolated the relative infectivity of asymptomatic or subclinical infections from viral load dynamics of mild and severe cases, and their results tended to be lower than our estimates.

et al. Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain COVID-19 in China. Our results show the importance of isolating cases and quarantining household contacts outside of the home to prevent onwards transmission within households. During the period Jan 24–Feb 10, when many people with mild COVID-19 were isolated at home, the observed secondary attack rate and the model-estimated effective reproductive number within households remained essentially unchanged compared with before Jan 24 ( Table 2 Table 4 ). When massive case isolation and quarantine of household contacts at designated places reached full coverage near mid-February, both the observed household secondary attack rate and household effective reproductive numbers were substantially reduced, consistent with a previous modelling study.Such dramatic reduction in household transmissibility of the virus was mainly driven by the reduced number of days of exposure of household contacts to the cases due to the interventions ( appendix 2 pp 21, 29 ). The daily transmission probability between an infectious case and an exposed household contact was, however, less affected by the interventions ( table 3 ). More dramatic reduction in transmissibility for secondary cases than for primary cases was expected, as the household contacts were still exposed to primary cases during their incubation period before isolation or quarantine occurred ( appendix 2 pp 21, 29 ).

et al. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in 104 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: a retrospective analysis. Our study has several limitations. Although we have imputed asymptomatic infections among untested contacts in the early stage, bias cannot be ruled out as there was no protocol for laboratory testing and there could be unmeasured confounders not adjusted for in the imputation. Asymptomatic infections might still have been under-detected even after household contacts were universally tested. The overall proportion of asymptomatic infections after Feb 22 was 16%, somewhat lower than the 18% or 32% observed (depending on whether abnormal lung CT is counted as a clinical sign) in the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise.The GEE analysis was applied only to households with a single primary case, but these households tended to have more secondary cases aged 60 years or older ( appendix 2 p 39 ), which might affect the generalisability of the GEE results. In addition, our data do not offer strong evidence in favour of any particular scenario of the incubation and infectious periods, and the variation in results across the different assumptions should be considered as part of the uncertainty in these estimates. Finally, we merged epidemiologically linked households, but the mixing pattern between these households could be more complex than what was assumed.

Our study has implications for forecasting and control of the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. Differential susceptibility and infectivity between age groups, as well as other epidemiological parameters estimated in this study, are key inputs for modelling studies projecting the future trajectory of the pandemic. The relatively high infectivity of children in households should be considered carefully when making decisions around school reopenings, as infected children can pass the virus to their family members. Finally, given the vulnerability of infants to infection, their caregivers should be prioritised for vaccination."

Other countries with high COVID-19 cases include India, with more than 10.35 million cases, Brazil, with over 7.75 million cases, Russia, with more than 3.22 million cases, and the United Kingdom, with over 2.72 million cases.","cases, sarscov2, respiratory, study, copper, team, finds, virus, little, million, metal, surfaces, minute, inactivate",SarS,pandemic,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, continues to spread worldwide, with many countries reporting surging cases. The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols that hang in the air after an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes, or speaks.

These droplets can also spread through contaminating surfaces that are commonly touched (also known as ‘fomites’), such as doorknobs, tables, stair rails, and telephone handles, to name a few.

A new study by researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, has found that SARS-CoV-2 can inactivate on copper surfaces in as little as 1 minute. This is faster than the findings of previous studies in which it took as much as 4 hours before the virus was inactivated.

Copper as an antiviral agent

Copper has inherent antimicrobial qualities. When cleaned properly and regularly, commonly touched surfaces with uncoated copper alloy materials will effectively kill infectious pathogens.

In different forms, copper has been widely used in research and clinical settings to reduce the risk of bacterial and viral contamination. Hence, many studies have explored the use of copper surfaces and materials to combat the spreading of SARS-CoV-2.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that antimicrobial copper alloys are intended for the manufacture of touch surface components used in hospitals, laboratories, healthcare facilities, and other public, commercial, and residential buildings.

But how does copper inactivate viruses? Copper destroys the replication and propagation abilities of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other respiratory viruses. Further, copper can eradicate pathogenic organisms such as coronavirus, influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and fungi after a short period of exposure.

The study

The study, published on the preprint bioRxiv* server, showed that copper is a potent antiviral metal, that can cause rapid inactivation of pathogens on touch surfaces in just minutes. The team confirmed that the metal inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in as little as 1 minute.

In a past study by the researchers, they have shown that the human coronavirus 229E (Hu-CoV-229E), the virus that causes common colds, survives for more than five days on inanimate surfaces like glass, metal, and plastics. In the study, they showed the rapid inactivation of the virus within 10 minutes on various copper surfaces.

Another study, which was one of the first to show that SARS-CoV-2 can survive many days on inanimate objects, indicated that copper took 4 hours to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To explore the antiviral potential of copper further, the team repeated their previous work on SARS-CoV-2.

The researchers used metal coupons, including copper and stainless steel. From there, the team has spread infected cell supernatant preparations of SARS-CoV-2 over the meta coupons, 1 µl to simulate hand transfer or 10 µl to simulate respiratory droplet contact, and incubated at room temperature.

The team removed the virus from the test surfaces after various time points using an infection medium and assayed for infectious virus survival using a plaque assay.

Plaque Assay with SARS-CoV-2. A) uninfected VERO-E6 cells grown to confluency and stained with crystal violet to show take up by viable cells. B) confluent VERO-E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently stained with crystal violet to show dead and dying cells seen as clear plaques.

As little as one minute

The researchers found that there was no viable virus recovered from the copper or copper-coated stainless steel after 1 minute of exposure for metal coupons with 1 µl inoculum to simulate hand transfer.

Using a 10 µl inoculum to simulate respiratory droplet contact, this took over 10 minutes to dry when incubated at room temperature.

The team, however, noted that replacing existing metal surfaces with copper material is expensive. The team suggests that coating existing metal and plastic surfaces with copper may be a cheaper and cost-effective method to have a self-disinfecting surface.

Though it might be late to install these surfaces amid the pandemic, it can help in future viral outbreaks. It also has potential use in healthcare settings and other public areas where transmission is thought to be high, like hospitals and public transport.

Installing potent antimicrobial copper alloys and coatings into healthcare and public transport systems offers a simple defense in the fight to delay the spread of future pandemic diseases until vaccines become available,” the researchers wrote in the paper.

To date, the number of infected individuals has reached 85.67 million, and the virus has claimed over 1.85 million lives worldwide. The United States reports the highest case and death tolls, with more than 20.81 million cases, and 353,000 deaths. Other countries with high COVID-19 cases include India, with more than 10.35 million cases, Brazil, with over 7.75 million cases, Russia, with more than 3.22 million cases, and the United Kingdom, with over 2.72 million cases.

8,2021-01-21 00:00:00,Protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 could last eight months or more: Why declining antibodies don't spell disaster for long-lasting immunity,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/01/210106142648.htm,"Importantly the body also has immune cells called memory B cells at the ready.
If a person encounters SARS-CoV-2 again, these memory B cells could reactivate and produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to fight re-infection.
In fact, the researchers saw a 100-fold range in the magnitude of immune memory.
The fact that immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 is possible is also a good sign for vaccine developers.
Weiskopf emphasizes that the study tracked responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, not immune memory after vaccination.","declining, spell, sarscov2, covid19, immune, months, infection, study, disaster, cells, immunity, longlasting, responses, protective, memory, dont, antibodies",SarS,pandemic,"New data suggest that nearly all COVID-19 survivors have the immune cells necessary to fight re-infection.

The findings, based on analyses of blood samples from 188 COVID-19 patients, suggest that responses to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, from all major players in the ""adaptive"" immune system, which learns to fight specific pathogens, can last for at least eight months after the onset of symptoms from the initial infection.

""Our data suggest that the immune response is there -- and it stays,"" LJI Professor Alessandro Sette, Dr. Biol. Sci., who co-led the study with LJI Professor Shane Crotty, Ph.D., and LJI Research Assistant Professor Daniela Weiskopf, Ph.D.

""We measured antibodies, memory B cells, helper T cells and killer T cells all at the same time,"" says Crotty. ""As far as we know, this is the largest study ever, for any acute infection, that has measured all four of those components of immune memory.""

The findings, published in the January 6, 2021, online edition of Science, could mean that COVID-19 survivors have protective immunity against serious disease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus for months, perhaps years after infection.

The new study helps clarify some concerning COVID-19 data from other labs, which showed a dramatic drop-off of COVID-fighting antibodies in the months following infection. Some feared that this decline in antibodies meant that the body wouldn't be equipped to defend itself against reinfection.

Sette explains that a decline in antibodies is very normal. ""Of course, the immune response decreases over time to a certain extent, but that's normal. That's what immune responses do. They have a first phase of ramping up, and after that fantastic expansion, eventually the immune response contracts somewhat and gets to a steady state,"" Sette says.

The researchers found that virus-specific antibodies do persist in the bloodstream months after infection. Importantly the body also has immune cells called memory B cells at the ready. If a person encounters SARS-CoV-2 again, these memory B cells could reactivate and produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to fight re-infection.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses its ""spike"" protein to initiate infection of human cells, so the researchers looked for memory B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. They found that spike-specific memory B cells actually increased in the blood six months after infection.

COVID-19 survivors also had an army of T cells ready to fight reinfection. Memory CD4+ ""helper"" T cells lingered, ready to trigger an immune response if they saw SARS-CoV-2 again. Many memory CB8+ ""killer"" T cells also remained, ready to destroy infected cells and halt a reinfection.

The different parts of the adaptive immune system work together, so seeing COVID-fighting antibodies, memory B cells, memory CD4+ T cells and memory CD8+ T cells in the blood more than eight months following infection is a good sign.

""This implies that there's a good chance people would have protective immunity, at least against serious disease, for that period of time, and probably well beyond that,"" says Crotty.

The team cautions that protective immunity does vary dramatically from person to person. In fact, the researchers saw a 100-fold range in the magnitude of immune memory. People with a weak immune memory may be vulnerable to a case of recurrent COVID-19 in the future, or they may be more likely to infect others.

""There are some people that are way down at the bottom of how much immune memory they have, and maybe those people are a lot more susceptible to reinfection,"" says Crotty.

""It looks like people who have been infected are going to have some degree of protective immunity against re-infection,"" adds Weiskopf. ""How much protection remains to be established.""

The fact that immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 is possible is also a good sign for vaccine developers. Weiskopf emphasizes that the study tracked responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, not immune memory after vaccination.

""It is possible that immune memory will be similarly long lasting similar following vaccination, but we will have to wait until the data come in to be able to tell for sure,"" says Weiskopf. ""Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses lasts. The vaccine studies are at the initial stages, and so far have been associated with strong protection. We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.""

The researchers will continue to analyze samples from COVID-19 patients in the coming months and hope to track their responses 12 to 18 months after the onset of symptoms.

""We are also doing very detailed analyses at a much, much higher granularity on what pieces of the virus are recognized,"" says Sette. ""And we plan to evaluate the immune response not only following natural infection but following vaccination.""

The team is also working to understand how immune memory differs across people of different ages and how that may influence COVID-19 case severity.

The reason: a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which various modelling exercises have estimated to be up to 70% more transmissible than the previously circulating form of the virus.
In September, 2020, this variant represented just one in four new diagnoses of COVID-19, whereas by mid-December, this had increased to almost two thirds of new cases in London.

Other countries in the UK (Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) had also been reimposing and subsequently lifting restrictions, since each of the four nations is in charge of its own COVID-19 control plans.

For a while, the strategy in England appeared to have worked, with many areas that previously had high case incidence seeing rates drop sharply in November, including northwest England and Yorkshire, areas which had previously seen some of the highest incidence rates in the UK. However, it soon became apparent that the English lockdown had not had the same effect in every region. In Kent, a large county in the southeast, cases actually continued to increase during the lockdown, despite having the same restrictions as other regions. When, on Dec 2, 2020, England lifted its lockdown and moved back into a three-level tiered restrictions system, cases continued to increase sharply in Kent and then rapidly in Greater London and other parts of the southeast. And despite the approval of two vaccines in recent weeks, the UK now faces a race against time to vaccinate as many vulnerable and elderly people as possible.

The reason: a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which various modelling exercises have estimated to be up to 70% more transmissible than the previously circulating form of the virus. In September, 2020, this variant represented just one in four new diagnoses of COVID-19, whereas by mid-December, this had increased to almost two thirds of new cases in London. UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, decided with his scientific advisors that he had no credible alternative other than to impose even stricter restrictions on these parts of England, creating a new tier 4, which meant all non-essential shops and gyms closed, and people were asked to stay at home wherever possible (hospitality venues already had to close in tier 3).

However, until late December, 2020, the proportion of cases caused by the new variant were much lower in other parts of the country, with the northwest region that includes Liverpool and Manchester recording only 1 in 20 new cases of COVID-19 that were due to the new variant. As a result, many parts of England continued in the lower tier of restrictions, until on Dec 30, 2020, Johnson, in response to surging numbers of new diagnoses including an all-time high of 53 000 on Dec 29, 2020, decided to move all parts of England into tier 3 or 4. This effectively meant that no restaurants, bars, or other hospitality venues would be open on New Year's Eve. However, the latest data (early January, 2021) shows that cases due to the new variant are increasing in all areas of the country, although the south and southeast continue to be the worst affected.

Commentators have questioned the logic of this move, and called instead for an England-wide lockdown equivalent to tier 4 restrictions. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are already in such nationwide lockdowns. “It is good that the majority of the country is in tier 4 as there is evidence we need at least this level of restriction to prevent rapid spread of the new variant”, explains Andrew Hayward, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Inclusion Health Research at University College London, London, UK. Hayward, who is a member of the UK Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), adds: “The areas that are not currently in tier 4 can expect rapid increases in new variant cases which will likely lead to them needing to move into tier 4. Doing that now, instead of later, would prevent unnecessary hospitalisations and deaths and may decrease the length of time they need to be in tier 4.”

At the time that this article went to press, the UK Government had been determined that school children would all be returning to school, albeit in a staggered fashion, immediately after the Christmas and New Year holidays. However, this plan is now in doubt, with the government suggesting only primary school children and secondary school children who are in important exam years (essentially 16 and 18 year olds) will return to the classroom immediately. Then, on New Year's Day, 2021, the Government announced a sudden change in strategy—all primary schools in London were told not to reopen as planned on Jan 4. There were calls (including from teachers' unions) to delay reopening of primary schools in all of England for 2 weeks, but in a hastily arranged television interview on the morning of Sunday Jan 3, Johnson said that only primary schools in the areas worst affected by the new variant would not reopen. He told the BBC that there is “no doubt in my mind that schools are safe” but did not rule out further closures. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Kier Starmer, said in response that the virus was out of control and further school closures were “inevitable”. Starmer is among those calling for an immediate nationwide lockdown. Hayward explains that the decision to close schools or not could be the key factor in whether or not cases continue to increase. He said: “There is a high likelihood tier 4 will be insufficient to reduce the R number to below 1. Cases will continue to increase, albeit more slowly. This is based on the observation that the new strain increased in Kent and the southeast during lockdown, which is a more severe restriction than the current tier 4. Schools and universities being open may make the difference between being able to reduce R below 1 or not.” Following the latest announcements from the Prime Minster, Hayward adds that: “Even though schools have been provided with detailed guidance, and financial and practical support, it will be extremely challenging to implement mass testing of all pupils within the expected timeframes along with serial testing of classroom and other contacts of positive cases. The uptake and impact of school mass testing programmes is highly uncertain, as is the extent to which the new strain will increase transmission in schools and from school children to the wider community.”

According to research published on Dec 29, 2020, by the UK Health Agency Public Health England, the new variant appears to be no worse than the previous dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the risk of hospital admission, severity of illness, or mortality. The UK is confronting this new variant during the same month that two vaccines against the virus have been approved; the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccines. The Oxford vaccine in particular has raised hopes that the UK could regain control and turn the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic by as early as April 2021, since its storage requirements are a lot less complex than the deep cold required for the transport and storage of the Pfizer vaccine. This means that it will be far easier for vital vaccine supplies to reach, and be stored at, venues such as care homes for the elderly. Vaccinations with the new Oxford vaccine were due to begin across the UK on Jan 4, while vaccinations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine continue. In another key policy shift, the UK's medical experts said it was crucial to inoculate as many vulnerable people as possible with the first dose, since this would offer the most protection, rather than giving people the regular two-dose schedule of either vaccine. The second dose, they explained, can be given in the subsequent weeks or months after mortality and admissions have hopefully stablised.

At a media briefing on Dec 30, 2020, PM Johnson said: “The public must redouble its efforts to control the virus at this critical moment” before adding he was confident the country's situation will be “very much better” by April 5, 2021 (Easter weekend). “All of these measures in the end are designed to save lives and protect the NHS. For that very reason, I must ask you [the public] to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the new year safely at home.”

However, the new variant has piled additional pressure on to the speed at which vaccination must be achieved. Hayward is worried that, just as had been possible in the first wave, very vulnerable people, such as the homeless, could be ruthlessly exposed due to plunging winter temperatures and the failure of the UK government to so far provide local authorities with the resources to house homeless people in single room accommodation, mainly hotels, which are mostly standing empty due to the temporary death of the tourism industry.

Back in March, 2020, the government helped the appropriate agencies and organisations get everybody off the streets and into such accommodation. “Many homeless people have this time had to stay on the street because of the dangers of opening communal night shelters and alternative provision not being available. This new coronavirus variant especially could cause havoc and a huge surge of cases in people least equipped to face them”, says Hayward. The charity Crisis at Christmas has housed large numbers temporarily in single room accommodation over the Christmas period, but they will need to return to the streets in early January. Hayward warns that: “If there are severe cold weather spells after this it is likely communal shelters will need to open to prevent people freezing. Due to the government's failure so far to repeat their efforts of earlier this year, homeless people are currently facing a stark choice between the dangers of cold or the dangers of COVID-19.”

The UK remains one of the most badly affected countries. As of Dec 30, 2020, it had recorded more than 2 million cases of infection and more than 70 000 deaths. Driven by the new variant's increased infectiousness, the UK has reported more than 50 000 cases a day (a new record) in the last few days of December and the first few days of the new year. Almost 1000 deaths were reported on Dec 30, 2020, alone, and there are fears that the pandemic may get very much worse in the country before it gets better. However, the hope is that deaths and hospitalisations will plummet as the number of elderly and vulnerable people receiving the vaccine sharply increases in the coming weeks.

Random variation is an essential component of all living things. It drives diversity, and it is why there are so many different species. Viruses are no exception. Most viruses are experts at changing genomes to adapt to their environment. We now have evidence that the virus that causes Covid, SARS-CoV-2, not only changes, but changes in ways that are significant. This is the second in a series of articles on how the virus changes and what that means for humanity. Read the first piece here.

In May 2020, a man was hospitalized and, soon after, diagnosed with Covid-19. Within weeks he recovered and went home, only to be readmitted the following month when his Covid-19 symptoms came back with a vengeance. This time he was administered, at distinct yet overlapping intervals, a plurality of treatments, including the steroid dexamethasone; two rounds of remdesivir, an experimental drug therapy; and convalescent plasma from not one, not two, but three different patients. The man, his body unable to mount the resistance it needed to clear out the virus, succumbed to the disease in late August.

Over the course of the man’s hospitalization, researchers extracted, sequenced, and analyzed more than 20 different viral samples, a process they describe in a research paper currently undergoing peer review. They witnessed the virus evolving in real time, and over the course of 100-plus days noted the emergence of several mutations. One way to interpret this is that each time the man was given, via the blood plasma of previously recovered Covid-19 patients, a new mix of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the virus found new ways to resist neutralization. In other words, we might be looking at a classic case of immune evasion, a term that refers to the sum total of strategies a virus uses to evade or otherwise overcome the immune system.

Immune evasion is a potential outcome of viral variation. I discussed the mechanisms by which viral variation occurs in the first piece of this series—the substitutions, deletions, insertions, and other alterations to genetic code that, multiplied sufficiently in all the right places, can change how a virus functions significantly. Why this happens—the subject of this piece—is why most adaptations happen. When the coronavirus finds itself in an inhospitable environment, it must either adapt or die. What this means for us more broadly is that our attempts to counter the virus, whether at the individual and population level, push it down new evolutionary pathways. Though for most organisms this is a matter of course, that doesn’t mean it occurs without consequence.

Notably, prior to his Covid-19 diagnosis the aforementioned patient was already living with lymphoma, a cancer of the blood that begins in the immune system, and receiving injections of rituximab, a treatment therapy that can have immunosuppressive effects. Over the course of several plasma fusions, his body became a sort of testing ground for new variants of virus—not unlike what is now happening to populations around the world. If a barrage of antibody treatments increased evolutionary pressure on the virus responsible for his infection, it can be said that the slow but steady amalgamation of vaccinated, recovered, and other partially immune individuals is doing the same for the virus out in the wild.

What is remarkable is that some of the mutations observed in this one man, like the H69-V70 deletion, we’re now seeing in European variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have circulated among millions, including the so-called UK variant B.1.1.7. The H69-v70 deletion is found in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, the primary target of many Covid-19 drugs and some vaccines. Another study, published last month but also awaiting review, mapped how other kinds of spike mutations impacted the potency of antibodies in preparations of convalescent plasma. Those researchers found that mutations associated with E484, one of many sites pinpointed on the spike, had the biggest and most detrimental impact, reducing the protective capabilities of some antibodies more than tenfold. One of the variants to develop the E484 mutation is none other than 501.V2, also known as the South African variant.

Does this mean certain variants of SARS-CoV-2 will learn to evade our natural defenses against it, even in the majority of us who aren’t immunocompromised? Maybe, maybe not, but either way it remains a possibility we can’t afford to ignore. I already mentioned in my last piece that B.1.1.7 is far more contagious than its predecessor, and charts showing skyrocketing case counts across Britain elucidate the dangers of increased transmissibility better than words ever could. The explosive spread of B.1.1.7 foretells what might happen in the United States if we don’t patch up and ramp up our Covid-19 control measures, vaccine distribution included, sooner than later. In my next piece I’ll discuss the implications viral variation has for vaccines—and what we’ll have to do to make sure current vaccination campaigns proceed uninterrupted.

This has led many researchers to search for a candidate through drug repurposing, or screening clinically approved antivirals for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. While traditional antivirals, like remdesivir, target viral enzymes that are often subject to mutation, and thus to the development of drug resistance, antivirals that target the cell host proteins required for viral replication could have benefits, such as avoiding the development of resistance.

Working in preclinical models, researchers report that plitidepsin, a drug with limited clinical approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma, is more potent against SARS-CoV-2 than remdesivir—an antiviral that received FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in 2020.

The work is published in Science in the article, “Plitidepsin has potent preclinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the host protein eFF1A.”

SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins interact with the eukaryotic translation machinery. This opens up a door to combating infection by using inhibitors of translation, which have been shown to have antiviral effects. The authors assert that their results suggest that plitidepsin should be further evaluated as a COVID-19 therapy because it targets a host protein rather than a viral protein. Therefore, if treatment proves successful in humans, SARS-CoV-2 won’t be easily able to gain resistance against the drug through mutation.

In earlier work investigating host proteins likely to play a role in the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, including a study published in Science in October of last year, Kris White, PhD, assistant professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and colleagues, found that targeting the host translation machinery that is used in the replication of many viral pathogens could greatly inhibit SARS-CoV-2.

Based on this, they evaluated plitidepsin, a known inhibitor of a protein involved in host protein translation. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, the authors showed that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A. In addition to having limited clinical approval for treating multiple myeloma, it has also successfully completed a Phase I/II clinical study for the treatment of COVID-19.

Here, in human cell studies, plitidepsin demonstrated potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity—27.5-fold more so than remdesivir as tested in the same cell line. It also showed limited toxicity in cell culture. In a model of human lung cells, plitidepsin greatly reduced viral replication. After further experiments involving remdesivir and plitidepsin in vitro, the researchers suggest that plitidepsin has an additive effect with this approved drug and would be a potential candidate for a combined therapy.

The team of researchers demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. The mice who received the drug prophylactically had reduced viral load and lung inflammation compared to control mice.

This study, the authors noted, “establishes plitidepsin as a host-targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent with in vivo efficacy.” They continued: “We believe that our data and the initial positive results from PharmaMar’s clinical trial suggests that plitidepsin should be strongly considered for expanded clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.”"

About Merck’s therapeutic candidates

MK-7110 (formerly CD24Fc) is a potentially first-in-class investigational recombinant fusion protein that modulates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, principally by targeting a novel immune pathway checkpoint. Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. Full results from this study are expected in the first quarter of 2021. In December, Merck announced a supply agreement with the U.S. government to advance the manufacturing and initial distribution of MK-7110 (link).

Molnupiravir (MK-4482) is an oral novel investigational antiviral agent being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Bio. Molnupiravir is currently being evaluated in Phase 2/3 clinical trials in both the hospital and out-patient settings. The primary completion date for the Phase 2/3 studies is May 2021. The company anticipates initial efficacy data in the first quarter of 2021, which Merck plans to share publicly if clinically meaningful.

The scientists implemented deep phenotyping of both total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using 38-parameter CyTOF – a recently introduced technique for the characterization of T cells from convalescent individuals.
""Taking into consideration the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, our results suggest that strategies to boost the effector functions of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, including by vaccination, will be beneficial for decreasing COVID-19 mortality and helping to end this devastating pandemic"", say the authors of this medRxiv study.","sarscov2, study, recovery, patients, severe, features, players, cells, mortality, cell, covid19, key, sarscov2specific, decreasing",SarS,pandemic,"A recent US study, currently available on medRxiv* preprint server, supports a beneficial rather than immunopathologic role for effector T-cells during serious infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – and provides several important insights for our battle against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The ongoing and disruptive COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has shaken the world's healthcare systems and economy and claimed more than 2.22 million lives a year after its emergence.

Human adaptive immune system consists of cellular (T cell) and humoral (B cell) immunity and plays a crucial role in our defense against SARS-CoV-2. And while a coordinated interplay between the cellular and humoral arms seems to be indispensable for effective control, T cells appear to be capable of resolving the infection when B cell responses are deficient.

We know that a consistent feature of severe COVID-19 is T cell lymphopenia (i.e., an abnormally decreased level of lymphocytes in the blood), which is unlikely to merely indicate T cell sequestration in the infected lungs.

T cells as 'the most valuable players'?

T cells are likely key contributors to SARS-CoV-2 immunity; however, not much is known about the phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells related to recovery from severe COVID-19. That said, some newer studies have analyzed the features of T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

Considering that these antigen-specific cells can recognize virally-infected cells and generate specific antibodies directly, they hold the most potential to show a beneficial effect on recovery from disease. They are also principal targets of vaccination endeavors.

In this study, a research group led by Dr. Jason Neidleman from the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California in San Francisco (USA) aimed to define the features of T cells from individuals hospitalized in the ICU due to COVID-19 – including some that successfully recovered and some that succumbed to the disease.

A deep phenotyping approach

In this study, the researchers have compared total and SARS CoV-2-specific T cells in mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. Moreover, within the severe cases, an in-depth analysis of longitudinal specimens was conducted to pinpoint any predictive features linked to survival.

A total of 48 blood specimens from 34 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been analyzed, together with samples from 11 uninfected controls. Samples were taken from ICU patients classified as ""severe cases"" (68.8%), and from hospitalized patients without the need for the ICU, classified as ""moderate cases"" (31.2%).

The scientists implemented deep phenotyping of both total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using 38-parameter CyTOF – a recently introduced technique for the characterization of T cells from convalescent individuals.

This enabled the identification of unique phenotypic characteristics of viral-specific and bystander T cells associated with recovery from severe disease, which was then paired with a comprehensive examination of the features of T cells present in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.

The role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells

Relative to patients who have died, individuals in this study that recovered from severe forms of COVID-19 presented with elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of honing a physiological response known as homeostatic proliferation.

More specifically, the researchers observed an increased number of CD8-positive transitional memory T-cells in patients with mild symptoms and a higher number of activated, PD1-expressing T-cells in patients with severe symptoms.

Conversely, in fatal cases of COVID-19, there was an elevated number of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells and a time-dependent upsurge in activated bystander CXCR4+ T-cells (the latter subset of cells is also regarded as ""extrafollicular"" helper T cells).

When all results are taken into account, this study represents a model in which lung-homing T cells activated via bystander effect contribute to immunopathology, whereas a non-suppressive and robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response controls pathogenesis and stimulates recovery from severe COVID-19.

Implications for vaccination efforts

In a nutshell, this study's findings support a favorable rather than immunopathologic role for effector SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells during the severe acute infection, together with promoting recovery from COVID-19.

""Taking into consideration the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, our results suggest that strategies to boost the effector functions of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, including by vaccination, will be beneficial for decreasing COVID-19 mortality and helping to end this devastating pandemic"", say the authors of this medRxiv study.

In any case, since this study was correlative and phenotypical in nature, follow-up functional assays will be needed to establish any causal effect, as well as studies on larger cohorts of infected individuals.

By attacking the virus from many angles, the body has the tools to potentially recognize different SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The new research, published January 27, 2021 in Cell Report Medicine, is the most detailed analysis so far of which proteins on SARS-CoV-2 stimulate the strongest responses from the immune system's ""helper"" CD4+ T cells and ""killer"" CD8+ T cells.

""We are now armed with the knowledge of which parts of the virus are recognized by the immune system,"" says LJI Professor Alessandro Sette, Dr. Biol. Sci., who co-led the new study with LJI Instructor Alba Grifoni, Ph.D.

Sette and Grifoni have led research into immune responses to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic. Their previous studies, co-led by members of the LJI Coronavirus Task Force, shows that people can have a wide range of responses to the virus -- some people have strong immune responses and do well. Others have disjointed immune responses and are more likely to end up in the hospital.

As COVID-19 vaccines reach more people, LJI scientists are keeping an eye on how different people build immunity to SARS-CoV-2. They are also studying how T cells could combat different variants of SARS-CoV-2. This work takes advantage of the lab's expertise in predicting and studying T cell responses to viruses such as dengue and Zika.

""This is even more important with COVID-19 because it is a global pandemic, so we need to account for immune responses in different populations,"" says Grifoni.

The immune system is very flexible. By re-scrambling genetic material, it can make T cells that respond to a huge range of targets, or epitopes, on a pathogen. Some T cell responses will be stronger against some epitopes than others. Researchers call the targets that prompt a strong immune cells response ""immunodominant.""

For the new study, the researchers examined T cells from 100 people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. They then took a close look at the genetic sequence of the virus to separate the potential epitopes from the epitopes that these T cells would actually recognize.

Their analysis revealed that not all parts of the virus induce the same strong immune response in everyone. In fact, T cells can recognize dozens of epitopes on SARS-CoV-2, and these immunodominant sites also change from person to person. On average, each study participant had the ability to recognize about 17 CD8+ T cells epitopes and 19 CD4+ T cell epitopes.

This broad immune system response serves a few purposes. The new study shows that while the immune system often mounts a strong response against a particular site on the virus's ""spike"" protein called the receptor binding domain, this region is actually not as good at inducing a strong response from CD4+ helper T cells.

Without a strong CD4+ T cell response, however, people may be slow to mount the kind of neutralizing immune response that quickly wipes out the virus. Luckily, the broad immune response comes in handy, and most people have immune cells that can recognize sites other than the receptor binding domain.

Among the many epitopes they uncovered, the researchers identified several additional epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Grifoni says this is good news. By targeting many vulnerable sites on the spike protein, the immune system would still be able to fight infection, even if some sites on the virus change due to mutations.

""The immune response is broad enough to compensate for that,"" Grifoni says.

Since the announcement of the fast-spreading UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 (called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01), the researchers have compared the mutated sites on that virus to the epitopes they found. Sette notes that the mutations described in the UK variant for the spike protein affect only 8% of the epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells in this study, while 92% of the responses is conserved.

Sette emphasized that the new study is the results of months of long hours and international collaboration between labs at LJI; the University of California, San Diego; and researcher's at Australia's Murdoch University. ""This was a tremendous amount of work, and we were able to do it really fast because of our collaborations,"" he says.

EVANSTON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A new in vitro study done collaboratively by Utah State University and Northwestern University finds Xlear components (grapefruit seed extract and xylitol) significantly eliminates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The imaging research study component was performed at the BioCryo facility of Northwestern University’s NUANCE Center.

Using electron microscopy, we have visual evidence showing that xylitol and grapefruit seed extract (GSE) counters the virus. The GSE kills the virus, while the xylitol prevents the virus from attaching to the cell walls. The image shows SARS-CoV-2 viruses outside the cell and never attached, thereby preventing infection (Photo: Business Wire)

The study tested SARS-CoV-2 virus titers and LRV against a single concentration of Xlear nasal spray. According to the Study, “After a 25-minute contact time, the nasal spray reduced virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant reduction (P<0.001) of 2.5 log10 CCID50.” The Northwestern/Utah State Study is the newest in a string of studies to reach the conclusion that Xlear is effective against the SARS-CoV-2.

However, the study breaks new ground in two vital respects: “First, we conclude, in addition to countering SARS-CoV-2, Xlear is likely effective in preventing the spread of future H1N1 viruses, including the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, along with other viral epidemics. Given the more transmissible variants we now face, this is critical now,” said Professor Mark Cannon, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. “Second, using electron microscopy, we have visual evidence showing that xylitol and GSE counters the virus. The GSE kills the virus, while the xylitol prevents the virus from attaching to the cell walls. The image (attached) shows SARS-CoV-2 viruses outside the cell and never attached, thereby preventing infection,” added Dr. Cannon. The study postulates that xylitol acts as a decoy target for SARS-CoV-2, preventing virus attachment to the core protein on the cell wall.

The collaborative study concludes: “Because there are no risk factors in using the X/GSE combination therapy, and [Xlear] nasal spray is over the counter available without prescription, and [Xlear] allows for comfortable long term mask wearing, adoption of this preventive anti-viral therapy should be encouraged.”

However, this is the third pandemic in recent times caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses.

A new paper published in the journal Medicine seeks to compare the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with the earlier SARS-CoV epidemic to understand the best way to respond to it sensitively and flexibly. This involves early detection, using multiple screening tests, followed by management of the clinical features as required, in order to prevent disease-related injury.

Contagious virus

The period of maximum SARS-CoV-2 transmission is often the presymptomatic period, 48–72 hours prior to the clinical presentation. The increased contact with people during this period, and less attention to protective measures, due to lack of awareness of the presence of infectious disease, predisposes to a higher rate of spread at this time.

A novel mutation at the interface of the S1 and S2 subunits of the viral spike protein, introducing a furin cleavage site, makes the SARS-CoV-2 more infectious than the SARS-CoV, especially early in infection. A classic example is the occurrence of 621 cases onboard a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, beginning with a single infected individual.

Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, involving close contact between an index case and others. While the virus has been isolated from feces, the importance of urine and feces in transmission remains unclear.

Pandemic spread

SARS-CoV-2 was poised to cause a pandemic; that is, ""states of an infectious disease that significantly increase in populations around the world with infections occur more or less simultaneously."" While the earlier outbreak of SARS from Guangdong, China, involved just over 8,400 people in 25 countries or regions of the world, the currently circulating virus has caused over 109 million cases, with more than 2.4 million deaths, involving 192 countries and territories worldwide.

Longer course

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be set to linger in the world for a longer period than the SARS outbreak that settled in seven months. More than a year after the first case was reported, infection rates continue to be high in many regions of the world.

An unusual feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is how its epicenter keeps shifting, from China's Wuhan to other countries in Asia, as well as to Europe, and then to the US and Australia.

Economic consequences

While the Chinese economy accounted for only 4% of the global economy back in 2002, during the SARS epidemic, it now makes up 17%, as the second-ranked world economy. However, it has been affected severely by the current pandemic, raising the possibility of hitting a nadir not seen in the last three decades.

In the UK, universal credit was expected to be required by 3.5 million more people than before. US stocks are at the lowest point since 1987, with a ricochet effect on 11 other countries and regions. China being the biggest manufacturer and crude oil importer, its economic downturn is bound to set off a global recession as well.

Preventive and therapeutic measures

The mainstay of COVID-19 containment was preventive non-pharmaceutical interventions, including social distancing, scrupulous regular handwashing after possible contact with contaminated surfaces, surface disinfection, wearing masks when in public spaces, and self-isolation for contacts of infected individuals.

The Chinese health authorities have set forth a manual on COVID-19 epidemiology, signs and symptoms, clinical grading, and treatment, as well as distinguishing features between COVID-19 and other upper respiratory infections or flu-like illnesses.

This document, ""Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment,"" also helps to identify cases and notify the relevant authorities, in addition to the right management in all grades of severity. Criteria for discharge and follow-up are also outlined, as well as precautions to prevent the dissemination of the infection.

Chinese management of COVID-19

In contrast to the delayed awareness of the SARS outbreak, which led to misinformation and panic buying, the current pandemic was characterized by a more rapid response with greater transparency. Immediately after the identification of the first case of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, appropriate epidemiological measures were set up.

Virus samples were taken, the epidemiological trail was investigated, and guidelines on therapy, were released within 45 days of the first case, and a rapid response was initiated. ""Eight rumor-mongers were dealt with according to the law,"" the report says. A database was set up within a year of the first case in China.

Rapid development of testing kits

Testing kits were rapidly manufactured and marketed by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), with adequate efficiency and sensitivity. An acceptable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was made available only ten months after the first case of SARS, in the last outbreak in 2003.

In contrast, NMPA's emergency protocol brought a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing kit to the market within two weeks. With the incorporation of Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR test, it became possible to get the test results within three hours.

Mobile hospitals

Another innovation was the mobile emergency hospital, built on a large scale to treat and follow up less sick patients, reserving the main hospitals for severe COVID-19 patients. Dating from the 1960s, this concept offers medical and technological support on a platform that allows rapid deployment where required.

Though the concept originated in Vietnam, with the US military, it was adopted for disaster situations and military operations not involving war. In the current situation, the government took over sports and exhibition halls and schools for mobile hospitals. The Wuhan outbreak was successfully contained in less than three months.

From the onset of the pandemic to March 10th, 2020, mobile emergency hospitals were set up to treat over 12,000 patients, and dismantled, having fulfilled their purpose. This is in contrast to the less than 700 cases of SARS that were treated in 2003.

Lockdown in China

SARS-CoV-2 triggered the first lockdown in over 70 years in China, involving 16 cities. The pandemic appeared near the time of the Spring Festival, where almost 3 billion visits were made to meet one's family, typically at their hometown. This comes to about 70 million trips a day over 40 days of the festival-related holiday season.

In view of the estimated spread of the virus to over 50% of the population in nearly 370 other cities in China, from Wuhan, and almost the whole population of the four largest metropolises, the authorities clamped down on public transport by road, rail, subway and air, to and from 16 cities.

A chain of command was set up to coordinate the Chinese response to COVID-19. Local governments took their cue from the special command group of the Chinese National Health Commission. They, in turn, briefed district governments on the required arrangements.

Community leaders and volunteers helped to execute the containment measures, from checking temperatures to isolating patients, and from delivering food to translating for foreigners.

The biocontainer approach used by the US government will help protect people traveling back to China from overseas from the infection until they can reach the right center for treatment.

Accident insurance for medical workers

Though medical workers were not reimbursed by insurance for the risks they ran during the SARS outbreak, the current pandemic saw temporary work subsidies and increased subsidies for preventive health and epidemic containment work. Over 20 insurance firms in China donated substantial amounts of insurance to frontline medical workers, over and above government subsidies.

Military and volunteer cooperation

Military-style management of a huge corps of student volunteers helped contain the pandemic, compared to the earlier outbreak of SARS. Over 30,000 volunteers have been engaged in COVID-19 quarantine and prevention work, for a total of over 18 million hours.

What are the implications?

The report commends China's efforts to contain the outbreak within its border by its ""rigorous containment and quarantine efforts,"" citing these as responsible for China's emergence from the active phase of the pandemic, earliest among the world's countries.

However, notification of the Chinese Center for Disease Control occurred nearly two months after the first case of novel pneumonia, delaying the opportunity to clamp down on viral spread early in the course of the outbreak. This was a failure of the surveillance system introduced after the SARS outbreak.

Thirdly, the preparedness level in terms of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other aids was too low, with most hospitals keeping only a month's stock on hand. This led to an initial severe shortage of medical supplies required to deal with the virus's spread and its treatment.

The process of distributing PPE from the centers where it arrived was often hampered by bureaucratic procedures, leading to local shortages despite its supply from the national stockpile. Some medical workers were also unnecessarily exposed to the virus as a result.

The researchers aim to disseminate their newly developed early warning mechanism for future pandemics, and to address the deficiencies observed in local logistic units, allowing multi-channel distribution in case of emergency while maintaining adequate stockpiles."

The path that SARS-CoV-2 might take to become an endemic virus is challenging to predict, but society does have some control over it.","vaccine, probably, sarscov2, coronavirus, transmission, virus, endemic, heres, immunity, stay, infection, vaccines, means",SarS,pandemic,"For much of the past year, life in Western Australia has been coronavirus-free. Friends gathered in pubs; people kissed and hugged their relatives; children went to school without temperature checks or wearing masks. The state maintained this enviable position only by placing heavy restrictions on travel and imposing lockdowns — some regions entered a snap lockdown at the beginning of the year after a security guard at a hotel where visitors were quarantined tested positive for the virus. But the experience in Western Australia has provided a glimpse into a life free from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. If other regions, aided by vaccines, aimed for a similar zero-COVID strategy, then could the world hope to rid itself of the virus?

It’s a beautiful dream but most scientists think it’s improbable. In January, Nature asked more than 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers and virologists working on the coronavirus whether it could be eradicated. Almost 90% of respondents think that the coronavirus will become endemic — meaning that it will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come (see 'Endemic future').

Source: Nature survey

“Eradicating this virus right now from the world is a lot like trying to plan the construction of a stepping-stone pathway to the Moon. It’s unrealistic,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

But failure to eradicate the virus does not mean that death, illness or social isolation will continue on the scales seen so far. The future will depend heavily on the type of immunity people acquire through infection or vaccination and how the virus evolves. Influenza and the four human coronaviruses that cause common colds are also endemic: but a combination of annual vaccines and acquired immunity means that societies tolerate the seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without requiring lockdowns, masks and social distancing.

More than one-third of the respondents to Nature’s survey thought that it would be possible to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from some regions while it continued to circulate in others. In zero-COVID regions there would be a continual risk of disease outbreaks, but they could be quenched quickly by herd immunity if most people had been vaccinated. “I guess COVID will be eliminated from some countries, but with a continuing (and maybe seasonal) risk of reintroduction from places where vaccine coverage and public-health measures have not been good enough,” says Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK.

“The virus becoming endemic is likely, but the pattern that it will take is hard to predict,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist from Georgetown University, who is based in Seattle, Washington. This will determine the societal costs of SARS-CoV-2 for 5, 10 or even 50 years in the future (see ‘Coronavirus: here to stay?’).

Childhood virus

Five years from now, when childcare centres call parents to tell them that their child has a runny nose and a fever, the COVID-19 pandemic might seem a distant memory. But there’s a chance the virus that killed more than 1.5 million people in 2020 alone will be the culprit.

This is one scenario that scientists foresee for SARS-CoV-2. The virus sticks around, but once people develop some immunity to it — either through natural infection or vaccination — they won’t come down with severe symptoms. The virus would become a foe first encountered in early childhood, when it typically causes mild infection or none at all, says Jennie Lavine, an infectious-disease researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

Scientists consider this possible because that’s how the four endemic coronaviruses, called OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1, behave. At least three of these viruses have probably been circulating in human populations for hundreds of years; two of them are responsible for roughly 15% of respiratory infections. Using data from previous studies, Lavine and her colleagues developed a model that shows how most children first come down with these viruses before the age of 6 and develop immunity to them1. That defence wanes pretty quickly so it is not sufficient to block reinfection entirely, but it seems to protect adults from getting sick, says Lavine. Even in children, the first infection is relatively mild.

Whether immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will behave in the same way is so far unclear. A large study of people who have had COVID-19 suggests that their levels of neutralizing antibodies — which help to block reinfection — start to decline after around six to eight months2. But their bodies also make memory B cells, which can manufacture antibodies if a new infection arises, and T cells that can eliminate virus-infected cells, says Daniela Weiskopf, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, who co-authored the study. It’s yet to be established if this immune memory can block viral reinfection — although cases of reinfection have been recorded, and new viral variants might make them more likely, they are still considered rare.

Weiskopf and her colleagues are still tracking the immune memory of people infected with COVID-19 to see if it persists. If most people develop life-long immunity to the virus, either through natural infection or vaccination, then the virus is unlikely to become endemic, she says. But immunity might wane after a year or two — and already there are hints that the virus can evolve to escape it. More than half the scientists who responded to Nature’s survey think waning immunity will be one of the main drivers of the virus becoming endemic.

Because the virus has spread around the world, it might seem that it could already be classed as endemic. But because infections continue to increase worldwide, and with so many people still susceptible, scientists still technically class it as in a pandemic phase. In the endemic phase, the number of infections becomes relatively constant across years, allowing for occasional flare-ups, says Lavine.

To reach this steady state could take a few years or decades, depending on how quickly populations develop immunity, says Lavine. Allowing the virus to spread unchecked would be the fastest way to get to that point — but that would result in many millions of deaths. “That path has some huge costs,” she says. The most palatable path is through vaccination.

Vaccines and herd immunity

Countries that have begun distributing COVID-19 vaccines soon expect to see a reduction in severe illness. But it will take longer to see how effectively vaccines can reduce transmission. Data from clinical trials suggest that vaccines that prevent symptomatic infection might also stop a person from passing on the virus.

If vaccines do block transmission — and if they remain effective against newer variants of the virus — it might be possible to eliminate the virus in regions where enough people are vaccinated so that they can protect those who are not, contributing to herd immunity. A vaccine that is 90% effective at blocking transmission will need to reach at least 55% of the population to achieve temporary herd immunity as long as some social distancing measures — such as face masks and many people working from home — remain in place to keep transmission in check, according to a model3 developed by Alexandra Hogan at Imperial College London and her colleagues. (A vaccine would need to reach almost 67% of people to provide herd immunity if all social distancing measures were lifted.) But if the rate of transmission increases because of a new variant, or if a vaccine is less effective than 90% at blocking transmission, vaccine coverage will need to be greater to blunt circulation.

Vaccinating even 55% of the population will be challenging in many countries. “The virus will stick around if parts of the world don’t get vaccinated,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious-disease researcher at Columbia University in New York City.

Even if the virus remains endemic in many regions, global travel will probably resume when severe infections are reduced to levels that health services can cope with, and when a high proportion of people who are vulnerable to severe illness have been vaccinated, says Dye.

Similar to flu?

The 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed more than 50 million people, is the yardstick by which all other pandemics are measured. It was sparked by a type of virus known as influenza A, which originated in birds. Almost all cases of influenza A since then, and all subsequent flu pandemics, have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus. These descendants circulate the globe, infecting millions of people each year. Flu pandemics occur when populations are naive to a virus; by the time a pandemic virus becomes seasonal, much of the population has some immunity to it. Seasonal flu still has a significant toll globally, claiming roughly 650,000 lives per year.

Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, thinks the coronavirus might follow a similar path. “I do think SARS-CoV-2 will become a less serious problem and something like flu,” he says. Shaman and others say the virus could also settle into a seasonal pattern of annual winter outbreaks similar to flu.

Flu seems to evolve much faster than SARS-CoV-2, allowing it to sneak past the immune system’s defences. This feature is why flu vaccines need to be reformulated each year; that might not be needed for SARS-CoV-2.

Still, the coronavirus might be able to dodge immunity acquired by infection, and possibly outsmart vaccines. Already, laboratory studies show that neutralizing antibodies in the blood of people who have had COVID-19 are less capable of recognizing a viral variant first identified in South Africa (called 501Y.V2), than variants that circulated earlier in the pandemic4. That is probably because of mutations in the virus’s spike protein, which vaccines target. Trial results suggest that some vaccines might be less effective against 501Y.V2 than against other variants, and some vaccine makers are exploring redesigns of their products.

Still, the immune system has lots of tricks up its sleeve, and can respond to many features of the virus, not just spike, says Lavine. “The virus is probably going to have to go through lots of mutations to make a vaccine ineffective,” she says. Preliminary trial results also suggest that vaccines can protect people with 501Y.V2 against severe disease, says Rasmussen.

More than 70% of the researchers surveyed by Nature think that immune escape will be another driver of the virus’s continuing circulation (see 'Driving factors'). This would not be a first for a human coronavirus. In a study5 yet to be peer reviewed, Bloom and his colleagues show that the endemic coronavirus 229E has evolved so that neutralizing antibodies in the blood of people infected with the viral variant circulating in the late 1980s and early 1990s are much less effective against more recent variants. People are reinfected with 229E over their lifetime, and Bloom suspects that it might be harder to stave off the variants that have evolved to escape previous immunity. But scientists don’t know whether these reinfections are associated with worse symptoms. “I would expect that over many years, accumulated mutations to SARS-CoV-2 will more completely erode neutralizing antibody immunity as we saw for CoV-229E, although I can’t say for sure how the rates will compare among the two coronaviruses,” says Bloom.

Bloom thinks it’s probable that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will need to be updated, possibly every year. But even then, immunity from either past vaccination or infection will probably blunt serious disease, he says. And Lavine notes that even if people are reinfected, this might not be a big deal. With the endemic coronaviruses, frequent reinfections seem to boost immunity against related variants and typically people experience only mild symptoms, she says. But it is possible that vaccines won’t stop some people developing severe symptoms, in which case the virus will continue to be a significant burden on society, says Shaman.

Measles-like virus

If SARS-CoV-2 vaccines block infection and transmission for life, the virus might become something akin to measles. “It’s probably less likely [than other scenarios] but it’s still possible,” says Shaman.

With a highly effective measles vaccine — two doses and a person is protected for life — the measles virus has been eliminated in many parts of the world. Before a vaccine was developed in 1963, major epidemics killed about 2.6 million people, mostly children, a year. Unlike flu vaccines, the immunization for measles has never needed to be updated because the virus has yet to evolve in ways that evade the immune system.

Measles is still endemic in parts of the world with insufficient immunization. In 2018, a global resurgence killed more than 140,000 people. A similar situation could emerge with SARS-CoV-2 if people decline vaccines. A survey of more than 1,600 US citizens found that more than one-quarter would definitely or probably decline a COVID-19 vaccine, even if it were free and deemed safe (see go.nature.com/3a9b44s). “How successful we are at addressing those concerns will determine how many people get the vaccine and how many remain susceptible,” says Rasmussen.

Animal reservoirs

The future of SARS-CoV-2 will also depend on whether it establishes itself in a wild animal population. Several diseases brought under control persist because animal reservoirs, such as insects, provide chances for pathogens to spill back into people. These include yellow fever, Ebola and chikungunya virus.

SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats, but it might have passed to people through an intermediate host. The virus can readily infect many animals, including cats, rabbits and hamsters. It is particularly infectious in mink, and mass outbreaks on mink farms in Denmark and the Netherlands have led to huge animal culls. The virus has also passed between minks and people. If it became established in a wild-animal population and could spill back into people, it would be very difficult to control, says Osterholm. “There is no disease in the history of humankind that has disappeared from the face of the Earth when zoonotic disease was such an important part of, or played a role in, the transmission,” he says.

The path that SARS-CoV-2 might take to become an endemic virus is challenging to predict, but society does have some control over it. In the next year or two, countries can reduce transmission with control measures until enough people have been vaccinated either to achieve herd immunity or to drastically reduce the severity of infections. That would significantly reduce deaths and severe disease, says Osterholm. But if countries abandon strategies to reduce spread and let the virus reign unchecked then “the darkest days of the pandemic are still ahead of us”, he says."

KEVIN MCCARTHY AND PAUL DUPREX

When SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, first emerged, scientists expected it to evolve slowly because the virus copies its big RNA genome with a polymerase that also corrects errors, thus minimizing the chance for certain types of mutations. This enzyme functionality isn’t present in other RNA viruses such as influenza and HIV, which accumulate single nucleotide polymorphisms, where one nucleotide is substituted for another, much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 does.

This genomic stability was thought to be good news for vaccine design, but it’s become apparent in recent months, with the emergence of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and other variants, that SARS-CoV-2 is mutable—and might put up a fight against neutralizing antibodies that go after the spike protein of the virus. In a study posted as a preprint in November and published February 3 in Science, researchers showed that SARS-CoV-2 tends to delete portions of RNA that encode the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike, a mutation that its proofreader can’t detect. These findings and those of other groups offer an explanation for how new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise and escape antibody recognition by the host immune system.

Deletion “represents a way to rapidly alter an entire stretch of amino acids and more rapidly alter the structures that those amino acids are contributing to,” says coauthor Kevin McCarthy, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh. These mutations “could accelerate [SARS-CoV-2] evolution and then complement mutations that it’s already making.”

The project started when two physicians at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center contacted Paul Duprex, a virologist and the director of the Center for Vaccine Research at Pitt. The doctors had an immunocompromised cancer patient who passed away after a SARS-CoV-2 infection that lasted 74 days and did not respond to common treatments, including Remdesivir and dexamethasone. So Duprex and his team took a look at the viral genome to see if they could figure out why the infection lasted so long.

From samples aspirated from the patient’s trachea 72 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, the researchers isolated viral RNA from several SARS-CoV-2 variants, which likely evolved from one initial infection during the long illness, and sequenced the S gene, which encodes the spike protein. They found two variants that contained different three-nucleotide deletions in the NTD of the spike protein.

Duprex mentioned the findings to McCarthy, who, with help from collaborators, combed through the nearly 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences that had been deposited by the end of October 2020 in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. The researchers found 1,108 viral genomes that had deletions of varying lengths in the S gene, 90 percent of which were located at one of four sites in the NTD.

Many of the deletions were in patient samples that appeared to be persistent infections, similar to the one the Pittsburgh patient experienced. And some of the most concerning new variants, including B.1.1.7, initially identified in the UK, and B.1.351, first spotted in South Africa, have one or two of these short deletions in the NTD, along with a cluster of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike, which must attach to the ACE2 receptor in order to enter host cells.

Deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence (horizontal cyan bar) affect the shape of different parts of the protein (cyan). The bar graph at left shows the relative frequency of recurrent deletions in the correspondingly colored parts of the spike protein. Deletions tend to occur outside the region that binds to cells at the beginning of the infection. KEVIN MCCARTHY AND PAUL DUPREX

The researchers then tested whether six of these deletions would disrupt antibody binding. Three of those deletions and one deletion combination in the NTD eliminated the ability of an antibody previously isolated from a convalescent patient to neutralize the virus. This specific antibody completely lost its effectiveness, but convalescent serum, which contains a full set of antibodies, not just one, did neutralize each of these variants.

Antibodies “are swarms looking at the different shapes of different parts of the molecule, so it’s not all or nothing whenever we’re thinking about the swarms of antibodies, but it absolutely is all or nothing when you’re thinking about this particular antibody, which binds at this particular space,” explains Duprex.

NTD deletion variants and vaccine potency

The next steps are “to catalog the effects of these deletions on a large collection of plasma samples,” including from survivors and vaccine recipients, Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York who was not part of the work, tells The Scientist. She says this could help answer questions about vaccine efficacy, reinfection, and if vaccines design should account for deletions. These mutations are “just a part of all the variation seen in spike at the moment.”

The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two approved for use in the United States, both include RNA encoding the full-length spike protein. Once injected into a person, the RNA is translated into protein, and the recipient’s immune system then responds to and develops a memory of the encounter. According to a COVID-19 vaccine candidate tracker published on February 12 by the World Health Organization, 11 vaccines that initiate immunity to just the RBD of the spike are at various stages of clinical trials.

“The message to the vaccine world is that it was the correct choice to use full length spike . . . and those others, who based [strategies] only on the RBD, are missing” parts of the protein, in this case the rest of the spike, particularly the NTD, which patients have been shown to mount an antibody response to, says Gregory Ippolito, an immunologist at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin who was not involved in the work. Ippolito and his colleagues, part of a team led by George Georgiou at UT Austin, posted a preprint to bioRxiv in December showing that more than 80 percent of the antibodies to portions of the spike in four convalescent patients bound to domains other than the RBD. Thus, vaccines that leave out portions of the spike protein don’t give recipients’ immune systems the chance to develop a full complement of antibodies to protect them from the virus, and risk becoming less effective when the spike protein mutates.

The study also points to considerations for therapeutics that give passive immunity, such as antibody cocktails, says Jason Lavinder, another member of the team at UT Austin. It’s important to include “in those cocktails not just RBD-directed antibodies, but also NTD-directed antibodies.”

While the World Health Organization (WHO) continues its mission to Wuhan investigating the origin and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, a new study led by scientists from Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, and Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, shows that SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) are circulating in animals as far away as Thailand. The study, published in Nature Communications today, reported that high levels of neutralising antibodies against the virus were present in both bats and pangolins found in the Southeast Asian country. The study further indicates that more SC2r-CoVs are likely to be discovered in the region. Southeast Asia with its large and diverse bat populations may be a more likely hotspot for such viruses.

“This is an important discovery in the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2, which was made possible by rapid application of cutting-edge technology through transparent international collaboration,” said Dr Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, from Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok Thailand.

What

The rise of several significant variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has attracted the attention of health and science experts worldwide. In an editorial published today in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, experts from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, outline how these variants have arisen, concerns about whether vaccines currently authorized for use will continue to protect against new variants, and the need for a global approach to fighting SARS-CoV-2 as it spreads and acquires additional mutations.

The article was written by NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.; John R. Mascola, M.D., director of NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC); and Barney S. Graham, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of NIAID’s VRC.

The authors note that the overlapping discovery of several SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to confusing terms used to name them. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants is so recent that the World Health Organization and other groups are still developing appropriate nomenclature for the different variants.

Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged over the last several months. The authors note that the variants known as B.1.1.7 (first identified in the United Kingdom) and B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa) concern scientists because of emerging data suggesting their increased transmissibility.

Variants can carry several different mutations, but changes in the spike protein of the virus, used to enter cells and infect them, are especially concerning. Changes to this protein may cause a vaccine to be less effective against a particular variant. The authors note that the B.1.351 variant may be partially or fully resistant to certain SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies currently authorized for use as therapeutics in the United States.

The recognition of all new variants, including a novel emergent strain (20C/S:452R) in California, requires systematic evaluation, according to the authors. The rise of these variants is a reminder that as long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it has the potential to evolve into new variants, the authors stress. Therefore, the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 will require robust surveillance, tracking, and vaccine deployment worldwide.

The authors also note the need for a pan-coronavirus vaccine. Once researchers know more about how the virus changes as it spreads, it may be possible to develop a vaccine that protects against most or all variants. While similar research programs are already in place for other diseases, such as influenza, the changing nature of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that they will be necessary for this virus.

Cell and culture conditions

Vero E6 cells (a gift from M, Müller) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× non-essential amino acids, 100 units ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (N)23,24 were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1× non-essential amino acids, 100 units ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 500 μg ml−1 G418 and 10 μg ml−1 puromycin. Twenty-four hours before electroporation, the BHK cells expressing SARS-CoV N were treated with 1 μg ml−1 doxycyclin to express SARS-CoV N protein. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

Recombinant proteins

The Expi293 Expression system (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to produce hACE2 and S. Mammalian expression plasmids were constructed to encode codon-optimized Fc(human IgG1)-tagged hACE2 (hACE2–Fc) or polyhistidine-tagged S (S and S(D614G)), which contain the full-length ectodomain of S (residues 1–1208, with a mutated furin cleavage site and K986P/V987P substitutions). Expi293F cells were transfected with the plasmids and cultured at 37 °C with 8% CO 2 at a shaking speed of 125 rpm. The supernatant was collected on day 5 by centrifugation at 3,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The hACE2–Fc protein was purified using HiTrap Protein A column (GE Life Sciences) in elution buffer containing 0.1 M citric acid, pH 3.0. S was purified using HisTrap FF column (GE Life Sciences) in elution buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl and 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. The eluents were desalted using Zeba spin desalting column 7K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified proteins were further concentrated on Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters 50K NMWL (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified using Qubit protein assay (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Biolayer interferometry assay

Affinity between hACE2–Fc and S1 (ABclonal, RP01262), S1(D614G) (ABclonal, RP01287), S or S(D614G) was evaluated using Octet RED96 instrument (ForteBio) at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 1,000 rpm. Following 20 min of prehydration of anti-human Fc capture biosensors and 1 min of sensor check, 7.5 nM hACE2–Fc in 10× kinetic buffer (ForteBio) was loaded onto the surface of biosensors for 5 min. After 1.5 min of baseline equilibration, 5 min of association was conducted with 25 to 200 nM of S1 or S1(D614G), or with 10–100 nM of S or S(D614G), followed by 5 min of dissociation in the same buffer used for baseline equilibration. The data were corrected by subtracting the reference sample; a 1:1 binding model with global fit was used for the determination of affinity constants.

Flow cytometry

A stable clone of BHK–hACE2 cells was pelleted and resuspended in reaction buffer (PBS pH7.4 with 0.02% Tween-20 and 4% BSA) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per ml. One hundred microlitres per well of the cells were aliquoted into a round-bottom 96-well plate and incubated on ice for at least 5 min. Polyhistidine-tagged S1 (40591-V08H) and S1(D614G) (40591-V08H3) and Fc-tagged S1 (40591-v02H) and S1(D614G) (40591-v02H3) proteins were purchased from Sino Biological, and diluted in reaction buffer on ice. Fifty microlitres of S1 diluents were added into corresponding wells of cells and incubated on ice for 20 min with shaking. After incubation, cells were washed in 200 μl PBST washing solution (PBS pH7.4 with 0.02% Tween-20) once, and then 100 μl of 1:300 diluted secondary antibody (ThermoFisher cat. no. A-21091 for the Fc tag and ThermoFisher cat. no. MA1-21315-647 for the polyhistidine tag) was added into each well of cells, mixed and incubated on ice with shaking for 15 min. After washing twice, cells were resuspended in 200 μl PBST and analysed using a BD FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer. Data were processed using Flowjo v.10.6.1. Results for BHK control cells (which do not express hACE2) and the gating strategy are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2.

Generation of infectious cDNA clones using transformation-associated recombination cloning and rescue of recombinant viruses

To introduce the mutation for the D614G substitution into the S gene, PCR mutagenesis (Supplementary Table 1) was performed on the pUC57 plasmid containing SARS-CoV-2 fragment 1010 using a Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLab). Both S and SD614G infectious cDNA clones were generated using in-yeast transformation-associated recombination cloning method as previously described10. In vitro transcription was performed for EagI-cleaved YAC and PCR-amplified SARS-CoV-2 N gene using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA production system (Promega) as previously described4. Transcribed capped mRNA was electroporated into baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21 cells) expressing SARS-CoV N protein. Electroporated cells were cocultured with susceptible Vero E6 cells to produce passage 0 of recombinant SARS-CoV-2D614 and SARS-CoV-2G614. Subsequently, progeny viruses were used to infect fresh Vero E6 cells to generate passage 1 stocks for downstream experiments.

Virus growth kinetics and plaque assay

The characterization of virus growth kinetics in Vero E6 was performed as previously described10. Twenty-four hours before infection, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells per ml. After washing once with PBS, cells were inoculated with viruses at multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS followed by supply with appropriate culture medium.

PFUs per ml of recombinant SARS-CoV-2D614 and SARS-CoV-2G614 were determined by plaque assay in a 24-well format. One day before infection, Vero E6 cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells per ml. After washing once with PBS, cells were inoculated with viruses serially diluted in cell culture medium at 1:10 dilution. After 1 h of incubation, inoculum was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and subsequently overlaid with 1:1 mix of 2.4% Avicel and 2× DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 200 units ml−1 penicillin and 200 μg ml−1 streptomycin. After 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin before stained with crystal violet.

Statistical significance was determined by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test without adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Infection of human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells

Primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures (MucilAir EP02, Epithelix Sàrl) were purchased and handled according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human NBE cells were purchased (from Emory University) and cultured according to recommended protocols. The human nasal epithelial cultures were inoculated with 0.5 × 105 PFU per well, or mixtures of 1:1, 10:1 and 1:10 of SARS-CoV-2D614 and SARS-CoV-2G614. Human NBE cell cultures were inoculated with 1.0 × 105 PFU per well, or with the wild-type isolates SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 (SARS-CoV-2D614) or SARS-CoV-2/Massachusetts/VPT1/2020 (SARS-CoV-2G614), at 2 × 105 TCID 50 per well. For competition experiments, human NBE cells were inoculated with 1:1 or 9:1 mixed SARS-CoV-2D614 and SARS-CoV-2G614 at 1 × 105 PFU per well. After incubation at 33 °C for 1 or 2 h, for human nasal epithelial or human NBE cell cultures, respectively, inoculum was removed (or collected for human NBE as 2-h samples), cells were washed, and subsequently incubated (as indicated) at 33 °C, 37 °C or 39 °C. To monitor viral replication, apical washes were collected every 24 h. All titre were determined by standard plaque assay or TCID 50 on Vero E6 cells.

For competition experiments, viral RNA was extracted from apical washes using the QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT Kit (QIAGEN). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was amplified using a highly multiplexed tiling PCR reaction based on the Artic Network protocol (https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-bbmuik6w) with some modification. In brief, primers were designed to produce overlapping 1-kb amplicons (Supplementary Table 1). Reverse transcriptase was performed as described in the Artic Network protocol. The single cDNA reaction was carried forward by preparing two PCR reactions (one each for the odd and even pool of primers). Two primer pools (odd and even) were prepared to contain 0.1 μM of each individual primer. Tiling PCR of the resultant cDNA was performed by combining 12.5 μl 2× Q5 polymerase, 5.5 μl water, 2 μl of the primer pool and 5 μl of cDNA followed by incubating the reaction at 98 °C for 30 s, 38 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s and 63 °C for 5 min, and holding at 4 °C. Corresponding odd and even amplicons were normalized and pooled for library preparation. Fragmented libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Analyses were performed using IRMA25 with a SARS-CoV-2 module.

Preparation of viral RNA for NGS was performed as previously described10. In brief, Vero E6 cells were infected with passage-1 viruses. Extraction of total cellular RNA was done using Nucleospin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

RNA from apical washes of human nasal epithelial cells and mouse oropharyngeal swabs were prepared using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturers’ protocols.

To determine the ratios of SARS-CoV-2D614 to SARS-CoV-2G614 in competition assays in human nasal epithelial cell cultures and hACE2 knock-in mice, reverse-transcription PCR was performed on extracted RNA using SuperScript IV One-step RT–PCR System (Invitrogen). The sequence-specific primers were used to generate an amplicon of 905 bp covering the D614 region: 5′-AATCTATCAGGCCGGTAGCAC-3′ and 5′-CAACAGCTATTCCAGTTAAAGCAC-3′. RT–PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl reaction using 0.01 pg to 1 μg total RNA. The cycling parameters were set as follows: 50 °C for 10 min, 98 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. DNA concentration was determined using Qubit dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay (Thermo Fisher), and subsequently diluted to 200 ng in 50 μl of nuclease-free water for sequencing by Nanopore sequencing MinION.

RNA extraction and preparation of RT–PCR reactions were performed in low- and no-copy laboratory environment to avoid contamination.

Sequencing and computational analysis

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2D614 or SARS-CoV-2G614 RNAs of passage-1 stock were sequenced by NGS as previously described10. In brief, RNA was extracted from Vero E6 cells infected with either recombinant SARS-CoV-2D614 or SARS-CoV-2G614 using the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sequencing libraries were subsequently prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, 20020595) and pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced across two lanes on a NovaSeq 6000 S1 flow cell (2 × 50 bp, 100 cycles) using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Next Generation Sequencing Platform of the University of Bern). For data analysis, TrimGalore v.0.6.5 was used to remove low-quality reads and adaptors from the raw sequencing files. The resulting trimmed paired-end reads were then aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank accession MT108784) using Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. Finally, a consensus sequence was generated for each virus stock using Samtools v.1.10 with the -d option set to 10,000. Data analysis was performed on UBELIX, the high-performance computing cluster at the University of Bern (http://www.id.unibe.ch/hpc).

For virus competition experiments in human nasal epithelial cells, hACE2 knock-in mice, hamsters and ferrets, amplicons were sequenced on the MinION system from Oxford Nanopore. Real-time high-accuracy base calling, demultiplexing and barcode and adaptor trimming was performed with MinKnow v.20.06.17, running Guppy v.s4.0.11. Downstream analysis was done in Geneious 2019 v.s2.3. Read length was filtered to eliminate reads <800 and >1,100 nt and the remaining reads were mapped in subsets of 10,000 reads to the amplicon reference undergoing 2 iterations, with custom sensitivity allowing a maximum of 5% gaps and maximum mismatch of 30%. Variants were analysed at specific positions calculating P values for each variant. The ratio fraction A/G was calculated from the numbers of reads, as fraction = A reads/(A reads + G reads).

Statistical analyses for virus competition experiments and relative replicative fitness calculations were performed using the catseyes package in R. Relative replicative fitness values for SARS-CoV-2G614 over SARS-CoV-2D614 were determined by dividing the initial SARS-CoV-2G614/SARS-CoV-2D614 ratio (i 0 ) by the final (after infection) SARS-CoV-2G614/SARS-CoV-2D614 ratio (f 0 ) according to the formula w = (f 0 /i 0 ). Specifically, to model f 0 /i 0 in each experiment, the t 1 /t 0 ratio was calculated on the basis of the sequencing counts attained for each virus in individual samples (after infection, time point t 1 ) and in the inoculum (initial time point t 0 ). For each time point, a linear regression model was generated in R and fitness ratios between the two groups (variants) were assessed by means of the coefficient of the model’s group term. When multiple experiments were performed, the experiment variable was included in the model. All statistical tests were performed in R (v.4.0.2) with two-sided α = 0.05. Cat’s eye plots showing the relative replicative fitness of SARS-CoV-2G614 over SARS-CoV-2D614 for each time point in each experiment were created using the catseyes package in R26, as previously described20.

Animal studies

Ethics declarations

The hACE2 knock-in mice were originally generated at the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health (IACUC protocol no. 09-405) (principal investigator D.E.W.). Mouse experiments were conducted in compliance with the Swiss Animal Welfare legislation, and animal studies were reviewed and approved by the commission for animal experiments of the canton of Bern under licence BE-43/20. All of the ferret and hamster experiments were evaluated by the responsible ethics committee of the State Office of Agriculture, Food Safety, and Fishery in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (LALLF M-V), and gained governmental approval under registration number LVL MV TSD/7221.3-1-041/20. This project also obtained clearance from the Animal Care and Use Program Office of the CDC.

hACE2 knock-in mouse study

For the generation of hACE2 knock-in mice, the hACE2 knock-in (B6) (B6.Cg-Ace2tm1(ACE2)Dwnt/J) line was generated by targeted mutagenesis to express human ACE2 cDNA in place of the mouse Ace2 gene. Thus, in this mouse model, hACE2 expression is regulated by the endogenous mouse Ace2 promoter and enhancer elements. The targeting vector (WEN1-HR) had human ACE2 cDNA inserted in frame with the endogenous initiation codon of the mouse Ace2 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The human cDNA was flanked by an FRT-neomycin-FRT-loxP cassette and a distal loxP site. WEN1-HR was used to transfect 129Sv/Pas embryonic stem cells and 837 embryonic stem cell clones were isolated and screened for homologous recombination by PCR and Southern blot. Eleven properly recombined embryonic stem cell clones were identified, and some of them were used for blastocyst injection and implantation into female mice to generate 22 male founder mice with chimerism (129Sv/Pas:C57BL/6) ranging from 50 to 100%. To complete the hACE2 knock-in, we crossed the chimeric male mice with C57BL/6J Flp-expressing female mice to excise the FRT-flanked neomycin selection cassette and generate the floxed humanized ACE2 allele (Extended Data Fig. 3a). These hACE2 knock-in mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot and were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for seven generations before this study. This line has been donated to The Jackson Laboratory for use by the scientific community (stock 035000).

Heterozygous hACE2 knock-in female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and C57BL/6J wild-type female mice were from Janvier Lab. All mice were acclimatized for at least 2 weeks in individually ventilated cages (blue line, Tecniplast), with 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle, 22 ± 1 °C ambient temperature and 50 ± 5% humidity, autoclaved acidified water, autoclaved cages including food, bedding, and environmental enrichment at the specific-pathogen-free facility of the Institute of Virology and Immunology, (Mittelhäusern). One week before infection, mice were placed in individually HEPA-filtered isolators (IsoCage N, Tecniplast). Mice (10 to 12 weeks old) were anaesthetized with isoflurane and infected intranasally with 20 μl (that is, 10 μl per nostril) with a 1:1 ratio of the SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild-type and hACE2 knock-in mice) or mock culture medium (wild-type mice only). After intranasal infection, mice were monitored daily for body weight loss and clinical signs. Throat swabs were collected daily under brief isoflurane anaesthesia using ultrafine sterile flock swabs (Hydraflock, Puritan, 25-3318-H). The tips of the swabs were placed in 0.5 ml of RA1 lysis buffer (Macherey-Nagel, ref. 740961) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and vortexed. Groups of mice from two independent experiments were euthanized on days 2 and 4 after infection and organs were aseptically dissected, avoiding cross-contamination. Systematic tissue sampling was performed: (1) lung right superior lobe, right nasal concha, right olfactory bulb, part of the right brain hemisphere, apical part of the right kidney and parts of the distal small intestine (ileum) were collected for RNA isolation in RA1 lysis buffer; (2) lung middle, inferior and post-caval lobes, left nasal concha, left olfactory bulb, part of the right brain hemisphere and part of the right kidney were collected in MEM; and (3) lung left lobe, liver left lobe, left kidney, left brain hemisphere and part of the jejunum and ileum were fixed in buffered formalin. Data were generated from two identically designed independent experiments.

Mouse tissue samples collected in RA1 lysis buffer supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol were homogenized using a Bullet Blender Tissue Homogenizer (Next-Advance). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 18,000g and stored at −70 °C until processing. Total RNA was extracted from homogenates using the NucleoMag VET kit for viral and bacterial RNA and DNA from veterinary samples (Macherey Nagel, ref. 744200) and the KingFisher Flex automated extraction instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturers’ instructions. RNA purity was analysed with a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). A 25-μl RT–PCR for the viral E gene was carried out using 5 μl of extracted RNA template using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT–PCR (Applied Biosystems). Samples were processed in duplicate. Amplification and detection were performed in an Applied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR System under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 45 °C for 10 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C and 30 s at 72 °C).

Fixed mouse tissue samples were processed, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin at the COMPATH core facility (University of Bern). Histopathological lung slides of hACE2 knock-in mice and wild-type mice (infected and mock) were examined and scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (S.d.B.), who was blinded to the identity of the samples. Scoring criteria are detailed in Supplementary Table 4.

Hamster study

Six Syrian hamsters (Mesocricretus auratus) (Janvier Labs) were infected intranasally under a short-term inhalation anaesthesia with 70 μl of SARS-CoV-2D614 and SARS-CoV-2G614 at equal ratios using 104.77 TCID 50 per hamster (calculated from back titration of the original material). After 24 h of isolated housing in individually ventilated cages, six pairs (each with one directly inoculated donor hamster and one sham-inoculated contact hamster) were cohoused. The housing of each hamster pair was strictly separated in individual cage systems to prevent spillover between different pairs. For the following seven days (day 2 until day 8 after infection) and on day 12 after infection, viral shedding was monitored in addition to a daily physical examination and body weighing routine.

To evaluate viral shedding, nasal washes were individually collected from each hamster under a short-term isoflurane anaesthesia. Starting with the contact hamster of each pair, each nostril was rinsed with 100 μl PBS (1.0× phosphate-buffered saline) and reflux was immediately gathered. A new pipette tip for every nostril and hamster was used to prevent indirect spillover transmission from one hamster to another. Furthermore, in between the respective pairs, a new anaesthesia system was used for each pair of hamsters. At day 8 after infection, one contact hamster was found dead. Although they lost up to almost 20% of their body weight, every other hamster recovered from disease. Under euthanasia, serum samples were collected from each hamster.

For the single-virus infection experimental setup, seven hamsters each were infected via the intranasal route with 105.1 TCID 50 per hamster of SARS-CoV-2D614, or 104.5 TCID 50 per hamster of SARS-CoV-2G614 (calculated from back titration of the original material). From day 1 to day 4, nasal washes were obtained from these hamsters and body weight changes recorded. A tissue panel from respiratory organs—including nasal conchae, tracheal tissue, cranial, medial and caudal portions of the right lung, and the pulmonary lymph node—were collected after euthanasia from these hamsters.

Ferret study

In accordance with the hamster study, twelve ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) from in-house breeding were divided into six groups of two individuals. Ferret pairs were of equal age (between 4 and 18 months). In total, four ferrets were female (two pairs) and eight ferrets were male or neutered male (four pairs). The housing of each ferret pair was strictly separated in individual cage systems, to prevent spillover between different pairs. Per separate cage, one individual ferret was inoculated intranasally by instillation of 125 μl of the aforementioned inoculum (105.4 TCID 50 per ferret, calculated from back titration of the equally mixed original material) into each nostril under a short-term isoflurane-based inhalation anaesthesia. Time points and sampling technique corresponded to the methods used for the hamsters, although ferret nasal washing was performed using 2× 700 μl PBS per ferret. The contact ferret was not inoculated.

Specimen work up, viral RNA detection, and sequencing and quantification analyses

Organ samples were homogenized in a 1 ml mixture of equal volumes composed of Hank’s balanced salts MEM and Earle’s balanced salts MEM containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 850 mg l−1 NaHCO 3 , 120 mg l−1 sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 300 Hz for 2 min using a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen) and centrifuged to clarify the supernatant. Nucleic acid was extracted from 100 μl of the nasal washes after a short centrifugation step or organ sample supernatant using the NucleoMag Vet kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral loads in these samples were determined using the nCoV_IP4 RT–PCR27 including standard RNA that were absolute-quantified by digital droplet PCR with a sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction. The extracted RNA was afterwards subjected to MinION sequencing and digital droplet PCR. For MinION sequencing, amplicons were produced with primers (WU-21-F: AATCTATCAGGCCGGTAGCAC; WU-86-R: CAACAGCTATTCCAGTTAAAGCAC) using SuperScript IV One-step RT–PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplicons were sequenced on a MinION system from Oxford Nanopore using Native Barcoding 1–12 (EXP-NBD104) and 13–24 (EXP-NBD114), respectively, with Ligation Kit SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore). Libraries were loaded on R9.4.1 Flow Cells (FLO-MIN106D) on a MinION coupled to a MinIT. MinION data analysis was performed as described in ‘Sequencing and computational analysis’.

For rare mutation and sequence analysis based on digital droplet PCR, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System from Bio-Rad was used. The One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad) was applied according to the supplier’s instructions. For the amplification of an 86-bp fragment of both variants of S, the forward primer SARS2-S-1804-F (5′-ACA AAT ACT TCT AAC CAG GTT GC-3′) and the reverse primer SARS2-S-1889-R (5′-GTA AGT TGA TCT GCA TGA ATA GC-3′) were used. For the detection of the D and G variants in one sample, two allele-specific locked nucleic acid probes were applied: SARS2-S-v1D-1834FAM (5′-FAM-TaT cAG gat GTt AAC-BHQ1-3′) and SARS2-S-v3G-1834HEX (5′-HEX-T cAG ggt GTt AAC-BHQ1-3′) (the locked nucleic acid positions are in lowercase). The concentration of the primers and probes was 20 μM and 5 μM, respectively. For data analysis, the QuantaSoft Analysis Pro software (v.1.0.596) was used.

The upload included an image of a journal article from 2008 that used the terms SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV3 (here). The accompanying caption read: “Who can answer this? If SARS-CoV2 is ""novel"" why were they talking about it in 2008? And what's SARS-CoV3? Is that pandemic 2 [Bill] Gates was talking about?”

The study was also referenced on Twitter (here , here and here), with users asking: “Why’s this been kept from public view?” (here).

However, the journal article was unrelated to COVID-19. According to a team of global health scientists and infection preventionists at the Meedan Digital Health Lab, the 2008 study used the terms SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and SARS-CoV3 to refer to gene fragments of SARS-CoV-1, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, shortened to SARS (here).

SARs-CoV-1, which caused the SARS epidemic in 2003 and killed 774 people (here), is different from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019 and was originally named 2019-nCoV (bit.ly/3draQws).

The Meeden scientists explain: “SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, while related, are different viruses and just two of many coronaviruses (named for crown-like spikes on the surfaces) in the RNA virus family of Coronaviridae” (here).

“There has been no virus identified as SARS-CoV-3 as of early 2021”, they add.

Asymptomatic carriers represent a significant risk for transmission. Containment of future outbreaks will depend on early testing in sectors and regions. Higher participation rates must be assured through targeted incentivisation and recurrent invitation.

The voluntary programme covered 49% of the resident and 22% of the cross-border worker populations. It identified 850 index cases with an additional 249 cases from contact tracing. Over-representation was observed in the services, hospitality and construction sectors alongside regional differences. Asymptomatic cases had a significant but lower secondary attack rate when compared to symptomatic individuals. Based on simulations using an agent-based SEIR model, the total number of expected cases would have been 42·9% (90% CI [-0·3, 96·7]) higher without MS. Mandatory participation would have resulted in a further difference of 39·7% [19·6, 59·2].

rRT-PCR-based screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by pooling of samples. The infrastructure allowed the testing of the entire resident and cross-border worker populations. The strategy relied on social connectivity within different activity sectors. Invitation frequencies were tactically increased in sectors and regions with higher prevalence. The results were analysed alongside contact tracing data.

Our study confirms that MS via a pooled rRT-PCR strategy and contact tracing allows the population-wide control of viral transmission. The finding that asymptomatic individuals are similarly infectious as symptomatic patients implies that population-wide containment strategies have to rely on MS to ensure the early breaking of infection chains. Containment of future outbreaks will critically depend on early testing in work sectors and geographical regions. Our analyses, based on the situation and capacities in Luxembourg, imply that a threshold of 150 positive cases per 100,000 per week should trigger the testing of entire groups. Higher participation rates have to be assured through targeted incentivisation and recurrent invitations.

Our study presents the major results and lessons learned of the implemented population-wide screening programme. Rather than perform MS in a single instance, the test strategy was based on social connectivity within activity sectors. This allowed the programme to build up practicable test capacity while ensuring coverage of specific at-risk sectors at high resolution while the general population was screened at lower resolution. The resolution of the screening was dynamically adjusted based on prevalence in the respective sectors and the population. Based on a participation of 49% amongst the resident population and 22% amongst cross-border workers, the MS allowed identification of 1,099 cases corresponding to 26% of positive cases related to an early summer epidemic wave. We show that a population-wide screening programme is able to affect the epidemic dynamics in close coordination with classical contact tracing.

The COVID-19 pandemic imposes unprecedented challenges to governments and public health officials in containing population-wide transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Mass screening (MS) has been suggested as a means to systematically identify positive carriers including asymptomatic individuals. It was for example applied early on in the pandemic in South Korea and recommended on a national level for the United Kingdom. However, the design and implementation of MS programmes imposes significant logistical, methodological and data analysis challenges. Furthermore, recurrent questions over the effectiveness of such programmes have been posed, especially over the role of asymptomatic carriers in triggering and sustaining infection chains. To accompany the progressive lifting of lockdown measures, Luxembourg implemented a MS programme covering its entire population.

Here we provide a detailed description of the mass screening (MS) programme, analyse the results of the first phase (25 th May until 15 th September 2020) including contact tracing information and model the impact of the programme on epidemic dynamics. We show that the population-wide screening programme with a participation rate of 49% among residents was able to contain the epidemic dynamics in close coordination with classical contact tracing. According to our data, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers are to be considered as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Therefore, the success of MS critically depends on broad participation and incentivisation.

The Luxembourg Government imposed stringent lockdown measures in mid-March. The gradual easing of restrictions was accompanied by a population-wide SARS-CoV-2 screening programme aimed at pre-emptive breaking of infection chains. Our approach hinged on social connectivity as the key parameter for the stratification of the population, independent of COVID-19 symptoms, or potential contact with infected carriers. The number of expected social interactions defined the testing frequency per activity sector. This design resulted in ‘adaptable testing’ using differing testing frequencies, which were dynamically adjusted based on prevalence in the respective sectors.

In Spring 2020, it became clear that asymptomatic including presymptomatic carriers could transmit the virus []. Based on the estimated serial interval and incubation period, modelling suggested that up to 44% (25-69%) of transmission occurred just before symptoms appear []. This, together with apparent overdispersion [], drew into question classical pandemic containment strategies. As the population-wide exposure in Luxembourg was estimated to be 2·1% in late April [], large-scale antibody screening would not have been efficient and would not have supported mitigation measures including contact tracing. Furthermore, given the large susceptibility for infection, the acquisition of herd immunity was not considered an option.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented public health crisis with a deep impact on health, social life, and the economy. Governments are devising new strategies to limit the impact of the evolving pandemic on their healthcare systems and societies. In the absence of wide-spread immunity, containment strategies are limited to testing and tracing [].

Representatives of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and the Ministry of Health were involved in the design of this study as well as in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data and in the writing of the article. Both Ministries approved submission of the manuscript for publication.

Phase 1 of Large-Scale Testing was mandated by the Luxembourg Government, represented by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and the Ministry of Health.

To assess the impact of the MS programme on the epidemic dynamics, we developed an agent-based SEIR model similar to Covasim [], tailored to the situation in Luxembourg. The epidemic model was based on detailed information of the social network considering actual household and workplace compositions obtained from the Luxembourg social security system. It also contained a disease module to integrate hospital data. This detailed description allowed for respecting the age distribution of infected people and considering specific activities as well as the resulting infection risks at workplaces. The testing of symptomatic individuals based on prescription, the testing by MS, and the testing of contacts of index cases were separated in the model and fitted to the observations (Suppl. Note 2).

Two logistic regression models were built to identify the determinants associated with participation in MS (Yes, No) and being tested positive (Yes, No). Models were adjusted for the following variables: gender (Male, Female), 10-year age categories, country of residence (Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Germany, Other), disposable income categories (<30k€/year, 30-60k€/year, 60-90k€/year, ≥90k€/year), number of total invitations to participate in MS (for the model on participation only), medication use in the past 6 months to treat a chronic condition (Yes, No), and risk population (high-risk, medium risk, general). We computed secondary attack rates (SAR) in three different ways: overall (SAR), in the household (SAR H ) and for close contacts (SAR CC ), both for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. The SAR was defined as the number of contacts who became positive divided by the number of total contacts. SAR H was defined as the number of contacts who became positive divided by the number of contacts who live in the same place as the positive index case. SAR CC was defined as the number of close contacts who became positive divided by the number of close contacts who were placed in quarantine (the contact had a high-risk interaction with the COVID-19 positive case). For all SAR calculations, the new cases were considered positive contacts if they became positive within five days after the last date of contact with an index case.

The COVID-19 surveillance data was linked to the national database managed by General Inspectorate of Social Security using the national identification number. The personal data were available only to the contact tracing team and were transmitted in aggregated, pseudonymised form to the authors.

Asymptomatic individuals are those that did not report symptoms at the time of the notification of the positive test result. Thereby, the “asymptomatic” group included individuals who were either presymptomatic or truly asymptomatic. Similarly, symptomatic individuals may have been asymptomatic at the time of sampling, particularly presymptomatic carriers who subsequently developed symptoms.

All confirmed positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected by rRT-PCR were reported on a mandatory basis by the clinical laboratory and were automatically included in the centralised contact tracing management system of the Health Directorate (Ministry of Health, Luxembourg). Once a new positive result was transmitted via secure electronic reporting to the Health Directorate, the index case was contacted by phone typically on the same day. A health questionnaire including typical COVID-19 symptoms (headaches, myalgia, fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, loss of smell, diarrhea, etc.) was completed. Positive cases were instructed to self-isolate immediately and avoid contact with other household members. All high-risk contacts which occurred within 48 hours before symptom onset (or before the date of test if asymptomatic) were ordered to self-quarantine. A contact was considered high-risk if there was physical contact or proximity (< 2 meters) to a case for at least 15 minutes without wearing a mask. For each quarantined contact, a laboratory test was automatically prescribed on the 5 th day after the date of last contact. If the test was negative, the quarantine ended automatically on the 8 th day and was followed by 7 days of self-surveillance. If the test was positive, the person was contacted again as a new positive case thereby starting the contact tracing procedure anew. If the contact did not take a test before the 7 th day, the period of quarantine was automatically extended by 7 days to a total of 14 days.

To save time and costs, an implemented pooling strategy involved mixing the samples from 4 different individuals prior to RNA extraction and re-analysing samples from a positive pool individually a second time []. Pool size selection for a one-stage pooling strategy was driven by identifying a suitable trade-off between estimated prevalence in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, analytical sensitivity and specificity (both 100% according to the rRT-PCR kit's manufacturer) as well as technical and practical constraints. Given the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers at 0·3% at the time of implementation and allowing an increase of prevalence to 10% [], the optimal pool size was determined as four []. The pooling strategy presented 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared with individual sample processing (deconvoluted RNA extraction and rRT-PCR testing; Suppl. Note 1). Thus, any uncertainty that may arise from false positives or false negatives was not accounted for in the data analysis.

To facilitate the sampling of the entire Luxembourg resident population along with cross-border workers, a pre-analytic workflow with 17 drive- or walk-through sampling stations was established. The analytical capacity reached up to 20,000 tests/day with a turnover of two working days.

The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic touched Luxembourg over the months of March and April 2020, followed by a relatively low number of positive cases from end of April onwards, when lockdown measures were gradually lifted ( Fig. 1 ). A second wave started in late June. Although a plateau in the number of positive cases was reached in August, there was another increase in the middle of September when the school vacation period ended ( Fig. 1 ). The first phase of the MS programme ran from 25May until 15September 2020 (herein contact tracing data was considered until 24September). This period coincided with the second epidemic wave.

The synergistic effect of MS and contact tracing was studied by switching off tracing for index cases identified by MS. According to our simulations ( Table 2 ), the impact of mass screening may be reduced by more than half without contact tracing (27·3% [-2·0,77·2] increase in total cases when no contact tracing would have been performed for MS index cases).

We observed that not performing the sector-specific screening moderately increased the amplitude of active cases by 7·2% and the number of total cases by 7·9%. The regional targeting of the high-prevalence communes in the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette during the weeks of 27July to 7August increased the number of identified cases by MS by 13·9% [3·4,23·2] in the canton (corresponding to 7·1% [-3·6,17·1] on the country level). Without these additional tests, there would have been only a modest increase in total cases (+1·8%) within the whole country and a 7·9% [-18·5,42·5] increase in the targeted canton during the period from 27July to 15September. Simulations of different starting dates and test numbers for the regional targeting ( Fig. 6 D) reveal that the effect could have been nearly three times greater, had the regional targeting started four weeks earlier.

To assess the impact of MS on the epidemic dynamics, we used an agent-based SEIR model tailored to the situation in Luxembourg in terms of implemented measures and detected cases identified by classical prescription, MS and contact tracing ( Fig. 6 A). Based on the calibrated model, the effect of the MS was quantified [] by comparing the projected number of active cases for the actual development scenario with 566,320 MS tests performed during the period from 1June until 15September to a scenario without any MS and to a setting in which all the 1,436,000 invitations would have been complied with ( Fig. 6 B). The analysis of the amplitude of active cases highlights that, without the implemented MS, the peak of active cases would have increased by 29·0% and that full participation would have led to a further reduction of 29·4% ( Table 2 ). This positive effect of MS is also highlighted by the number of total cases ( Fig. 6 C) which would have been 42·9% higher without the implemented test strategy and full participation would have led to a further reduction of 39·7% ( Table 2 ).

Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, the impact of test and trace interventions, and the risk of occurrence of a second COVID-19 epidemic wave in the UK: a modelling study.

Based on the population-based monitoring, increases in prevalence were observed in the south-west communes belonging to the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette starting in mid-July ( Fig. 5 ). Between the 1July and the 20July, the prevalence in the canton was 327·1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants compared to a mean prevalence of 108·6 cases per 100,000 in all other cantons (IRR 3·01, 95% CI [2·98,3·05], p<0·00001). Based on the observation that the majority of transmissions was occurring in households, each household in the high-prevalence communes of the Esch-sur-Alzette canton received an invitation over one week starting on 27July (36,197 unique invitations with the exception of households already invited as part of targeted sectors such as services and hospitality).

Sector- and region-specific prevalences were monitored in accordance with the programme design. At the end of April-beginning of May, specific working sectors received invitations as part of the gradual reopening. As it was the first to be reopened, the entire construction sector was invited on 25May. However, the higher number of tests did not result in higher number of positive cases in that sector ( Fig. 4 ). During the subsequent epidemic wave, the prevalence in the construction sector was significantly higher than in the other sectors (as an increase of 6·6%, or 1,390 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the entire period versus 5·7%, or 698 per 100,000 on average, in other sectors; this corresponds to an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1·99, (95% CI [1·94,2], p < 0·00001)). The peak in prevalence was reached on 24July with 87·7 infected individuals in the construction sector per 100,000 inhabitants. Consequently, this sector was again invited for testing. The number of tests increased and showed two more peaks during the weeks starting 27July and 24August, the latter corresponding to the end of the collective holidays in this sector. However, by late August, the second epidemic wave had peaked, which is reflected in the declining numbers of positive cases identified in the construction sector ( Fig. 4 , Suppl. Figure 6). The services and hospitality sectors also received additional, targeted invitations based on increases in prevalence (Suppl. Note 6).

Over the course of the testing of the high- and medium-risk sectors, the prevalence was not evenly distributed according to the assumed risk and period covered (Suppl. Note 4, Suppl. Table 2, Suppl. Figure 3, Suppl. Figure 4). For instance, enrichment in positive cases was observed in the services sector (classified among the general population; 11·4% increase over the mean prevalence), hospitality (high-risk; 8·6%) and the construction sector (medium-risk; 6·6%). Moreover, we observed regional differences (33·7% for the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette versus 21·1% for Luxembourg). In addition, the prevalence for individuals from different income categories was not evenly distributed (Suppl. Note 5, Suppl. Figure 5).

With regards to factors associated with being tested positive (Suppl. Table 1), we observed no difference in relation to sex (OR 0·92 [0·76-1·09] for women compared to men). People who worked in the medium- and high-risk sectors had greater odds for being tested positive (OR 1·41 [1·12-1·78] and 2·24 [1·77-2·85], respectively). Individuals with a disposable household income of less than 30k€/year had the highest odds of being tested positive (OR 1·87 [1·53-2·28] when compared to people with 30k€-60k€/year). When compared to people between 30-39 years old, age groups of 20-29 (OR 1·93 [1·39-2·68]), 40-49 (OR 1·77 [1·27-2·46]) and 50-59 (OR 1·46 [1·03-2·08]) had greater odds of being tested positive, whereas no difference was observed for people aged 60-69 (OR 0·86 [0·54-1·38]) or 70-79 (OR 0·53 [0·27-1·04]), and lower odds were observed for extreme age groups, such as individuals ≤9 years old (OR 0·35 [0·20-0·61]) or ≥80 years old (OR 0·37 [0·15-0·91]).

Overall, there were more contacts in the “asymptomatic” than in the “symptomatic” group (8·5 vs 8·2, Wilcoxon test p<0·0001). The difference between the date of the positive result for the index case and the date of last contact was higher in the “asymptomatic” group (4·36 days) compared to the other (1·86 days; Wilcoxon test, p<0·0001). A total of 84·6% of the contacts declared by the asymptomatic individuals were high-risk contacts (placed into quarantine). In contrast, 73·8% of the contacts declared by the symptomatic individuals were high-risk contacts (also placed into quarantine; Chi-square test, p<0·0001).

The 850 index cases resulted in 7,909 contacts. After the removal of redundancy, 6,074 were further considered ( Fig. 3 ). Each index case resulted in an average of 8·3 contacts (range 1-101) and in a mean of 0·7 (SD=1·1) subsequent positive contacts. The positive index cases with no symptoms infected slightly fewer contacts than the symptomatic individuals (Wilcoxon test, p<0·0001) whereby 0·6 (SD=1) and 0·7 (SD=1·1) positive contacts resulted per index case with contacts from asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Thereby, cases which were asymptomatic on the day of the positive result overall had a significant but lower secondary attack rate compared to those who were symptomatic (SAR=0·02 (SD=0·09) versus SAR=0·04 (SD=0·12), p<0·0001). This was reflected in households (SAR=0·05 (SD=0·18) versus SAR=0·10 (SD=0·24), p<0·0001) as well as for close contacts (SAR=0·02 (SD=0·11) versus SAR=0·05 (SD=0·16), p<0·0001). Infections were mostly linked to travel to a foreign country (31·4%), the household setting (23·2%), or the work environment (20%).

The MS uncovered 850 index cases with an additional 249 cases resulting from contact tracing ( Table 1 ). This corresponds to 26% of positive cases related to the epidemic wave. Among the index cases, 567 (67%) reported symptoms at the time of being informed of their positive test result (these may have been presymptomatic at the time of the test), whereas 283 (33%) were asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases were slightly older (mean=36·8 years) than asymptomatic individuals (34·2 years, Wilcoxon test p<0·0001). Around 53% of all cases were diagnosed in men. rRT-PCR Cq-values were higher in asymptomatic cases (mean Cq=30·2) compared to symptomatic cases (mean Cq=28·9, Wilcoxon test p<0·0001).

The initial sets of invitations were sent out between 25 th May and 27 th July. The strategy critically depended on participation upon invitation, as the system was entirely based on a voluntary basis. Invitations to residents and cross-border workers were sent out by postal mail (Suppl. Figure 1). Addressees were able to make an appointment via an online portal or by telephone, at one of the 17 test stations strategically distributed around the country. Compliance was very high, as 95% of the individuals who made an appointment were tested. Among the residents, 307,751, i.e. 49% of the population, took part in the MS, whereas among the cross-border workers, participation was 22·5% (87,198 individuals). A total of 566,320 tests was performed based on a total of 1,436,000 invitations, which corresponds to 69·7% of all tests performed between 25 th May and 15 th September and to an overall response rate of 39·4%. Participation in the programme differed markedly based on socio-demographic factors (Suppl. Note 3).

The testing strategy was designed in an intercalated, three-layered approach: on a first level, we used estimates of exposure to disease and physical proximity to categorize activity sectors into high and medium risk []. Workers in high-risk sectors were invited every two weeks, resulting in high-frequency testing ( Fig. 2 A). On a second level, workers and other members of the population in medium-risk sectors were monitored at medium testing frequency by inviting one out of five per week such that individuals in medium-risk sectors were at least invited once ( Fig. 2 B). Similarly, one in every ten Luxembourg residents in other sectors or the general population was invited at low testing frequency each week to cover an even geographical distribution ( Fig. 2 C). Consequently, a set of representative cross-sectional cohorts were established. These population- and sector-based tracking cohorts proved essential for the early detection of sector- or region-specific infection clusters. On a third level, we reserved sufficient capacity for tactical targeting of specific population groups that revealed increased prevalences in the level two monitoring approach. If the prevalence in the sector-specific tracking cohorts exceeded 10%, the entire sector was tested; equally, adult members of every household in geographical areas with increased infection rates were invited. In this way, the testing frequencies were dynamically adjusted to maximize the use of available resources without compromising the efficiency of outbreak prevention ( Fig. 2 C). The established capacity allowed for a maximum test capacity of 10% of residents and cross-border workers per week.

The frequencies of invitations resulted in (A) high-frequency testing for high-risk sectors and (B) medium-frequency testing for medium-risk sectors. (C) The prevalence in the population was monitored at low testing frequency and targeted invitations were sent in the case of regional flare-ups.

Havlir DV. Asymptomatic transmission, the Achilles’ heel of current strategies to control Covid-19. Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 has been a topic of intense political and societal debate, the rationale for screening asymptomatic individuals having in particular been questioned. In May 2020, the possibility of transmission from asymptomatic carriers was recognised as a possible driver of the pandemic []. Appropriate measures, such as MS of presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, at least in high-risk communities, were recommended []. Nevertheless, whether asymptomatic carriers play an important role in population-based transmission has remained an essential question. The MS programme implemented in Luxembourg, which coincided with a second epidemic wave, thereby provides a unique test case for assessing the role of asymptomatic carriers and the effectiveness of testing and tracing to break infection chains early on.

et al. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population: the CON-VINCE study. Our data show that asymptomatic carriers infect on average the same number of people as symptomatic individuals. The assessment is robust, as the information of a positive carrier being symptom-free was recorded by the contact tracing team once a person was informed about their positive test result. Based on the incubation time of a mean of 4-5 days and given that the test results were communicated to participants within two working days of sample collection, it is highly likely that a significant fraction of individuals did not exhibit any symptoms at the time of testing []. With the number of asymptomatic carriers estimated to be about four-fold the number of positively tested symptomatic individuals at the end of the first epidemic wave in Luxembourg [], our data therefore implies that asymptomatic including presymptomatic individuals are an important factor in triggering and sustaining infection chains. Our work indicates that, in Luxembourg and during the period of study, asymptomatic individuals had significant SARs, both in households and amongst close contacts, but these were lower compared to those for symptomatic cases. Further dedicated studies need to focus on possible differences in infectivity and linked SAR between these two groups as well as in other transmission contexts. Nevertheless, our results highlight that classical pandemic containment strategies, such as a consequential identification and isolation of symptomatic patients, cannot work efficiently for COVID-19.

We acknowledge that a potential differential recall bias may exist between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases due to the self-reporting of symptoms as well as the fact that the data are generated for public health surveillance purposes (isolation of cases and quarantining of their contacts) and not for research purposes. This potential bias may have partially affected our results. In addition, no data was collected on low-risk contacts (which were not placed into quarantine) and this could have had an effect on overestimating the SAR. Caution needs to therefore be taken to compare these estimates with other studies which might have used different definitions for at-risk individuals. Nevertheless, further analysis on the comparison and timing of symptoms onset alongside the SAR will soon be possible in Luxembourg.

Based on the sector-specific prevalences, the classification into high- and medium-risk sectors proved appropriate for certain sectors (2,384 and 1,022 invitations per positive case for healthcare and social work, and hospitality, respectively) but not for others (2,810 and 9,095 invitations for pharmacists and police, for 0 and 1 positive case, respectively). Medium-risk and sectors belonging to the general population which should be reclassified as high-risk include the construction and services sectors. Although recurrent invitations increased participation, the overall compliance within the high-risk sectors varied from 60·8% of invitations being complied with amongst preschool and primary teachers to 27·5% in the hospitality sector. Given the differing prevalence and participation rates in the different sectors, it is challenging to assess the relationship between test frequency and prevalence with the present dataset. Future dedicated work is needed to assess sector-specific testing frequencies with respect to their impact on prevalence and possible sector-specific mitigation. Nevertheless, in addition to the ability to deploy test capacity to affected work sectors and regions, broader participation and compliance are essential to enhance the effectiveness of MS. This may be achieved through tailored incentivisation.

Jones DL. Wastewater and public health: the potential of wastewater surveillance for monitoring COVID-19. Based on our simulations, without the MS programme, the number of cases would have increased substantially (42·9%, (90% CI [-0·3, 96·7])) during the second epidemic wave. Further increase in testing would have been even more impactful, whereby complete participation would have led to a 39·7% [19·6, 59·2] decrease. The impact analysis is based on simulations and is therefore subject to uncertainties as detailed in Suppl. Note 2. A retrospective analysis of sector- and region-specific prevalences highlights that a threshold of 150 positive cases per 100,000 per week should trigger the testing of entire groups (Suppl. Figure 7). A caveat concerns smaller groups whereby these are more prone to noise and, thus, false alarms may be raised. Tactical testing may also be triggered by other early warning signals based on population-level symptomatology or surveillance of wastewater []. Rapid tactical interventions based on regional prevalence are essential for increasing efficiency."

Serial samples were collected from the patient periodically from the lower respiratory tract (sputum or endotracheal aspirate), upper respiratory tract (throat and nasal swab) and from stool. Nucleic acid extraction was done from 500 μl of sample with a dilution of MS2 bacteriophage to act as an internal control, using the easyMAG platform (Biomerieux) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. All samples were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 with a validated one-step RT–qPCR assay developed in conjunction with the Public Health England Clinical Microbiology22. Amplification reactions were all performed on a Rotorgene PCR instrument. Samples with a C t value of ≤36 were considered to be positive.

Sera from recovered patients in the COVIDx study23 were used for testing of neutralization activity by SARS-CoV-2 mutants.

SARS-CoV-2 serology by multiplex particle-based flow cytometry

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, spike and RBD proteins were covalently coupled to distinct carboxylated bead sets (Luminex) to form a triplex and analysed as previously described24. Specific binding was reported as mean fluorescence intensities.

Whole-blood T cell and innate stimulation assay

Whole blood was diluted 1:5 in RPMI into 96-well F plates (Corning) and activated by single stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (10 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich), lipopolysaccharide (1 μg ml−1, List Biochemicals) or by costimulation with anti-CD3 (MEM57, Abcam, 200 ng ml−1, 1:1,000) and IL-2 (Immunotools, 1,430 U ml−1, 1:1,000) antibodies. Supernatants were taken after 24 h. Levels (pg ml−1) are shown for IFNγ, IL-17, IL-2, TNF, IL-6, IL-1b and IL-10. Cytokines were measured by multiplexed particle-based flow cytometry on a Luminex analyser (Bio-Plex, Bio-Rad) using an R&D Systems custom kit (R&D Systems).

For viral genomic sequencing, total RNA was extracted from samples as described previously25. Samples were sequenced using MinION flow cells v.9.4.1 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the ARTICnetwork v.3 protocol26 and BAM files assembled using the ARTICnetwork assembly pipeline27. A representative set of 10 sequences was selected and also sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Amplicons were diluted to 2 ng μl−1 and 25 μl (50 ng) were used as input for each library preparation reaction. The library preparation used KAPA Hyper Prep kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, amplicons were end-repaired and had A-overhang added; these were then ligated with 15 mM of NEXTflex DNA Barcodes (Bio Scientific). Post-ligation products were cleaned using AMPure beads and eluted in 25 μl. Then, 20 μl was used for library amplification by 5 cycles of PCR. For the negative controls, 1 ng was used for ligation-based library preparation. All libraries were assayed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) to assess fragment size and quantified by qPCR. All libraries were then pooled in equimolar ratios accordingly. Libraries were loaded at 15 nM and spiked in 5% PhiX (Illumina) and sequenced on for MiSeq 500 cycle using a Miseq Nano v.2 with 2 × 250 bp paired-end sequencing. A minimum of ten reads was required for a variant call.

Bioinformatics processes

For long-read sequencing, genomes were assembled with reference-based assembly and a curated bioinformatics pipeline with 20× minimum coverage across the whole genome27. For short-read sequencing, FASTQ files were downloaded, poor-quality reads were identified and removed, and both Illumina and PHiX adapters were removed using TrimGalore v.0.6.628. Trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the National Center for Biotechnology Information SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence MN908947.3 using MiniMap2-2.17 with arguments -ax and sr29. BAM files were then sorted and indexed with Samtools v.1.11 and PCR optical duplicates were removed using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Consensus sequences of nucleic acids with a minimum whole-genome coverage of at least 20× were generated with BCFtools using a 0% majority threshold.

Variant calling

Variant frequencies were validated using custom code as part of the AnCovMulti package (https://github.com/PollockLaboratory/AnCovMulti). The main idea behind this validation was to identify and remove consistent potential amplification errors and mutability near the end of Illumina reads. Furthermore, stringent filtering was applied to remove biased amplification of early laboratory-induced mutations or very low copy variations.

Filtering consisted of requiring exact initiation at a primer within 2 bp of the start of a read, a minimum of 247 bp length read, fewer than four well-separated sites divergent from the reference sequence, a maximum insertion size of three nucleotides, a maximum deletion size of 11 bp, and resolution of conflicting signal from different primers.

Single-genome amplification and sequencing

Viral RNA extracts were reverse-transcribed from each sample to sufficiently capture the diversity of the viral population without introducing resampling bias. SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and gene-specific primers were used for reverse transcription. Template RNA was degraded with RNase H (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All primers used were ‘in-house’ primers designed using the multiple sequence alignment of the patient’s consensus sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing. A partial gene sequence of spike (encoding amino acids 21–800) was amplified as one continuous length of DNA (the spike gene is approximately 1.8 kb) by nested PCR. Terminally diluted cDNA was amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) so that 30% of reactions were positive30. By Poisson statistics, sequences were deemed ≥80% likely to be derived from HIV-1 single genomes. We obtained between 20 and 60 single genomes at each sample time point to achieve 90% confidence of detecting variants present at ≥8% of the viral population in vivo31,32. Partial spike amplicons obtained from terminal-dilution PCR amplification were Sanger-sequenced to form a contiguous sequence using another set of eight in-house primers. Sanger sequencing was provided by Genewiz and manual sequence editing was performed using DNA Dynamo software (Blue Tractor Software).

Phylogenetic analysis

All available full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database (http://gisaid.org/)33 on 16 December 2020. Duplicate and low-quality sequences (>5% nucleocapsid regions) were removed, leaving a dataset of 212,297 sequences with a length of more than 29,000 bp. All sequences were sorted by name and only sequences sequenced with United Kingdom/England identifiers were retained. From this dataset, sequences were deduplicated and, in figures in which background sequences were required, randomly subsampled using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). All sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain MN908947.3, using MAFFT v.7.475 with automatic flavour selection34. Major SARS-CoV-2 clade memberships were assigned to all sequences using both the Nextclade server v.0.9 (https://clades.nextstrain.org/) and Phylogenetic Assignment Of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGOLIN)35.

Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were produced using the above curated dataset using IQ-TREE v.2.1.236. Evolutionary model selection for trees were inferred using ModelFinder37 and trees were estimated using the GTR + F + I model with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates38. All trees were visualized with Figtree v.1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/), rooted on the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence and nodes arranged in descending order. Nodes with bootstraps values of less than 50 were collapsed using an in-house script.

In-depth allele frequency variant calling

The SAMFIRE package v.1.0639 was used to call allele frequency trajectories from BAM file data. Reads were included in this analysis if they had a median PHRED score of at least 30, trimming the ends of reads to achieve this if necessary. Nucleotides were then filtered to have a PHRED score of at least 30; reads with fewer than 30 such reads were discarded. Distances between sequences, accounting for low-frequency variant information, were also obtained using SAMFIRE. The sequence distance metric, described in a previous paper40, combines allele frequencies across the whole genome. Where L is the length of the genome, we define q(t) as a 4 × L element vector describing the frequencies of each of the nucleotides A, C, G, and T at each locus in the viral genome sampled at time t. For any given locus i in the genome, we calculate the change in allele frequencies between the times t 1 and t 2 via a generalization of the Hamming distance

$$d({q}_{i}({t}_{1}),{q}_{i}({t}_{2}))=\frac{1}{2}\sum _{a\in \{{\rm{A}},{\rm{C}},{\rm{G}},{\rm{T}}\}}|{q}_{i}^{a}({t}_{1})-{q}_{i}^{a}({t}_{2})|$$

where the vertical lines indicate the absolute value of the difference. These statistics were then combined across the genome to generate the pairwise sequence distance metric

$$D({\bf{q}}({t}_{1}),{\bf{q}}({t}_{2}))=\sum _{i}d({q}_{i}({t}_{1}),{q}_{i}({t}_{2}))$$

The Mathematica software package was used to conduct a regression analysis of pairwise sequence distances against time, leading to an estimate of a mean rate of within-host sequence evolution. In contrast to the phylogenetic analysis, this approach assumed that the samples collected on days 93 and 95 arose via stochastic emission from a spatially separated subpopulation within the host, leading to a lower inferred rate of viral evolution for the bulk of the viral population.

All variants were indecently validated using custom code as part of the AnCovMulti package (https://github.com/PollockLaboratory/AnCovMulti).

Western blot analysis

Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid preparations and 48 h after transfection the culture supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.45-μm-pore-size filter to remove cellular debris. The filtrate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 120 min to pellet virions. The pelleted virions were lysed in Laemmli reducing buffer (1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), SDS, 100% glycerol, β-mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue). Pelleted virions were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under reducing conditions. This was followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were visualized using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Biorad) using anti-spike S2 (Invitrogen; 1:1,000 dilution) and anti-p24 Gag (NIH AIDS Reagents; 1:1,000 dilution) antibodies.

Recombination detection

All sequences were tested for potential recombination, as this would affect evolutionary estimates. Potential recombination events were explored with nine algorithms (RDP, MaxChi, SisScan, GeneConv, Bootscan, PhylPro, Chimera, LARD and 3SEQ), implemented in RDP5 with default settings41. To corroborate any findings, ClonalFrameML v.1.1242 was also used to infer recombination breakpoints. Neither of the programs found evidence of recombination in our data.

Structural viewing

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System v.2.4.0 (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source/releases) was used to map the location of the four spike mutations of interested onto a previously published SARS-CoV-2 spike structure (PDB: 6ZGE)43.

Testing of convalescent plasma for antibody titres

The anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay used to test convalescent plasma for antibody titres was Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika. This indirect ELISA-based assay uses a recombinant structural spike 1 (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in the human cell line HEK293 for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the D614G pCDNA_SARS-CoV-2_Spike plasmid as previously described44 using the QuikChange Lightening Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies).

Pseudotype virus preparation

Viral vectors were prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells using the Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega). HEK293T cells were transfected with a mixture of 11 μl of Fugene HD, 1 μg of pCDNAΔ19Spike–HA, 1 μg of p8.91 HIV-1 gag–pol expression vector45,46 and 1.5 μg of pCSFLW (expressing the firefly luciferase reporter gene with the HIV-1 packaging signal). Viral supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h after transfection, filtered through 0.45-μm filter and stored at −80 °C. The 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was determined using the Steady-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega).

Standardization of virus input by SYBR-Green-based product-enhanced PCR assay

The reverse transcriptase activity of virus preparations was determined by qPCR using a SYBR-Green-based product-enhanced PCR assay as previously described47. In brief, tenfold dilutions of virus supernatant were lysed in a 1:1 ratio in a 2× lysis solution (made up of 40% glycerol (v/v), 0.25% Triton X-100 (v/v), 100 mM KCl, RNase inhibitor 0.8 U ml−1, Tris HCL 100 mM, buffered to pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature.

Then, 12 μl of each sample lysate was added to 13 μl of a SYBR Green master mix (containing 0.5 μM of MS2 RNA forward and reverse primers, 3.5 pmol ml−1 of MS2 RNA and 0.125 U μl−1 of Ribolock RNase inhibitor and cycled in a QuantStudio. Relative amounts of reverse transcriptase activity were determined as the rate of transcription of bacteriophage MS2 RNA, with absolute reverse transcriptase activity calculated by comparing the relative amounts of reverse transcription to a reverse transcriptase standard of known activity.

Serum/plasma pseudotype neutralization assay

Spike pseudotype assays have been shown to have similar characteristics as neutralization testing using fully infectious wild-type SARS-CoV-28. Virus neutralization assays were performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase48. Pseudotyped virus was incubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated human serum samples or convalescent plasma in duplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus- and cell-only controls were also included. Then, freshly trypsinized HEK293T ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells were added to each well. After 48 h incubation in a 5% CO 2 environment at 37 °C, luminescence was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega).

Monoclonal antibody pseudotype neutralization assay

Virus neutralization assays were performed using HeLa cells stably expressing ACE2 and using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase as previously described49. Pseudotyped virus was incubated with serial dilutions of purified monoclonal antibodies9 in duplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, freshly trypsinized HeLa ACE2-expressing cells were added to each well. After 48 h incubation in a 5% CO 2 environment at 37 °C, luminescence was measured using a Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) and neutralization was calculated relative to virus-only controls. IC 50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism.

Ethics

The study was approved by the East of England–Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (17/EE/0025). Written informed consent was obtained from both the patient and his family. Additional control patients with COVID-19 were enrolled to the NIHR BioResource Centre Cambridge under ethics review board approval (17/EE/0025).

Initially, changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were slow to emerge, due perhaps to the total lack of pre-existing immunity.

Intra-individual variation

A new preprint research paper posted to the bioRxiv* server reports the rapid emergence of variants within an infected individual. The evolution of the virus within an infected host is not excluded by the close similarity between the consensus sequences of single-person SARS-CoV-2, since the number of viral copies is at its peak soon after infection occurs and before the host develops adaptive immunity.

With the peak viral burden comes peak transmissibility, after which specific antibody and cellular responses may select for transmissible variants of the virus.

In the immunocompromised, with prolonged viral shedding, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to change its genomic sequence.

The occurrence of intra-individual variation is significant. One study has found an association between the number of genomic sites showing variation with disease severity at the time of sampling.

Overall, however, most individuals show stable consensus sequences over time, indicating that specific antiviral immune responses can continue to target the replicating viruses until the infection’s course is run.

That is, during the early phase of infection, SARS-CoV-2 has not been found to adapt in any single direction.

The issues with shotgun sequencing

A big issue with such studies is that the standard ‘shotgun’ methods used to sequence the virus from a given sample yield the consensus sample, hiding the multiple sequences found in a single individual due to the diverse viral quasispecies.

While shotgunning rapidly covers the whole length of the large viral genome in hundreds or thousands of samples simultaneously, thus detecting variation within a single individual worldwide, it has its limitations. The use of viral RNA amplification on fragments from multiple genomes, and shotgun sequencing of long regions in the form of multiple smaller fragments, prevents the recognition of genetic linkages and the correction of errors in individual haplotypes.

This means that variations within viral sequences within a single individual are reported only in the form of differences at genome positions that go beyond the normal background variation attributed to amplification and sequencing errors. This could swallow up true variations as well if found at low frequencies.

Overview of HT-SGS data generation and analysis. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) is reverse-transcribed to include an 8-nucleotide unique molecular identifier (UMI; multicolored bar), followed by PCR amplification and Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the 6.1-kilobase region encompassing spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), and membrane (M) protein genes. After quality control and trimming, sequence reads are compiled into bins that share a UMI sequence, and bins with low read counts are removed according to the inflection point of the read count distribution. Presumptive false bins arising from errors in the UMI are then identified and removed by the network adjacency method, followed by further removal of bins with the lowest read counts using a more conservative knee point cutoff. Variant calling is then used to identify presumptive erroneous mutations based on rarity and pattern (ex., single-base insertions adjacent to homopolymers), and these are reverted to the sample consensus. Finally, SGS that correspond to haplotypes occurring only once in each sample are excluded (not pictured). (B) To validate data generation and analysis procedures, clonal RNAs transcribed in vitro from USA/WA-1 and double mutant sequences were mixed at varying ratios and subjected to HT-SGS.

Changing the method around

The current study used a single-genome amplification and sequencing (SGS) approach to capture genetic variation within a single sample from an infected individual. The researchers introduced a high-throughput strategy (HT-SGS) whereby the surface protein gene region is subject to deep sequencing of long reads from large numbers of individual virus genomes.

Limited variation in host

The results show how SARS-CoV-2 gene variants emerged under selection pressure from host immune responses during the acute infection phase.

First, the investigators found extensive variations in the strains cultured in vitro, as a result of viral adaptation to the cultured cells, but only seven mutations found in the intra-individual variant haplotypes.

Among the seven participants in the study, the researchers found only one virus haplotype in 3 of them and 2-3 in the rest. The seven mutations were not found to form a structural signature that could be called an intra-individual variant haplotype.

Of these seven single nucleotide variants (SNVs), one SNV was found in the downstream of the spike gene, four in non-structural open reading frames (ORF) 3 and ORF6, and two synonymous SNVs. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from these seven individuals were relatively homogeneous compared to those from the cultured virus.

This appeared to mirror the slow emergence of genetic variations in the virus during the early part of the pandemic.

Selection for neutralization epitope

However, when spike-antibody binding was analyzed in a single individual over time, they found that the total serum binding to the spike protein increased six-fold over days 12-16. Specific antibody binding was found at the N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 subunit.

The binding response widened in range over days 16-19, not being inhibited by any of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. This suggested that the genetically homogeneous samples of the cross-sectional phase of this study came from a period before circulating antibody responses to the viral spike protein had reached their peak.

The viral RNA burden showed a marked, though not steady, decline between days 9 and 17 in two phases. The first decline occurred over four orders of magnitude, between days 9 and 13, but then increased on day 15. It then fell again on day 17.

Interestingly, four minor haplotype variants emerged on day 15. All together carried three separate non-synonymous mutations affecting the same NTD epitope.

This site is neutralized by 4A8, and is a site often mutated in chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as in regions with recurrent deletions.

Before and after

Before these mutations emerged, serum antibodies from the same patient were observed to recognize the 4A8 site primarily. This suggests that as anti-spike NTD antibody titers rise in serum, multiple mutations emerge independently to evade the recognition of this site by these antibodies, leading to a slight interruption of viral clearance from the host.

In fact, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 spike variants were selected for mutational immune escape by increasing antibody responses during acute infection. The lack of more variants of the virus genome was thus also potentially due to this factor.

Overlooked trend

This trend may have been overlooked, firstly because new mutations were being identified and followed on a global scale, focusing on cross-sectional studies and not on longitudinal follow-up. Secondly, the RNA obtained from early samples, when the viral RNA is at its peak, is of high quality, which could have led to this period of the infection being over-studied, at the expense of the viral genome later on, after adaptive immunity kicked in.

Thirdly, the current study used a method designed to analyze single virus genomes with multiple error correction layers, thus minimizing artefactual errors while picking up true genomic variations.

“This allowed groups of important virus variants to be detected even though each variant individually accounted for a small proportion of all sequences in each sample.”

Lastly, the patient in question had a history of stem cell transplantation, implying that immunosuppression might have played a role in the emergence of variants due to the higher rate of replication. The patient was not on immunomodulatory medication when diagnosed with COVID-19. However, viral loads were commensurate with those expected from earlier studies in immunocompetent individuals.

Immune response broadens to overcome evasion

Interestingly, the variants that emerged were replaced by wild-type sequences, probably due to the broadening of the immune response, which overcame the 4A8 site evasion. Thus, polyclonal responses appear to limit the viral escape from immunity, as shown by the absence of RBD variants, particularly in indel-intolerant genome regions.

Conversely, the newly emergent UK, South African and Brazil variants show that immune escape does occur. The extent to which viral clearance occurs is possibly linked to COVID-19 severity.

What are the implications?

The researchers concluded that this virus could rapidly adapt its genome to evade neutralizing antibodies, which could lead in part to delayed clearance of the virus during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

“It will be important to examine whether this reflects a “tipping point” in early infection at which SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity can occasionally allow sustained replication through the evasion of immune recognition. Immunity induced by prior infection, vaccination, or passive immunization could reduce the potential for escape by controlling initial levels of virus replication quickly.”

Early antiviral or monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy could thus help overcome the infection much more effectively than treating with a single drug later on in the disease.

In many countries, diagnostic testing to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infections has played an important role in the management of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Mostly using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), tests for active infection have informed measures related to contact tracing, self-isolation, and healthcare management on an individual level.1



Using rRT-PCR tests alone, however, it is difficult to derive accurate population-level insights on true disease burden. Sampling biases, variable testing capacity and multiple other factors can easily limit data interpretation. Also, many COVID-19 infections are mild or subclinical, there are many positive cases which go unnoticed or unreported.2 To determine true infection rates, therefore, supplementary testing approaches are needed. In this article, we explore how seroprevalence studies, also known as serosurveys, provide a means of understanding community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the challenges of interpreting serological results and identifying people who had mild infections.





Antibodies used in COVID-19 serosurveys





What is a COVID-19 serosurvey? In a nutshell, COVID-19 serosurveys examine a large number of blood samples from individuals who do not have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and detect the immune response to the virus – but not the virus itself.

3 Data from serosurveys are used to estimate seroprevalence, i.e., the number of people in a population who test positive for a disease based on serological markers.

Early/current or recent infection : IgM is the first response antibody and becomes undetectable weeks to months following infection. A positive IgM test may be indicative of a more recent infection, although the dynamics of the IgM antibody response are not well defined.

Previous infection : IgG antibodies usually develop within 7 to 10 days after COVID-19 symptom onset and remain in the blood after the infection has passed.

Serology is a branch of medical science that deals with the study of serum, especially in relation to its immunological properties. In practice, serological tests detect specific antibodies in serum or plasma components of blood, such as those against SARS-CoV-2. Antibody production by B lymphocytes is a standard feature of the adaptive immune response, whereby antibodies are produced at varying stages of infection. Antibodies are defined by the type of heavy chain present and are categorized into five classes (and further subclasses) known as isotypes: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE (Figure 1).Not all of these isotypes are measured in serological assays; IgA has a central role in mucosal immunity 4 and little is known about the significance of its dynamics in relation to COVID-19, while the function of IgD in general is poorly understood 5 , and there is no serological evidence for the induction of IgE production in people with COVID-19 (as of December 2020). 4 Most serological assays are based on the measurement of IgG and/or IgM. As discussed below, while antibody tests are an important tool for understanding community transmission, it is important to consider their limitations when interpreting results. In general, IgG and IgM measurements are used to indicate

Across the globe, over 100 serosurveys have been conducted to estimate the true prevalence of infection. Authors claim surveillance can inform disease trends, resource allocation, and effectiveness of community interventions by providing an estimate of the extent of an outbreak and enabling outbreak dynamics to be characterized in greater detail. 6 Theoretically, accurate mapping and tracking allow epidemiologists and public health specialists to take evidence-based action upon the identification of hotspots and at-risk groups, and also see how serosurvey data changes over time within the same group. 7 8 Data from SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates can be stratified by sex, age group, and geographical region to inform 3

Immunologic Testing for COVID-19 Preventive measures, accurate disease diagnostics and effective contact tracing are still considered fundamental in efforts to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Immunologic tests can be performed under common clinical settings and the results are available in a matter of hours, which significantly expedites diagnostic practices.

Challenges in interpreting serological data



“My feeling on data is that it is almost definitely good to have, but the question is, what should we do with it? Serosurveys will continue to be important for providing us a snapshot – but not a full picture – of what is occurring and will need to be interpreted carefully. Big swings upwards will alert us that something might be happening, i.e., that we need to dig deeper to find an outbreak or a micro-outbreak deserving of more intensive track and trace efforts. One needs to keep in mind, however, that by the time that an antibody change is detected, it may be too late to intervene. A more useful approach would be to complex it with data from



molecular wastewater monitoring to provide more real-time information from two sources of data.”

In practice, interpreting and comparing data from serosurveys can be difficult, with studies varying in size, diagnostic test and sampling approach. Also, the lag between data collection and reporting is a major challenge, explains Jill Foster , professor in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology at the University of Minnesota Medical School.As Peeling and Olliaro (2020) highlighted, serology tests must be highly sensitive and specific if they are to inform public health measures and controls, and should be thoroughly assessed to minimize misclassifying people. 7 They also add that estimating the proportion of the population that has been infected is made even more difficult if testing strategies are changed over time. As less costly and invasive tests become available, strategies are indeed highly likely to change. The list of commercially available COVID-19 diagnostic tests continues to grow, as seen in this coronavirus test tracker which documents serological tests to have received regulatory approval across the US, Europe and Asia.There have been reports of patients who have contracted a mild form of COVID-19, yet have not seroconverted. In other words, they do not have detectable amounts of serum IgG. 9 To investigate this apparent lack of seroconversion, Magnus Gisslén , professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Gothenburg, led a study investigating serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection, measured using two commercially available serological assays. The report, now published indescribes the concentration and time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum of patients with severe (n=15) and mild symptoms (n=32) of COVID-19.“The lack of seroconversion in the 10% of patients with mild disease was due to the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial assays,” explains Gisslén. “Using the more sensitive assays, we saw they had indeed developed antibodies, i.e., seroconverted. To avoid the risk of false positives, commercial tests need to be calibrated in such a way that risks false negatives.” By highlighting missed positive cases, the study has major implications for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence studies.In the three patients with mild COVID-19 who did not develop detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detectable. One might ask, why is NAb detection not part of standard commercial tests? Is this a feasible measurement to incorporate in future commercial tests? Not quite, says Gisslén: “The analysis of neutralizing antibodies is highly laborious and uses live virus, which requires the use of special labs. It is therefore not feasible to use NAbs as a clinical routine test. However, antibody tests could be developed to closely match the results that could be obtained from a virus neutralization test. For example, we could measure antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Such commercial tests are becoming increasingly available.”Early in the pandemic, it was thought that antibody tests might serve as the basis for an “ immunity passport ” that would enable individuals to continue with their daily lives, assuming they are protected against reinfection. Without data from thorough, long-term reinfection studies, however, such an assumption cannot be made safely. As a result, this continues to be an area of active research.Interim preprint results from a large-scale, multi-center prospective study of healthcare workers in the UK provide an insight; of 6614 participants who were antibody-positive or had a history of testing PCR/antibody-positive to SARS-CoV-2, 44 reinfections (two probable, 42 possible) were detected within a five-month period. The incidence density per 100,000 person days was 3.3 in the positive cohort, compared with 22.4 in the negative cohort, leading the authors to conclude that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to protect most individuals against reinfection for at least five months. Ongoing studies aim to address how long antibody protection lasts after infection – and will now need to take new virus variants into consideration.As summarized by an editorial board member in the journal, serological tests are not perfect, but they provide much-needed estimates of the fraction of the population with SARS-CoV-2. 3 Their value is heavily influenced by their diagnostic accuracy and the sampling strategy employed, and therefore it is important to take study limitations into consideration when interpreting results. Overall, the path to understanding COVID-19 dynamics might not be straightforward, but it is forcing significant progress in diagnostic developments . Hopefully, this progress will spill over, and benefit the diagnosis and management of other diseases in the future.1. Mallett S, Allen AJ, Graziadio S, et al.

Though it’s well established that the first known infections were discovered in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, investigations have not settled on the intermediary host which transferred the virus from the mostly likely SARS-CoV-2 reservoir—horseshoe bats—to humans.

That information is vital to a myriad of issues still persistent in the pandemic 1 year in—not the least of all being the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 variants currently spreading across the globe.

In this month’s episode of Lungcast, a monthly respiratory health podcast series hosted by the American Lung Association (ALA), Donald Alcendor, PhD, vaccinologist and immunologist from Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, discussed the matter of hunting the zoological intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.

Across numerous pandemic topics, Alcendor and ALA chief medical officer Al Rizzo, MD depicted a scenario of clinical achievements backdropped against tracing and screening shortcomings that have left investigators with major gaps to fill in COVID-19 understanding.

Here’s what Alcendor had to say on the pursuit of SARS-CoV-2 origins.

As he explained, the original belief that a pangolin may have aided in its progression to humans is now moot.

“We know this is a zoological transmission,” Alcendor explained. “We have to understand how this virus is being transmitted in the animals that service reservoirs. And once we do, we need to limit this zoological contact to humans.”

Another option to limiting zoological transmission risk could be vaccinating intermediary host animals, Alcendor said.

“Why not do that?” he asked. “If you are able to identify a zoological host, why don’t you vaccinate the animals—particularly these animals that are needed in the population—from diseases that they can transmit to us?”

SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to propagate in various animal species. The ability to monitor it—by effectively tracing its zoologic origin and with increased genetic testing—would allow investigators to answer vital questions on viral outbreaks: what’s coming next, how soon may it come, and are we prepared to manage it?"

PerkinElmer Diagnostics senior vice-president Masoud Toloue said: “While RT-PCR tests remain the gold standard in Covid-19 diagnostics, there is an unmet need in the market for a highly reliable antigen test that can support the reopening strategies of organisations worldwide.

“Just like with our RT-PCR test, significant talent and effort were put behind developing a lateral flow antigen test that sets the benchmark for rapid testing and may help facilitate the safe return of in-person education, commerce, and everyday life.”

The antigen test is available in more than 30 countries that accept the CE mark.

The company’s portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 testing solutions includes high- throughput RNA extraction, RT-PCR, automation, ELISA, chemiluminescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and lateral flow-based serology testing.

According to the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) comparative data, PerkinElmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit has the lowest detection limit among other authorised Covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests.

Last March, this RT-PCR assay received FDA emergency use authorisation (EUA). It received EUA to test individuals without symptoms last month.

Once SARS-CoV-2 infects someone's body, it becomes covered in that person's unique glycans, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize the virus as something it needs to fight. Those glycans also play an important role in activating the virus. Terra Sztain-Pedone, a graduate student, and colleagues in the labs of Rommie Amaro at the University of California, San Diego and Lillian Chong at the University of Pittsburgh, studied exactly how the glycans activate SARS-CoV-2. Sztain-Pedone will present the research on Thursday, February 25 at the 65th Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society.

For SARS-CoV-2 to become activated and infectious, the spike proteins on the outside of the virus need to change shape so it can stick to our cells. Scientists knew that the glycans that coat these spikes help SARS-CoV-2 evade the immune system, but it was not known what role they played in the activation process. Studying these molecules is tricky because they are so small and have many parts that move in subtle ways. ""There are half a million atoms in just one of these spike protein simulations,"" Sztain-Pedone explained.

Using advanced High Performance Computing algorithms that run many simulations in parallel, the research team examined how the positions of each of those atoms changes as the SARS-CoV-2 spike becomes activated. ""Most computers wouldn't be able to do this with half a million atoms,"" Sztain-Pedone says.

The team was able to identify the glycans and molecules that are responsible for activating the spike protein. ""Surprisingly, one glycan seems to be responsible for initiating the entire opening,"" Sztain-Pedone says. Other glycans are involved in subsequent steps. To validate their findings, the team is currently working with Jason McLellan, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues who are performing experiments with spike proteins in the lab.

There is potential to use the simulations developed by Sztain-Pedone and colleagues to identify treatments that will block or prevent SARS-CoV-2 activation. ""Because we have all these structures, we can do small molecule screening with computational algorithms,"" Sztain-Pedone explained. They can also study new virus mutations, such as the B.1.1.7 variant that is currently spreading, to ""look at how that might affect the spike protein activation,"" Sztain-Pedone says."

When SARS-CoV-2 first began spreading across the globe, not every lab was equipped to study it directly. The virus behind the current pandemic is highly pathogenic and transmissible, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require many of the same biosafety guidelines that shape the study of diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola.

As in many moments throughout the last year, the scientific community responded by creatively adapting existing tools to the study of COVID-19. Among these, researchers turned to models of the pathogen such as pseudoviruses and chimeric viruses that can be studied safely in labs with lower biosafety level (BSL) clearance than required for studying the wildtype version, in an effort to expand the study of the novel coronavirus. Pseudoviruses don’t replicate, rendering them harmless, but by replacing their surface envelope proteins with those of SARS-CoV-2, researchers can glean insights into the ways the pathogen infects cells. A chimeric virus is made by inserting the genetic material of one virus into the genome of another, safe surrogate, and these introduced sequences are passed on when the virus replicates.

In addition to their safety, pseudoviruses are “extremely versatile in that you can . . . introduce different envelope proteins and you can introduce mutations, which is making it extremely useful for us to screen a lot of different variants,” says Carol Weiss, a virologist who heads the laboratory of immunoregulation at the US Food and Drug Administration. “If you want to introduce mutations in real viruses, it’s a whole lot more work.”

An approximation of the real thing

Pseudoviruses were first developed in the 1960s, after scientists began studying a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolated from cattle. In addition to replicating well in culture, they later learned that its surface protein, VSV-G, facilitates entry into all eukaryotic cells, making the virus a useful vector not only as a pseudovirus but as a ferry to deliver DNA into cells for therapeutic purposes. The first Ebola vaccine was developed using a VSV platform, and more recently, the virus has been engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells.

HIV-based platforms, which came about in the 1980s, have since replaced VSV as the most common model for developing both pseudo- and chimeric viruses. Unlike VSV’s negative-strand RNA genome that must be transcribed once inside the cell, HIV’s positive-strand RNA genome can instantly begin translation, making pseudoviruses based on HIV faster to produce. HIV-based model viruses have now been used in many of the same applications as VSV, with scientists applying them to the study of diseases such as AIDS, SARS, MERS, and influenza.

We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2. —Sean Whelan, Washington University

To harness these surrogates to study SARS-CoV-2, researchers first needed to prove that their pseudo- and chimeric viruses are viable stand-ins for the real thing. SARS-CoV-2 is a uniquely bulky virus—its genome is roughly 30 kilobases, while HIV and VSV sit around 10 kilobases—and while it is more similar to HIV, none of the three are closely related. Fortunately, both HIV and VSV appear to be compatible for making coronavirus models.

Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis, is one of many scientists who has developed a viable chimeric virus platform and quantified its performance in the face of antibodies against the real thing. To do this, he developed two complimentary assays—one for use in infectious disease laboratories with the BSL-3 clearance required to handle live SARS-CoV-2 and another for labs working under a lower, BSL-2 clearance—and studied how each virus responded to a battery of different treatments. It wasn’t enough, he says, to test the viruses’ ability to evade just one type of antibody, so he used monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and serum from recovered COVID-19 patients—as well as a type of ACE2 decoy protein suggested as a possible therapeutic to draw the virus away from the cells’ own receptor. “We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2.”

The BSL-2 assay Whelan designed uses a chimeric VSV that includes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and produces a green fluorescent protein as a signal for infection (luciferase is also often used). Whelan exposed human cells to his chimeric virus until 100 cells had been infected. Then, he bathed the cells in each type of antibody and the decoy protein and recorded how quickly and to what extent the chimeric virus was able to escape them.

Simultaneously, Whelan’s colleague Mike Diamond, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine, developed a BSL-3 assay using a live clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to Whelan’s assay, he exposed 100 infected cells to the same litany of tests and used immunostaining to track infected cells over time.

The results, published in Cell Host and Microbe in September, demonstrate that the two assays produce neutralization profiles for each exposure that align 93 percent of the time, meaning that the chimeric virus is a suitable proxy for assessing the ability of antibodies to shut down SARS-CoV-2. Many papers have published similar results, comparing their assays against wildtype coronavirus. This validation against the true virus is important, Whelan says, because a chimeric virus “looks like COVID from the outside, but it’s not COVID on the inside.”

A speedy means for tracking emerging variants

While studies involving true isolates of SARS-CoV-2 will always be the gold standard for understanding the complex dynamics of COVID-19, there are instances in which pseudo- and chimeric viruses are better choices. For one, such models are inherently more genetically stable than their wildtype counterparts. Viruses change a bit each time they interact with a new host, and individual copies within a single person might not be identical. In the lab, viruses can also evolve new mutations in response to the types of cells used to culture them. Viruses propagated in monkey cells, for example, may adopt different mutations than those cultured in human cells.

One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory. —Carol Weiss, US Food and Drug Administration

When scientists engineer proxies of SARS-CoV-2, they can control for some of that variation by using plasmids that all contain a single clone of the spike protein. “One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory,” the FDA’s Weiss tells The Scientist. “It’s not a mixture of mutations. We know exactly what we’re testing.”

In some instances, researchers specifically want to study new mutations to, say, see how they might change the efficacy of vaccines. Already, notable variants have emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil that dampen the effectiveness of some vaccines. South Africa recently halted the rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after it produced only a weak response against mild and moderate illness, and Moderna announced plans to modify the second iteration of its vaccine in an effort to remain robust against these new variants. For studying such mutations in the spike protein, pseudoviruses offer a much faster model for generating and testing new versions than the actual virus does.

See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”

Rather than having to clone each new variant as it emerges in wildtype specimens to assess whether a vaccinated individual’s antibodies will be effective, pseudoviruses allow scientists to quickly create new models with the same mutations to run their experiments. Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University, says that she routinely screens as many as 1,000 pseudovirus samples within 48 hours to determine whether any are a cause for concern, a process that would take much longer were she waiting for live clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the same mutations. With pseudoviruses, “you are able to test a lot more samples much faster with the appropriate replicates.”

Hatziioannou’s team recently tested the blood of 20 patients who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and identified individuals who mounted a robust antibody response to the virus. They extracted and isolated 18 unique antibodies associated with the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) and exposed a VSV-based chimeric virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike to each antibody type individually to see which mutations are selects for as the virus replicates.

Next, they engineered HIV-based pseudoviruses with each unique spike mutation that resulted from the VSV experiments and used their own neutralization assay to determine whether the mutations conferred resistance to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. To confirm that the virus would behave the same when exposed to a cocktail of many different antibodies, as in a human body, the researchers also pitted the pseudoviruses against plasma taken from recovered patients.

Their results, shared on the preprint server bioRxiv on January 19 and recently accepted in Nature, demonstrate that many mutations do decrease the ability of neutralizing antibodies to effectively combat the virus. “In all cases, the mutations identified by the VSV [chimeric virus] were mutations that conferred resistance in the HIV pseudotype,” Hatziioannou says, although she adds that vaccines are still an important tool. When they looked specifically at mutations found in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants, first identified in South Africa and the UK, respectively, they found that the neutralizing ability “was a bit weaker than a virus without these substitutions, but the effects were overall small.”

Where pseudo- and chimeric viruses fall short

While these surrogate platforms have been useful tools for studying how SARS-CoV-2 enters our cells, there will always be a need for BSL-3 labs that can study the virus directly. “The disadvantage of using pseudotypes is that the only biological property that you’re really going to learn about coronaviruses is those properties that relate to the spike protein,” Vicente Planelles, a pathologist at the University of Utah, tells The Scientist. “As soon as we go beyond the processes that the spike is responsible for, we need a different model.”

No pseudovirus platform can fully recapitulate how the virus propagates and releases new copies of itself, for example, nor can scientists use them to study other mechanisms by which the virus circumvents the body’s immune system.

In addition, while pseudoviruses are useful for assessing the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapies, they are less helpful with respect to evaluating other drugs that treat the severity of the disease. Remdesivir, for example, was highlighted as a promising option early in the pandemic before conflicting evidence cast its effectiveness into doubt. But the family of drugs to which remdesivir belongs, called nucleoside analogs, could prove useful in preventing extreme illness if scientists could find a better candidate. These drugs work by interfering with a virus’s ability to replicate, which pseudoviruses do not do. “If we found nucleoside analogs that work better than remdesivir, we would be in great shape,” Planelles says. “But you cannot probe that with a pseudovirus, because the gene [that the drug targets] is an internal gene that is not the spike.”"

A vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed for older adults, in whom morbidity and mortality due to the disease are increased. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in adults aged 60 years and older.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy adults aged 60 years and older in Renqiu (Hebei, China). Vaccine or placebo was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (days 0 and 28). Phase 1 comprised a dose-escalation study, in which participants were allocated to two blocks: block 1 (3 μg inactivated virus in 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide solution per injection) and block 2 (6 μg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo (aluminium hydroxide solution only). In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) using block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 μg, 3 μg, or 6 μg per dose, or placebo. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was seroconversion rate at 28 days after the second injection (which was assessed in all participants who had received the two doses of vaccine according to their random assignment, had antibody results available, and did not violate the trial protocol). Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative at baseline to seropositive for neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 (positive cutoff titre 1/8), or a four-fold titre increase if the participant was seropositive at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04383574 ).

Findings

Between May 22 and June 1, 2020, 72 participants (24 in each intervention group and 24 in the placebo group; mean age 65·8 years [SD 4·8]) were enrolled in phase 1, and between June 12 and June 15, 2020, 350 participants were enrolled in phase 2 (100 in each intervention group and 50 in the placebo group; mean age 66·6 years [SD 4·7] in 349 participants). In the safety populations from both phases, any adverse reaction within 28 days after injection occurred in 20 (20%) of 100 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 25 (20%) of 125 in the 3 μg group, 27 (22%) of 123 in the 6 μg group, and 15 (21%) of 73 in the placebo group. All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity and injection site pain (39 [9%] of 421 participants) was the most frequently reported event. As of Aug 28, 2020, eight serious adverse events, considered unrelated to vaccination, have been reported by seven (2%) participants. In phase 1, seroconversion after the second dose was observed in 24 of 24 participants (100·0% [95% CI 85·8–100·0]) in the 3 μg group and 22 of 23 (95·7% [78·1–99·9]) in the 6 μg group. In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 88 of 97 participants in the 1·5 μg group (90·7% [83·1–95·7]), 96 of 98 in the 3 μg group (98·0% [92·8–99·8]), and 97 of 98 (99·0% [94·5–100·0]) in the 6 μg group. There were no detectable antibody responses in the placebo groups.

Interpretation

CoronaVac is safe and well tolerated in older adults. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3 μg dose were similar to those of the 6 μg dose, and higher than those of the 1·5 μg dose, supporting the use of the 3 μg dose CoronaVac in phase 3 trials to assess protection against COVID-19.

The study, published in The Lancet Microbe, shows that the severity of the infection could be a deciding factor in having longer-lasting antibodies. Individuals with low levels of neutralising antibodies may still be protected from COVID-19 if they have a robust T-cell immunity.

""The key message from this study is that the longevity of functional neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can vary greatly and it is important to monitor this at an individual level. This work may have implications for immunity longevity after vaccination, which will be part of our follow-up studies,"" said Professor Wang Linfa, from Duke-NUS' Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Programme, a corresponding author of the study.

The team was able to categorise people into five groups depending on how long their antibodies lasted. The first group, who never developed detectable neutralising antibodies also called the 'negative' group, comprised 11.6 per cent of the patients in the study. The 'rapid waning' group (26.8 per cent) had varying early levels of antibodies that waned quickly. The 'slow waning' group (29 per cent) tested mostly positive for antibodies at six months. The 'persistent' group (31.7 per cent) showed little change in their antibody levels up to 180 days and, finally, the 'delayed response' group (1.8 per cent) showed a marked rise in neutralising antibodies during late convalescence.

While this study focused on determining the levels of neutralising antibodies, which are part of the body's comprehensive immune defence system, the other important aspect of an effective immune defence is T-cell immunity. The study found that the patients tested, including those from the 'negative group', displayed sustained T-cell immunity six months after initial infection. This shows that individuals may still be protected if they have a robust T-cell immunity when the neutralising antibody level is low.

""Our study examines neutralising antibodies which are important in protection from COVID-19. We found that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wane in different people at different rates. This emphasises the importance of public health and social measures in ongoing pandemic outbreak response. However, the presence of T-cell immunity provides hope of longer-term protection which will require more studies and time for epidemiological and clinical evidence to confirm,"" said Associate Professor David Lye, Director, Infectious Disease Research and Training Office, NCID, also a corresponding author of the study.

""This study reminds us that we all react differently to infection and that various people mount different protective immune responses. Understanding the basis of these differences will help build better vaccines,"" added Professor Laurent Renia, Executive Director, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs.

The findings are important as policy makers design vaccination programmes and pandemic exit strategies. The rate of antibody waning suggests re-infection may occur in subsequent waves of infection. Also, if immunity provided via vaccinations wanes like naturally-produced antibodies, then annual vaccine administration could be necessary to prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19. Further research will be needed to clarify this as vaccine programmes are rolled out.

Alina Chan, a postdoctoral fellow specializing in gene therapy and cell engineering at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, echoes that view. Chan says the risk of challenging the orthodoxy that SARS-CoV-2 has natural origins—an entirely plausible hypothesis, she maintains—is greatest for established scientists in infectious disease with supervisory roles and staffs to support. She herself has spent much of the last year calling for more scrutiny of a potential lab leak, claiming that as a postdoc, she has less to lose.

The vitriol also obscures a broader imperative, Relman says, which is that uncovering the virus’s origins is crucial to stopping the next pandemic. Threats from both lab accidents and natural spillovers are growing simultaneously as humans move steadily into wild places and new biosafety labs grow in number around the world. “This is why the origins question is so important,” Relman says.

“We need a much better sense about where to place our resources and effort,” he adds. And if a lab release for SARS-CoV-2 looks plausible, Relman says, “then it absolutely deserves a whole lot more attention.”

If SARS-CoV-2 did spill over into humans from the wild, how and where did that happen? A year into the pandemic, these remain open questions. Scientists still speculate about whether the virus passed directly into humans from infected bats (known reservoirs for hundreds of different coronaviruses) or through an intermediary animal species. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was initially thought to be the originating site of a potential spillover, since that's where the first cluster of covid-19—the disease caused by the virus—was detected. But newer evidence suggests that animal or human infections may have been circulating elsewhere for months beforehand, and the focus has since broadened to other markets in the city, wildlife farms in southern China, and other possible scenarios, such as consuming virally contaminated frozen meat originating in other provinces.

Importantly, the virus’s immediate ancestors have yet to be identified. The closest known relative, a coronavirus dubbed RaTG13, is genetically 96% similar to SARS-CoV-2.

A lab-escaped virus, meanwhile, would have been introduced to the world by a researcher or technician who became infected with it. These sorts of lab leaks have happened before, and were implicated in several cases of community transmission during SARS outbreaks in the early 2000s. In 2017, the Wuhan Institute of Virology became the first lab in mainland China to receive a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) designation, the highest security status for a research space. But the institute also has a history of questionable safety practices. The lab’s scientists reported a lack of appropriately trained technicians and investigators at the facility, prompting US diplomatic scientists who visited in 2017 and 2018 to alert the State Department. At the same time, many scientists have pointed out, particularly in the aftermath of a recent, and for some, contentious, examination of the lab-leak hypothesis in New York magazine, that coronaviruses have typically been handled at BSL-2 or BSL-3—lower security levels.

Such caveats aside, a prevailing theory among lab-leak proponents has been that SARS-CoV-2 was not simply brought into the Wuhan lab but was somehow engineered there, given that many of its scientists routinely perform genetic research on coronaviruses and may also have “collaborated on publications and secret projects with China’s military,” according to a US State Department fact sheet released during the last week of the Trump administration. On March 9, a Washington Post columnist, citing an unnamed State Department official, suggested that the Biden administration—while stopping well short of endorsing any particular theory regarding the origin of the virus—did not dispute many of the points made in that fact sheet.

Still, skeptics who doubt the lab-leak hypothesis say SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t look anything like an engineered virus. Instead of appearing in discrete chunks, as would be expected with a genetically engineered microbe, the differences with RaTg13 are distributed randomly throughout the viral genome. In an email to Undark, University of Chicago emeritus virology professor Bernard Roizman wrote that “we are many, many years away from a complete understanding of viral gene functions and regulation—the key elements critical for construction of lethal viruses.”

The virus does have an inexplicable feature: a so-called “furin cleavage site” in the spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 pry its way into human cells. While such sites are present in some coronaviruses, they haven’t been found in any of SARS-CoV-2’s closest known relatives. “We don’t know where the furin site came from,” says Susan Weiss, a microbiologist who co-directs the Penn Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. “It’s a mystery.” Although Weiss says SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have been engineered, she adds that the possibility that it escaped from a lab can’t be ruled out.

Stanford microbiologist David Relman believes the lab-leak hypothesis was never given a fair hearing. ALBERTO E. RODRIGUEZ/GETTY IMAGES

Relman says it’s also possible that scientists working with undisclosed and even more closely related coronaviruses—perhaps one with a furin cleavage site and another with the SARS-CoV-2 gene backbone—may have been tempted to create a recombinant virus so they could study its properties. Indeed, researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology initially failed to disclose that eight other SARS-like coronaviruses had been detected in samples collected from the same mine cave where RaTG13 was found. Workers who cleaned bat feces in that cave, located in Yunnan Province near the border with Laos, went on to develop severe respiratory disease, and at least one of them—and, perhaps more—died.

Petrovsky leans towards another potential scenario, namely that SARS-CoV-2 might be evolved from coronaviruses that snuck into lab cultures. Related viruses in the same culture, he explains, such as one optimized for human ACE2 binding and another not, can swap genetic material to create new strains. “We’ve had this sort of thing happen in our own lab,” he says. “One day, you’re culturing flu, and then one day you sequence it, and you go, ‘Holy shit, where did this other virus come from in our culture?’ Viruses are evolving the whole time, and it’s easy for a virus to get into your culture without you knowing it.” Petrovsky and several coauthors speculated in a paper published as a non-peer-reviewed preprint in May of last year as to whether the virus was “completely natural” or whether it originated with “a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or intentionally in a laboratory handling coronaviruses.” The team wasn’t “saying this is a lab virus,” Petrovsky emphasizes, but rather “just presenting our data.”

But in late April 2020, as Petrovsky’s group was thinking about where to publish their work, “Trump blurted out” that he had reason to believe the virus came out of a Chinese lab, Petrovsky says. And at that point, he adds, much of “the left-wing media” decided “they were going to paint the whole lab thing as a conspiracy theory to bring down Trump.” When Petrovsky approached administrators of the preprint server bioRxiv, the paper was refused. BioRxiv staff replied that it would be more appropriately distributed after peer review, “which stunned us,” Petrovksy says. “We thought the whole point of preprint was to get important information out quickly.”

The paper was subsequently posted on a different preprint server called arXiv.org, based out of Cornell University. Soon reporters came calling, but most were from right-wing news outlets representing what Petrovsky calls “the Murdoch press.” Petrovsky says he had to work at stopping some tendentious reporters from distorting his paper’s findings to shape a narrative that SARS-CoV-2 had unequivocally been manufactured. And at the same time, he says, other media tried “to make a mockery of the whole possibility of the lab thing.”"

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to ravage the globe and has now caused more than 2.67 million deaths.

An in-depth investigation is now underway in Brittany after genomic sequencing identified eight carriers of the variant among a cluster of 79 cases in the town of Lannion in the Côtes d'Armor on the 13th of March.

On Monday, the health ministry said in a statement that initial analyses of the variant do not suggest that this new strain is more transmissible or causes more severe disease than previous viral strains.

However, in a press conference on Tuesday, health officials said the failure of PCR tests to detect the virus is raising concerns.

Belgian virologist and interfederal COVID-19 spokesperson Steven Van Gucht clarified that about eight individuals presented with typical coronavirus symptoms, ""but the tests remained negative.""

The announcement comes as France sees a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 cases, with President Emmanuel Macron warning that new lockdown measures could be implemented in the days to come.

WHO categorizes new strain as ""variant under investigation""

The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized the new strain as a ""variant under investigation"" (VUI) rather than a ""variant of concern"" (VOC) like the strains that were recently identified in Brazil, the UK and South Africa.

The VUI category includes thousands of naturally occurring variants, of which only a small fraction are likely to pose any risk to public health.

Investigations are currently underway to better understand the variant and its response to the protective antibodies generated following previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against the virus.

However, as Gucht reminded people on Tuesday, it is expected that new variants will emerge as viruses constantly evolve mutations in their genome.

What about the testing?

Furthermore, many different tests are used by different laboratories, and it is possible that a particular test may have problems detecting a certain variant, added Gucht.

""That does not necessarily mean that this is the case for all other tests – quite the contrary,"" he said.

Each test detects one to three different parts of the virus and different tests can detect different parts.

""Usually, a good test does not depend on detecting one specific part. So, if there is a mutation in one part of the virus, that signal may be lost, but there is usually a second or third signal that will be found,"" said Gucht.

Authorities are implementing the necessary monitoring and support

In the meantime, French health authorities are implementing the necessary monitoring and support measures.

Public Health France and the National Reference Centers has set up a system for detecting and monitoring potential cases or carriers of the new VUI across areas including Lannion, Guingamp, Saint-Brieuc and Morlaix.

The general health directorate has also alerted health establishments and health professionals that the variant is being monitored.

Finally, as a precautionary measure, local authorities, prefectures and the Regional Health Agency are stepping up measures to mitigate viral spread by speeding up vaccination and reminding people about the importance of protective measures such as social distancing and restricting the number of people at gatherings."

What

When variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) emerged in late 2020, concern arose that they might elude protective immune responses generated by prior infection or vaccination, potentially making re-infection more likely or vaccination less effective. To investigate this possibility, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues analyzed blood cell samples from 30 people who had contracted and recovered from COVID-19 prior to the emergence of virus variants. They found that one key player in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2—the CD8+ T cell—remained active against the virus.

The research team was led by NIAID’s Andrew Redd, Ph.D., and included scientists from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Immunomics-focused company, ImmunoScape.

The investigators asked whether CD8+ T cells in the blood of recovered COVID-19 patients, infected with the initial virus, could still recognize three SARS-CoV-2 variants: B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the United Kingdom; B.1.351, originally found in the Republic of South Africa; and B.1.1.248, first seen in Brazil. Each variant has mutations throughout the virus, and, in particular, in the region of the virus’ spike protein that it uses to attach to and enter cells. Mutations in this spike protein region could make it less recognizable to T cells and neutralizing antibodies, which are made by the immune system’s B cells following infection or vaccination.

Although details about the exact levels and composition of antibody and T-cell responses needed to achieve immunity to SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown, scientists assume that strong and broad responses from both antibodies and T cells are required to mount an effective immune response. CD8+ T cells limit infection by recognizing parts of the virus protein presented on the surface of infected cells and killing those cells.

In their study of recovered COVID-19 patients, the researchers determined that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses remained largely intact and could recognize virtually all mutations in the variants studied. While larger studies are needed, the researchers note that their findings suggest that the T cell response in convalescent individuals, and most likely in vaccinees, are largely not affected by the mutations found in these three variants, and should offer protection against emerging variants.

Optimal immunity to SARS-Cov-2 likely requires strong multivalent T-cell responses in addition to neutralizing antibodies and other responses to protect against current SARS-CoV-2 strains and emerging variants, the authors indicate. They stress the importance of monitoring the breadth, magnitude and durability of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses in recovered and vaccinated individuals as part of any assessment to determine if booster vaccinations are needed.

If the number of cases is growing exponentially, the capacity of contact tracing to make a difference can be rapidly outpaced.","sarscov2, perfect, testing, mitigate, outbreaks, lowsensitivity, contact, transmissions, tracing, tests, individuals, enemy, strategies, covid19, contacts, good, transmission, test",SarS,pandemic,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and individuals have attempted a wide variety of strategies to limit the damage of the pandemic on human lives, population health, and economies. Contact tracing has been a commonly used strategy, and various approaches have been proposed and attempted. We summarise some methods of contact tracing and testing, considering the resources demanded by each and how features of SARS-CoV-2 transmission affect their effectiveness. We also propose an approach focusing on tracing transmission events, which can be particularly effective when superspreading events play a large role in transmission. Accounting for the best available evidence on a pathogen and for the availability of resources can make control strategies more effective, even if they are not perfect.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing has generally been used with presumptive quarantine of contacts. This approach has been used in the USA, implemented by individual states, and in the UK.However, contact tracing does not need to involve only presumptive quarantine; other strategies, such as active monitoring or testing contacts and acting according to the test results, have been proposed.There are also many different ways to identify potential contacts, including personal outreach by public health workers, automated notification through mobile phone apps, or combinations of these approaches.

Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, the impact of test and trace interventions, and the risk of occurrence of a second COVID-19 epidemic wave in the UK: a modelling study.

Contact tracing can take many forms, depending on the features of its target infectious disease.In any form, however, it relies on substantial public health investment and public acceptance and participation, including the collaboration of infected individuals, who must share their potential contacts, and of the identified contacts, who must follow appropriate public health protocols.It also depends on how accurately and completely people who are infected recall their potential contacts, and on the ability of public health agencies to locate and deliver effective interventions to those contacts.Without these elements, contact tracing can be slow and lead to an ineffective response.Indeed, if cases start to increase exponentially, contact tracing can become a poor use of restricted resources.

Contact tracing has a long history in public health and has been used nearly universally during the COVID-19 pandemic.So-called test and trace strategies, which rely on routine and symptomatic surveillance to identify cases and then trace their possible contacts, have been shown to be effective in some areas.These strategies are especially important to prevent successive waves of outbreaks when social distancing measures are relaxed and schools and businesses reopen.

Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, the impact of test and trace interventions, and the risk of occurrence of a second COVID-19 epidemic wave in the UK: a modelling study.

The transmission tracing approach relies on the availability of a rapid, high-specificity test. The test sensitivity, however, does not need to be high. Figure 2 shows how, even with low-sensitivity tests, transmission tracing can lead to a reduced burden on contacts by requiring fewer contacts to isolate, while still resulting in the isolation of a high proportion of infected contacts. These proportions vary as the dispersion of the number of secondary cases per index case, parameterised by k, varies; a lower value of k indicates more overdispersion. Overdispersed transmission arises when many infected individuals transmit to few (or even no) contacts, whereas some transmit to many contacts.More overdispersion leads to a higher rate of superspreading events, in which a large number of individuals are infected by a single source, as has been seen for COVID-19.Such events illustrate how models can explain how one key feature of the pathogen's transmission affects the relative effectiveness of different test, trace, and isolate strategies. The code for this analysis is available online;assumptions can be altered and more complex models can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of transmission tracing in a specific setting. Mathematical details are available in appendix pp 1–2

Proportion of secondary cases isolated under the transmission tracing strategy (top row) and proportion of index cases whose contacts are isolated under the transmission tracing strategy (bottom row) versus test sensitivity by Rand k. The diagonal line in the top row indicates the proportion of secondary cases who test positive and are isolated under strategy C ( figure 1 ).

Variations in the implementation of the approach can account for variability in the timing of recall and testing of contacts. The ideal approach involves near-simultaneous testing of contacts. However, depending on the balance of the benefits of each approach, contacts can be isolated until a sufficient number of contacts have tested negative, or contacts who test negative can forgo isolation until any other contact tests positive, regardless of the rate at which tests are done. More complex risk-based approaches can also be used, as suggested for symptom monitoring in contact tracing.

We propose two processes of transmission tracing with rapid, high-sensitivity tests: one based on forward tracing, and another based on backward tracing ( panel ), shown schematically in figure 1 along with other contact tracing strategies. In describing this approach, we use the phrase isolation of contacts (as opposed to quarantine), even for those who test negative, because this approach treats them as presumptive positives. Depending on the setting, other epidemiological control measures might be more appropriate for the presumptive positives and these can be used in the next step of the transmission tracing process ( panel ). Both of these approaches rely on the key point that identification of exposure to a common transmission event is far more informative of the infection state of other individuals than is identification of exposure to a person with a positive test result alone.

Transmission tracing (A). Quarantine of all identified contacts (B). Isolation of contacts who are tested and found to be positive for the pathogen (C).

Similarly, if an individual tests positive and the source of infection can be identified, treat all contacts of the source as presumptive positives as described above

Immediately isolate all contacts and do more thorough epidemiological assessments of these individuals Control measures can include more sensitive testing, active monitoring, presumptive quarantine, or self-isolation (with appropriate support measures to ensure it can be followed), and tracing of their contacts, potentially using this same strategy

Quarantining contacts of a known case to prevent onward transmission is not the only approach to contact tracing. The strategy of backward contact tracing has been a key part of the pandemic response in some locations. With backward contact tracing, when an index case is identified, the tracers attempt to identify the source of infection (either an infected individual or a transmission event), and then forward trace from that source to identify new infections and halt transmission by immediately isolating all contacts.This strategy has several advantages, especially for a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, which transmits in clusters, and which many infected individuals do not transmit at all.For such a pathogen, it is important to identify the source of infection when not known because there is a high probability that an infected invididual who has transmitted the virus at least once will transmit multiple times. Knowledge of the source is particularly useful in stopping outbreaks starting from individual imported cases.

The efficiency of mass testing can also be improved with group testing, where samples from multiple individuals are combined and the pool is tested for the presence of virus. A positive result leads to follow up of the individuals who contributed to that sample. This method allows for quicker and less expensive mass testing, but can delay the time to confirmation of an individual's infection status.Group testing can be particularly effective in settings where superspreading events are probable, if the groups are likely to include multiple individuals with the same exposures to infection.

Modelling studies have shown that frequency of testing is more important than high sensitivity of tests for outbreak control.The turnaround time from testing to results and isolation of infected individuals is also a crucial factor.These factors depend heavily on the tests available and their cost, as well as the ability to ensure compliance with regular testing.In all cases, by identifying currently asymptomatic infections, regular testing reduced case counts compared with symptomatic testing alone.

In addition to contact tracing, routine surveillance testing, with isolation of individuals who test positive, has been proposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic without large-scale stay-at-home orders.Routine surveillance testing can be done independently or in combination with some type of contact tracing.There is a range of possibilities, depending on the setting and the available testing infrastructure, and which we group into three large categories: standard assays at moderate frequencies, less-sensitive tests at higher frequencies, and regular pooled or group testing.

Other features of the specific pathogen and its transmission, as well as the local setting, should also be considered when deciding on a strategy or mix of strategies. The structure of contacts in a location is particularly important, as societies with more interaction across age or risk groups might require different methods.The variation in viral load between individuals, and the consequence of this variation on the likelihood of transmission, is also important. If viral load is highly correlated with infectiousness, tests that identify only high viral loads will be more effective at halting transmission.As more is learned about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, the appropriate control measures should be regularly reconsidered.

Because contact tracing and testing efforts also depend on the speed of testing and tracing, cost to public health resources, burden on individuals, and acceptability of interventions to individuals, we consider these factors as well.Many of these approaches depend on the willingness and ability of individuals to identify and recall potential contacts, so contact tracing or testing programmes with less severe interventions or less likelihood of quarantine or isolation for contacts might lead to higher reporting of contacts or higher uptake of testing, and those that can occur more rapidly (eg, by use of a point-of-care test) might reduce recall bias by reducing the time delay.For example, transmission tracing can have a reduced efficacy when contacts are missed because it results in a lower probability of isolating recalled contacts who were infected. However, this reduced efficacy can be offset, in some settings, by the higher acceptability of the approach. The factors that make a contact tracing or testing programme effective are not independent from the programme's features, but are closely related. These features can be adjusted to improve acceptability of the programme, even at some cost to its absolute efficacy, in ways that improve real-world effectiveness.

Various modelling and simulation studies have assessed these strategies individually in different settings, and we refer interested readers to these studies for more details.We summarise selected strategies for control, noting some of their advantages and disadvantages ( table ). In particular, we consider the effect of overdispersed transmission and the presence of superspreading events in this comparison. These features lead to transmission tracing being more effective than traditional contact tracing at controlling transmission, with a lower burden on uninfected individuals, and lead to pooled testing being more efficient if the pool groups are probable transmission clusters. Backward contact tracing can also be more valuable, as the index cases are more likely to have been infected in superspreading events.Most other methods have increased variability due to overdispersed transmission, as any undetected transmissions are potentially more consequential for onward spread.

Many of the strategies described here can be implemented by use of current technologies, techniques, and tests. Some, however, can be improved by the approval and use of new tests. High-frequency testing is ideally suited for the use of rapid, inexpensive tests, even if they are of lower sensitivity than current assays.The short turnaround time of these tests is especially important for mass testing and isolation, and is also useful for contact tracing because it enables tracers to talk to index cases earlier, when contact recall might be higher. Rapid tests would also be valuable for transmission tracing and backward contact tracing because they are most likely to identify superspreading events, where multiple individuals have been infected. Although rapid tests with lower sensitivity can allow some individual cases to go undetected, such tests would detect most of the major transmission events, providing a good opportunity for appropriate isolation and quarantine measures to halt onward transmission. This approach might provide the best use of scarce public health resources.Rapid tests are even more effective if they are more sensitive to high viral loads, as might be true for antigen tests, and high viral loads contribute to the likelihood of superspreading events and onward transmission of high viral loads.Tests that can contribute to important public health efforts, and not just those that are most clinically useful for diagnosis, should be approved.

et al. First proof of the capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 in India through detection of genetic material of SARS-CoV-2. We have discussed how rapid tests that are highly specific, but not necessarily very sensitive, could be added to control strategies making use of contact tracing. However, it must be recognised that contact tracing is only expected to be useful for control when the prevalence of a pathogen in a given population is low. If the number of cases is growing exponentially, the capacity of contact tracing to make a difference can be rapidly outpaced. Situational awareness can be maintained by rapid self-administered tests of the type we discuss here, but it could be enhanced by other surveillance methods, including environmental surveillance, for example of wastewater. Wastewater surveillance has a long history in detecting outbreaks of viruses such as polio, and has been applied to SARS-CoV-2 in several different settings.None of these approaches are expected to solve the problem on their own, or allow a community to return to normal. However, they might help communities to manage the pandemic far more comfortably and with less risk of surges in infections, which add pressure on health-care facilities.

There will always be uncertainty as to the value of any control method in stopping an infectious disease. However, with modelling and understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, it is possible to estimate which methods will be most effective in specific conditions. As new tests, with different sensitivities and specificities, are approved, or new contact tracing apps are rolled out, the ability to use and combine different strategies will continue to expand. Many methods have been proposed and we consider a selection of test, trace, and isolate methods here. Different populations and locations should appropriately weigh the balance between resource availability, the burden on individuals, and the risks of future surges of disease. These considerations should include and account for the best evidence on the transmission of the pathogen in estimating the efficacy of various strategies. Waiting for the perfect test or the perfect control method must not prevent the implementation of good control measures as soon as possible."

How much did SARS-CoV-2 need to change in order to adapt to its new human host? In a research article published in the open access journal PLOS Biology Oscar MacLean, Spyros Lytras at the University of Glasgow, and colleagues, show that since December 2019 and for the first 11 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been very little 'important' genetic change observed in the hundreds of thousands of sequenced virus genomes.

The study is a collaboration between researchers in the UK, US and Belgium. The lead authors Prof David L Robertson (at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Scotland) and Prof Sergei Pond (at the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia) were able to turn their experience of analysing data from HIV and other viruses to SARS-CoV-2. Pond's state-of-the-art analytical framework, HyPhy, was instrumental in teasing out the signatures of evolution embedded in the virus genomes and rests on decades of theoretical knowledge on molecular evolutionary processes.

First author Dr. Oscar MacLean explains, ""This does not mean no changes have occurred, mutations of no evolutionary significance accumulate and 'surf' along the millions of transmission events, like they do in all viruses."" Some changes can have an effect; for example, the Spike replacement D614G which has been found to enhance transmissibility and certain other tweaks of virus biology scattered over its genome. On the whole, though, 'neutral' evolutionary processes have dominated. MacLean adds, ""This stasis can be attributed to the highly susceptible nature of the human population to this new pathogen, with limited pressure from population immunity, and lack of containment, leading to exponential growth making almost every virus a winner.""

Pond comments, ""what's been so surprising is just how transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has been from the outset. Usually viruses that jump to a new host species take some time to acquire adaptations to be as capable as SARS-CoV-2 at spreading, and most never make it past that stage, resulting in dead-end spillovers or localised outbreaks.""

Studying the mutational processes of SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses (the group of viruses SARS-CoV-2 belongs to from bats and pangolins), the authors find evidence of fairly significant change, but all before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. This means that the 'generalist' nature of many coronaviruses and their apparent facility to jump between hosts, imbued SARS-CoV-2 with ready-made ability to infect humans and other mammals, but those properties most have probably evolved in bats prior to spillover to humans.

Joint first author and Ph.D. student Spyros Lytras adds, ""Interestingly, one of the closer bat viruses, RmYN02, has an intriguing genome structure made up of both SARS-CoV-2-like and bat-virus-like segments. Its genetic material carries both distinct composition signatures (associated with the action of host anti-viral immunity), supporting this change of evolutionary pace occurred in bats without the need for an intermediate animal species.""

Robertson comments, ""the reason for the 'shifting of gears' of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of its increased rate of evolution at the end of 2020, associated with more heavily mutated lineages, is because the immunological profile of the human population has changed."" The virus towards the end of 2020 was increasingly coming into contact with existing host immunity as numbers of previously infected people are now high. This will select for variants that can dodge some of the host response. Coupled with the evasion of immunity in longer-term infections in chronic cases (e.g., in immunocompromised patients), these new selective pressures are increasing the number of important virus mutants.

It's important to appreciate SARS-CoV-2 still remains an acute virus, cleared by the immune response in the vast majority of infections. However, it's now moving away faster from the January 2020 variant used in all of the current vaccines to raise protective immunity. The current vaccines will continue to work against most of the circulating variants but the more time that passes, and the bigger the differential between vaccinated and not-vaccinated numbers of people, the more opportunity there will be for vaccine escape. Robertson adds, ""The first race was to develop a vaccine. The race now is to get the global population vaccinated as quickly as possible.""

Danish vaccine campaign

The campaign in Denmark commenced at the end of 2020, and used the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. BNT162b2 is built on the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) platform, and encodes the immunodominant viral spike antigen.

The first round of vaccination prioritized residents of long-term care facilities and healthcare workers (HCWs) working on the frontline. The current paper deals with estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) in these two groups.

Study details

The researchers performed a retrospective study based on all care home residents and HCWs, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They then estimated the VE after the first and the second dose at varying time points.

The study included over 39,000 care home residents and over 3,31,000 HCWs. The median age of the former was 84 years, and of the latter, 47 years. About 95% of care home residents received the first dose of the vaccine, and 86% the second dose, between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021.

Among HCWs, about 28% and 24% received the first and second doses during this period.

The vaccine used for 99% of care home residents, and ~90% of HCWs, was the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

What are the results?

Follow-up was continued for a median of 53 days. The researchers found that the proportion of cases among vaccinated care home residents after one dose was not significantly different from that among the unvaccinated in the same group.

However, during the first week after the second dose, there were 57 cases of COVID-19 among care home residents during this period, and 52 in the HCW group. Beyond this period, there were 27 and 10 cases, respectively.

The total number of infections among care home residents after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine was therefore 84. Overall, there were ~1,500 cases during this period among care home residents and over 7,000 among HCWs.

In comparison, there were almost 490 infections among unvaccinated care home residents and over 5,660 among unvaccinated HCWs.

Thus, the first dose showed no protective efficacy among care home residents. Among HCWs, the VE at 14+ days from the first dose but before the second dose was 17%.

When evaluated at seven days following the second dose, VE was 52% and 46% in care home residents and in HCWs, respectively. After this period, it went up to 64% and 90% in these groups.

These results are obtained after adjusting for the effects of sex, age and other medical conditions.

What are the implications?

The scientists found hope in these results, which showed high VE soon after administering the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. This study is extremely useful as it is among the earliest to report the real-life VE of this vaccine after two doses. Earlier studies have been limited to reporting the interim VE after the first dose.

The VE of 90% and 64% after two doses, among care home residents and HCWs, respectively, strengthens the case for providing this regimen worldwide. The elderly, who make up a large proportion of care home residents, are especially at risk, especially as they often have multiple comorbidities.

Moreover, the weakened immune system among the elderly is a cause for doubt about the efficacy of vaccination in this group. Here again, the VE of 64% indicates the utility of this vaccine in protecting the elderly against the severity of COVID-19.

The national incidence of COVID-19 was at its peak when the vaccine program began, and many care home residents were being infected. As a result, a partial lockdown was implemented in the region a few weeks prior to the immunization program. Therefore, the unadjusted VE was higher than the final results, which could be in part due to the effects of this measure.

In addition, the high rate of vaccination among care home residents may have led to an overestimation of the observed VE, since the infection risk would have been sharply reduced by the high vaccine coverage within this closed setting.

While these findings corroborate other studies that indicate the importance of a two-dose schedule with BNT162b2, a more extended period of follow-up between the prime and boost dose could help to elicit the full protective impact of a delayed-second-dose regimen.

Credit: Viacheslav Lopatin/Shutterstock.com.

Despite the theoretical potential of inactivated virus vaccines to offer a lead over other Covid-19 vaccine technologies against variants of concern, experts said they are unlikely to be a long-term solution. While it is logical that these vaccines could have better efficacy against variants that have mutations in the spike protein, they come with existing baggage such as relatively lower efficacy versus other Covid-19 vaccines, they noted. And though inactivated virus vaccines have an edge in initiating a T-cell response, the overall value of this mechanism is still unclear in the context of Covid-19 vaccine development, some added.

Recently discovered variants that are more infectious have thrown a wrench in the vaccine development race, owing to their potential to dampen the efficacy of the current crop of Covid-19 vaccines designed to target the original SARS-CoV-2. The three variants of concern were first detected in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK, respectively named P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.1.7.

According to 17 February news reports, São Paolo-headquartered Instituto Butantan head Dimas Covas said Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac’s advantage versus the variants of concern is that it uses an inactivated version of SARS-CoV-2. Immunobiologic and vaccine producer Butantan sponsored the Brazil-based Phase III CoronaVac trial. China state-owned Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV and India-headquartered Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin are the other authorized inactivated virus vaccines.

Adenovirus-vectored vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson’s JNJ-78436735 and the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca’s authorized AZD1222 have data showing their vaccines are negatively impacted by B.1.351. These vaccines could improve their efficacy against the variants of concern by adding other antigens on top of the spike protein, some noted. However, experts agreed this may not be a realistic option, as it would complicate production lines and increase manufacturing costs, without the guaranteed efficacy benefit.

The aforementioned companies and institutions did not respond to a comment request, while Sinopharm could not be reached.

Logical at surface level but many caveats underneath

It is possible that an inactivated virus vaccine may induce a broader immune system response than vaccines that only feature the spike protein, said Stanley Perlman, professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa. Since the existing variants of concern have critical mutations in the spike, inactivated virus vaccines could theoretically offer an advantage for protection against these variants, added Dr Diane Griffin, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.

Butantan’s Covas announced CoronaVac is effective against B.1.351 and B.1.1.7, citing China-based results, while investigations against the local P.1 variant are ongoing. B.1.1.7 is characterised by a deletion in the spike protein, while there is a spike mutation in P.1 and B.1.351. Vaccine developers have been most interested in B.1.351 owing to preclinical and clinical trial data showing it can weaken vaccine efficacy. 23 February news reports show Bharat chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said the company can re-engineer its Covaxin vaccine within 15 days once it can access an isolated strain of B.1.351.

Also potentially supporting inactivated virus vaccines is that natural infection may lead to better protection from reinfection than vaccines, noted Gary Kobinger, PhD, head, Vector Design and Immunotherapy Special Pathogens, Medical Microbiology, University of Manitoba, Canada. This is due to the immune system developing familiarity to the viral life cycle that a vaccine that only carries a single antigen is not able to offer, Kobinger explained. Other SARS-CoV-2 proteins may be better geared to trigger a T-cell response, where the immune system recognises infected cells, noted Alan Parker, PhD, reader in virology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University. In contrast, neutralising antibodies defuse the virus itself, Parker added.

Dr Maria Elena Bottazzi, associate dean, National School of Tropical Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, differed, noting a vaccine featuring a specific antigen is likely to be superior to natural infection, as the vaccine elicits a targeted immune response. And so, inactivated virus vaccines’ broader immune response may not necessarily translate to a boost in vaccine efficacy, even against variants of concern, Perlman noted.

While initiating a T-cell response is ideal, neutralising antibody increase seems to be most relevant to COVID-19 vaccines, Perlman added. Even if there is a vaccine-triggered T-cell upsurge, the person can still develop symptoms if neutralising antibodies are not generated, agreed Nikolai Petrovsky, PhD, professor, College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia. Neutralising antibody data from inactivated virus vaccines are not as high as other vaccine technologies that only feature the spike, Bottazzi noted.

But Kobinger was more cautious, noting the value of neutralising antibody increase should not be overestimated. In Ebola, there is a very weak link between neutralising antibodies to protection, he added. Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV appears to trigger slightly lower neutralising antibody titres against B.1.351 compared with the original SARS-CoV-2, according to a laboratory study using 12 serum samples from vaccinated individuals (Huang, B, et al., BioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.01.429069).

Further dampening enthusiasm for inactivated virus vaccines to combat variants of concern is that their efficacy profile against the original SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear, added Kobinger. Efficacy data from other COVID-19 vaccines, particularly with mRNA vaccines, show that focusing on a single part of SARS-CoV-2 may be the best approach, experts agreed. Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s two-dose mRNA vaccines mRNA-1273 and Comirnaty (BNT162b2), respectively, have efficacy north of 94%.

On the other hand, inactivated virus vaccines’ efficacy has generally been lower, though cross-trial comparisons come with inherent caveats. Sinovac’s CoronaVac efficacy in three clinical trials with data was 50.4% (Brazil), 65.3% (Indonesia) and 91.25% (Turkey). Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV showed 79% interim efficacy (China-based registrational trials) and 86% (UAE). Bharat is yet to report Phase III (CTRI/2020/11/028976) Covaxin protection data; it garnered “clinical trial mode” emergency use authorisation in India in early January.

There is, however, head-to-head trial data from an influenza vaccine trial demonstrating that having excess epitopes in an inactivated virus vaccine does not lead to better efficacy, Petrovsky noted. In a Phase III trial, Sanofi’s Flublok, which only features recombinant hemagglutinin, demonstrated 30% lower probability of influenza-like illness than whole inactivated virus vaccine IIV4 (p=0.006; Dunkle, L, et al., N Engl J Med. 2017.Jun 22;376(25):2427-2436). And even if a vaccine features the whole SARS-CoV-2, mutations do not just happen in the spike protein but everywhere in the virus, Bottazzi added.

A possible side effect concern with inactivated virus vaccines is enhanced disease when a vaccine receiver is infected, Griffin said. And so, a vaccinated person who gets infected can develop an inflammatory condition called immune complex disease, she explained.

Adenovirus vectors large enough for additional viral proteins

While adenovirus-vectored vaccines’ efficacy seems to be prone to variants of concern, there are ways for the technology to potentially bolster their efficacy profiles. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein could be added as it is better conserved than the spike protein, Kobinger said. In addition, the nucleoprotein is the second most immunogenic target based on experience with SARS-CoV vaccine development, he added.

Adenoviruses are large enough to fit in many SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as adenoviruses can fit in as many as 36,000 bases, added Parker. Besides spike and nucleocapsid proteins, SARS-CoV-2 has envelope and membrane proteins.

JNJ-78436735 and AZD1222 only feature the spike protein. A 7 February University of Oxford media statement shows two-dose AZD1222 provides minimal protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 from B.1.531. Due to this, South Africa’s vaccine rollout of AZD1222 was put on hold in favour of JNJ-78436735.

But even JNJ-78436735’s efficacy seems to have been affected by the new variant. In the South Africa cohort of the Phase III ENSEMBLE trial, single-dose JNJ-78436735 had 57% efficacy in protection against moderate-to-severe COVID-19, which was 72% in the US cohort and 66% in the Brazil cohort, according to a 29 January media release. Some 94.5% of cases in the South Africa cohort were due to B.1.531, according to Johnson & Johnson’s briefing document for today’s (26 February) FDA advisory committee meeting.

But putting in two to three different SARS-CoV-2 proteins does not guarantee higher immune responses against all these proteins, Parker added. The immune system may favourably pick one protein to develop an immune response against, he noted. Protective immunity for the host will be against the spike, as it is the most relevant protein for viral entry, Bottazzi noted. Other SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins are more relevant in replication, she explained. The spike protein was chosen because it is immunodominant and the immune system can recognise it, Parker added.

Also, having more than one antigen in a vaccine is uncommon, as it adds another level of complexity in manufacturing, Petrovsky said. Such complexity would impact production efficiencies and increase production costs, while the efficacy benefit is nebulous, he added.

As for mRNA vaccines, both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech announced this week Phase I investigations to add a third dose to address B.1.351. Moderna’s mRNA-1273.351 is also under consideration as part of a two-dose approach, where the booster would be mRNA-1273.211, which combines the original and new vaccine permutations. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines would be at a disadvantage during a potential revaccination campaign due to likely antivector responses triggered by initial vaccinations, this news service reported 12 February.

A new study by researchers at Imperial College London, UK, discusses the effect of a vaccine dose, specifically the BNT162b2 candidate (also known as the ‘Pfizer-BioNTech’ vaccine), on neutralizing antibody titers in individuals who have already been infected with the virus.

Single-dose regimen

The UK government has already vaccinated many healthcare workers (HCWs) and other front-line workers with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. To expand coverage and contain the spike in cases, the interval between vaccine doses has been increased to 12 weeks.

Not much information is available on the results of single-dose vaccination. Moreover, the nature of responses to vaccination following natural infection remains unclear. The current study explores the serology, neutralizing responses and T cell responses to a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

The study includes 72 HCWs who were vaccinated in the same week. The BNT162b2 mRNA encodes the spike antigen of the virus.

Infected prior to vaccination

Baseline blood samples at the time of their first dose showed antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid and spike (anti-S) proteins in 16 patients. Another five patients had strong T cell reactivity to non-spike viral antigens after vaccination and were also considered to have had prior viral exposure.

The immune response in this group did not show any correlation with age.

The remaining 51 participants were negative for immune responses to the virus and were called infection-naïve.

Higher antibody to spike after vaccination

After one dose of the vaccine, the participants showed markedly higher antibodies to the spike antigen if they had a history of natural infection compared to the naïve individuals. The median anti-spike titer was ~16,000 AU/mL in the first group, versus ~600 AU/mL in the second, indicating an almost 30-fold difference.

The five participants with isolated T cell responses had spike antibody responses following vaccination that was somewhere between the seropositive group and the naïve group.

The naïve group developed antibody titers inversely correlated with age. Those above 50 years had a substantially weaker response to the vaccine compared with younger participants, at a median of ~200 AU/mL, versus 900 AU/mL.

Live virus neutralization

To examine the neutralizing capacity of the vaccine-induced antibodies, the researchers tested four samples each from the infected and naïve groups, before vaccination, for liver virus neutralization on Vero cells.

Another post-vaccination sample set was also tested at 12 naïve versus three infected samples.

The researchers found very strong neutralizing responses had been induced in those with previous exposure, even in those whose baseline neutralization titers had been undetectable or very low.

In contrast, naïve individuals showed neutralizing activity in 15/16 sera, but with much lower titers. The 50% neutralization titers, NT50, showed a twenty-fold difference, at 1/30 for this group, compared to 1/1,600 for the infected group.

T cell responses

The study also examined T cell responses following vaccination using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) against a set of five viral peptide pools. They found very strong T cell responses to the spike peptides in the previously infected subjects following vaccination, at over ten-fold the median responses in naïve individuals.

In fact, about half of the 48 participants in this part of the study had negative T cell responses. There was no correlation between age and T cell response.

Thus, a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to create strong humoral and cellular responses in individuals who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2, associated with high live virus neutralizing capacity. Both neutralizing antibody and T cell responses are weak, in contrast, among the infection-naïve group, following one dose.

What are the implications?

The study shows that robust immunity is generated following vaccination in people with a history of prior infection. On the contrary, a proportion of previously uninfected people show very poor responses to the vaccine, hinting that both clinical disease and viral shedding might occur in this subset.

Moreover, the immunity level may be too low to persist for the newly determined 12-week interval until the second dose. Anecdotally, it may be observed that one such individual developed clinical disease, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), at five weeks from the first dose of vaccine, with the anti-spike antibody titer after vaccination being 60 AU/mL.

The age-dependent decrease in vaccine-elicited immune responses seen in the infection-naïve group is an obvious concern. Of the group of ten who were older than 50, seroconversion did not occur, and eight had low antibody titers below 250 AU/mL, insufficient for neutralization as judged by the relationship between anti-S antibody levels and virus neutralization in the current assay.

Not only is this group at higher risk of severe disease, but they show a minimal vaccine response, according to these findings.

This may indicate the need to prioritize infection-naïve individuals and those over 50 years for a complete vaccination regimen. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to be alert even after vaccination, including the use of personal protective equipment as before, to avoid either contracting infection or spreading the virus via asymptomatic viral shedding."

While this is significantly faster than for all other vaccines, developers leveraged existing vaccine technology and a concerted global effort — working alongside health authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — to work at this pace.

Vaccine developers worked under unprecedented conditions to develop vaccines against COVID-19 after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in late 2019. It took less than a year for the first COVID-19 vaccines to gain authorization for use.

There are 12 vaccines against COVID-19 that have authorization for use in various locations around the world.

All vaccines work by training the immune system to respond to future infection. Vaccines are overwhelmingly safe for the majority of people who receive them, and they do not cause disease.

COVID-19 vaccines work by introducing the immune system to an inactivated form of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus or a part of it. This does not cause COVID-19 but equips the body to fight against future infection with the virus.

Although all of the COVID-19 vaccines in use around the world aim to achieve the same goal — namely, protection from COVID-19 — they employ different vaccine technologies.

Some vaccines are based on the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, others use only parts of it, and some do not use any material derived directly from the virus.

The sections below provide an overview of the different types of COVID-19 vaccines that have authorization for use in at least one country.

mRNA vaccines

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna developed are the first mRNA vaccines authorized for use in humans outside of clinical trials. However, the technology is not new.

Scientists have been working on mRNA vaccine candidates for infectious diseases and cancer for a number of years.

mRNA vaccines do not contain any part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Instead, they carry a chemically synthesized piece of messenger (m)RNA that contains the information necessary for our own cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Our cells make this protein and present it to our immune system, which responds by creating antibodies and developing longer lasting immunity in the form of T cell and B cell responses.

It is not possible to develop COVID-19 from an mRNA vaccine because it does not carry the instructions necessary to make the entire coronavirus.

Viral vector vaccines

Like mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines also do not contain the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus. They use a harmless virus to deliver the gene that allows our cells to make the spike protein.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines are all viral vector vaccines that use different adenoviruses as the delivery system, or vector. Adenoviruses can cause the common cold, and there are many different types of adenoviruses that can infect different species.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector called ChAdOx1. The Russian Sputnik V vaccine uses two different human adenovirus vectors called Ad26 and Ad5. Johnson & Johnson also use the Ad26 virus in their vaccine.

All three vaccines contain the gene for the spike protein and deliver this into cells after injection. The cells then make the spike protein and present it to our immune system.

As with mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines do not carry the information necessary for our cells to make the entire SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, they cannot cause COVID-19.

Subunit vaccines

Like mRNA and viral vector vaccines, subunit vaccines only use a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, rather than providing our cells with the genetic code necessary to make a viral protein, subunit vaccines deliver the protein directly.

The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine candidate is a subunit vaccine. Scientists produced large amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a laboratory for this experimental vaccine. Novavax use insect cells to grow the proteins before purifying them. The purified proteins then form nanoparticles.

On their own, the protein nanoparticles may not produce a strong enough immune reaction, so Novavax add an adjuvant. This is a chemical that stimulates the immune system.

Subunit vaccines do not carry enough viral material to make the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, they cannot cause COVID-19.

Read more about subunit vaccines here.

Inactivated vaccines

Unlike mRNA, viral vector, and subunit vaccines, inactivated vaccines contain the entire SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the virus is chemically modified to inactivate it, which means that it cannot cause disease.

Sinovac, Sinopharm, and Bharat Biotech all use a chemical called beta-propiolactone to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their vaccines. The chemical modifies the virus’s genetic material.

Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines cannot cause COVID-19, as the virus cannot make copies of itself.

This type of vaccine does not produce as strong an immune reaction as some others, and the resulting immunity may not be as long lasting. Sinovac, Sinopharm, and Bharat Biotech use adjuvants in their COVID-19 vaccines to generate a stronger immune response.

To provide immunity in the long run, it may be necessary to receive booster shots after receiving an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.

One of the biggest questions has been whether the emerging variants will respond differently to neutralizing antibodies made by people who have been infected. This point is important to understand, as it may alter the ability of our current arsenal of therapeutics and vaccines to combat the infection.

Now, new research from the labs at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, suggests that two of the variants, the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variants (first detected in South Africa and the U.K., respectively), show increased resistance to antibody neutralization in laboratory experiments. The findings suggest that current antibody therapies and vaccines may be less effective against some variants of the virus.

This work is published in Nature, in the paper, “Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7.” A preprint of the study was first posted to BioRxiv on January 26, 2021.

Monoclonal antibodies, which target specific sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are being used in hospitals to treat COVID-19. However, these therapeutics were designed to work against the initial variant of SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in 2019.

David Ho, MD, professor of microbiology & immunology and director, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, and colleagues, assessed the ability of 30 monoclonal antibodies, along with plasma from 20 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and sera from 22 people who have been vaccinated, to neutralize the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants of SARS-CoV-2.

The authors found that the B.1.1.7 variant was resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain of the spike protein and was relatively resistant to some antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain. However, it was not resistant to plasma from patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and sera from individuals who were vaccinated, and the authors suggest that this variant will not have a marked impact on current therapies or vaccines.

However, in addition to resistance to neutralization by antibodies to the N-terminal domain, the B.1.351 variant was found to be resistant to a group of monoclonal antibodies that is currently used in therapies that target the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein, which was primarily attributed to the E484K mutation. The neutralizing activity of plasma from patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and sera from people who had been vaccinated was reduced by approximately 9- and 10–12-fold, respectively, against this variant.

The study’s predictions are being borne out with the first reported results of the Novavax vaccine, said Ho. “The approximately 2-fold loss of neutralizing activity against the U.K. variant is unlikely to have an adverse impact due to the large ‘cushion’ of residual neutralizing antibody activity,” Ho said, “and we see that reflected in the Novavax results where the vaccine was 85.6% effective against the U.K. variant.”

Data from Ho’s study about the loss in neutralizing activity against the South Africa variant are more worrisome. “The drop in neutralizing activity against the South Africa variant is appreciable, and we’re now seeing, based on the Novavax results, that this is causing a reduction in protective efficacy,” Ho said. The company reported on January 28 that the vaccine was nearly 90% effective in the company’s U.K. trial, but only 49.4% effective in its South Africa trial, where most cases of COVID-19 are caused by the B.1.351 variant.

The new study did not examine the more recent variant found in Brazil (B.1.1.28) but given the similar spike mutations between the Brazil and South Africa variants, Ho said the Brazil variant should behave similarly to the South Africa variant.

They argue that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating in a direction that may cause it to evade current interventions that are directed against the viral spike protein. “Our study and the new clinical trial data show that the virus is traveling in a direction that is causing it to escape from our current vaccines and therapies that are directed against the viral spike,” said Ho.

“If the rampant spread of the virus continues and more critical mutations accumulate, then we may be condemned to chasing after the evolving SARS-CoV-2 continually, as we have long done for influenza virus,” Ho explained. “We have to stop the virus from replicating and that means rolling out vaccine faster and sticking to our mitigation measures like masking and physical distancing. Stopping the spread of the virus will stop the development of further mutations.”"

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors found on human cells, allowing it to gain entry and take over the cell’s machinery for replication.

The treatment results show it works by blocking the host protease-activation function of the spike protein — one of the first steps needed for viral entry.

The researchers write:

Our study reveals analytical, safe, and selective mechanistic insights for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic design and is broadly applicable to the future coronaviridae family members (including mutant variants) exploiting the host protease system for cellular entry.”

The study “An Innovative antibody-based Plug-and-Play strategy for SARS-CoV-2” is available as a preprint on the bioRxiv* server, while the article undergoes peer review.

How they did it

The team hypothesized that they could prevent viral fusion into host cells by targeting both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and furin near the viral infection site. They engineered a 22-IgG1 Fc — a spike protein receptor binding domain-targeting antibody. The researchers incorporated furin substrate sites in the Fc-extended linker region to compete with cellular furin protease function and prevent viral entry. The approach was named FuG1 (Furin-IgG1).

This method could be used alone for the above purpose and used to co-target human lung cell antigens and the spike protein.

Study findings

Given that 293-ACE2 cells could have folate receptor levels similar to those observed in human cancer cells, the team added an anti-FOLR1 farletuzumab in the FuG1 strategy. After two hours of 293-ACE2 cells being exposed and subsequently infected with the coronavirus spike protein, farletuzumab-FuG1, and 22-FuG1 antibodies were added.

Their results showed the FuG1 antibodies helped prevent syncytia formation.

As expected, FuG1 inhibited spike conversion into S2 in a dose dependent manner. GAPDH revival in lysates indicate reversal of cytopathic cellular state. When tested using spike pseudovirus, 22-FuG1 also inhibited proteolytic activation of spike to generate S2 upon addition on cells,” wrote the research team.

The antibodies work in different ways. 22-FuG1 works by targeting furin residues after a delayed spike expression. Meanwhile, the farletuzumab-FuG1 saturates furin by occupying the space of FOLR1+ cells. The researchers confirmed its function and specificity with infected cells by treating spike-infected cell cultures with 50µg 22-IgG1, farletuzumab-FuG1, and 22-FuG1.

Their results showed that farletuzumab-FuG1 showed a 30% risk reduction of developing syncytia. The 22-FuG1 antibodies displayed approximately a 90% risk reduction and partially reduced S2 conversion in lysates.

IC50 values are shown (n=3).

Compared to using IgG1 antibodies, pseudovirus neutralization assays showed the 22-FuG1 antibody strategy was significantly more effective in having specificity against spike-infected cells. The 22-FuG1 antibodies showed a greater than 6-fold neutralizing ability against the spike protein.

The researchers suggest FuG1 antibodies work to prevent viral entry by interfering with the relationship between ACE2 expression and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein.

The described FuG1 strategy gives spike target mediated specificity over described furin and TMPRSS2 small molecule inhibitors. Furthermore, additional antibody dual-specificity based FuG1 co-targeting lung enriched receptor could be easily engineered on the described foundation for high specificity. As epitope of CR3022 does not fully overlap with ACE2-RBD binding, FuG1 antibodies that strictly interfere with ACE2-RBD function are expected to be highly effective,” concluded the research team.

""The detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 replication and the temperature-induced changes in the host innate immune defense mechanisms helps explain why SARS-CoV-2 replicates so well in the upper respiratory tract, and is perhaps why SARS-CoV-2 exhibits higher human-to-human transmissibility than SARS-CoV"", Dijkman explains.","respiratory, sarscov2, immune, sarscov, temperatures, tract, research, better, cells, upper, innate, infection, replicates",SarS,pandemic,"Newswise — ""SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highly similar genetically, generate a homologous repertoire of viral proteins, and use the same receptor to infect human cells. However, despite these similarities, there are also important differences between the two viruses"", says Ronald Dijkman from the Institute for Infectious Diseases (IFIK) at the University of Bern. For example, SARS-CoV infection is characterized by severe disease and inflammation in the lower respiratory tract and infected individuals are only contagious after the onset of symptoms, making it easier to identify and interrupt infection chains.

In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 preferentially replicates in the upper airways (nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea) and can be efficiently transmitted from one individual to another before the appearance of disease symptoms. Moreover, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely from person to person, and can manifest as asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease. Older people as well as individuals with certain underlying medical conditions (heart conditions, diabetes, cancer) are at greater risk of developing severe illness, which is often associated with infection of lower respiratory tissues, high levels of inflammation, and lung failure.

Temperature is key

To better understand why infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 result in such different clinical outcomes, researchers from the University of Bern used specialized human airway cell cultures to investigate the impact of respiratory tract temperatures on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. The cells originate from human samples and mimic the complexity of the cells found in the respiratory tract. They grow in special containers, are nourished from the bottom side and are exposed to air on the top side, just like the cells in the human trachea. The cultures also make mucus and have cilia that beat very quickly. ""Because the organization of these cells greatly resembles the cells found in human tissues, they are a relevant system that can be used in a laboratory to study respiratory viruses"", Dijkman explains.

The researchers have now used this existing model for the first time to study the effects of respiratory temperatures on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. They found that temperature plays an important role as SARS-CoV-2 preferred to replicate at temperatures typically found in the upper airways (33°C). Colder incubation temperatures allowed the virus to replicate faster and to a higher extent than when infections were carried out at 37°C to mimic the lower lung environment. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, replication of SARS-CoV was not impacted by different incubation temperatures. The experiments were conducted both in the high security laboratory of the IVI in Mittelhäusern and in the biosafety laboratory of the Institute for Infectious Diseases (IFIK) at the University of Bern in the building of sitem-insel, the Swiss Institute for Translational Medicine and Entrepreneurship.

Temperature also influences the response from the epithelium

The team also analyzed which genes are turned on and off after infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to understand how cells from the human respiratory tract respond to infection and which innate immune programs are activated. The innate immune system is our body's ""first line of defense"" against invading pathogens and is crucial not only to contain the invader, but also to teach other branches of the immune system how to react appropriately.

When mimicking the conditions found in the upper airways (33°C), the team found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 did not stimulate the innate immune response within these cells as strongly as it did when they mimicked conditions found in the lower respiratory tract (37°C). ""Since the strength of the innate immune response can directly influence the degree of viral replication, this may help explain why SARS-CoV-2 replicated more efficiently at lower temperatures"", says Dijkman. Although mounting a strong innate immune response against the virus is generally beneficial, it is important to note that in some cases the innate immune response can become overactivated. This in turn can be detrimental to the infected individual, as high levels of inflammation can also induce tissue damage and accelerate disease progression - a phenomenon that is often seen in patients suffering from severe COVID19.

""The detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 replication and the temperature-induced changes in the host innate immune defense mechanisms helps explain why SARS-CoV-2 replicates so well in the upper respiratory tract, and is perhaps why SARS-CoV-2 exhibits higher human-to-human transmissibility than SARS-CoV"", Dijkman explains.

Important knowledge to fight coronavirus infections

The use of this authentic cell culture model in a controlled laboratory setting proved to accurately reflect the different behavior of two similar viruses in the context of a pandemic. ""This unique system provides insight into the molecular battle that occurs between virus and host during an infection and underscores the importance of subtle changes in the virus-host microenvironment that may impact virus replication and propagation"", says Dijkman. Understanding which key players are involved in this process, and whether they favor the host or virus, opens new opportunities for the establishment of highly targeted intervention strategies and the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds that will help combat coronavirus infections.

Cells and viruses

The different cell lines and primary cells that were used in this study were chosen according to their high sensitivity to replication of a corresponding coronavirus. Human hepatoma Huh7 (JCRB, 0403) cells, human colon Caco-2 cells (ATCC, HTB-37), monkey Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) and monkey kidney BSC-1 cells (ATCC, CCL-26) were maintained in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 U ml−1 penicillin and 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts were developed in-house. Human primary small-airway epithelial cells (ATCC, PCS-301-010) were cultured with airway epithelial cell basal medium, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were differentiated from the human embryonic stem cell HES2 (ESI) maintained in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies)34. In brief, HES2 cells were dissociated with Accutase (Invitrogen) into single-cell suspensions on day 0. Cells were seeded on low-attachment culture vessels (Corning) and cultured in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 40 μg ml−1 Matrigel, 1 ng ml−1 BMP4 (Invitrogen) and 10 μM Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCK) (R&D) under hypoxic environment with 5% O 2 . From day 1 to 3, cells were cultured in StemPro34 SFM (Invitrogen) with 50 μg ml−1 ascorbic acid (AA) (Sigma), 2 mM Gluta-MAX (Invitrogen), 10 ng ml−1 BMP4, and 10 ng ml−1 human recombinant activin-A (Invitrogen). From day 4 to day 7, 5 μM Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (Tocris) was added. From day 8 to day 14, cells were cultured under normoxia in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM Gluta-MAX, 1× B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 50 μg ml−1 AA. The cells were then dissociated with Accutase and seeded as a monolayer in desired culture vessels for 3 days before infections. The SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a strain (GenBank accession number: MT230904) was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen of a patient who was laboratory-confirmed to have COVID-19 in Hong Kong26. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and obtained through BEI Resources. The MERS-CoV strain (HCoV-EMC/2012) was a gift from R. Fouchier. The archived clinical strains of SARS-CoV (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) were obtained from the Department of Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong (HKU)35. All experiments involving live SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 facility at the University of Hong Kong and Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, as was previously described15.

Antiviral evaluation in human ex vivo lung tissues

Human lung tissues for ex vivo studies were obtained from patients who were undergoing surgical operations at Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong), as previously described36. The donors and/or parents of the donor gave written consent, as approved by the Institutional Review Board of the HKU/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW13-364). The freshly obtained lung tissues were processed into small rectangular pieces and were rinsed with advanced DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM of HEPES (Gibco), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco), 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin. The specimens were infected with SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a or MERS-CoV with an inoculum of 1 × 106 PFU ml−1 at 500 μl per well. After 2 h, the inoculum was removed, and the specimens were washed 3 times with PBS. The infected human lung tissues were then cultured in 1 ml of advanced DMEM/F12 medium with 2 mM HEPES (Gibco), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco), 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 20 μg ml−1 vancomycin, 20 μg ml−1 ciprofloxacin, 50 μg ml−1 amikacin and 50 μg ml−1 nystatin. Supernatants were collected at 24 h after inoculation for plaque assays.

Antiviral assessment in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Male and female Syrian hamsters, aged 6–10 weeks old, were obtained from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Laboratory Animal Service Centre through the HKU Centre for Comparative Medicine Research. The hamsters were kept in biosafety level 2 housing and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum, as was previously described26. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee in the HKU (CULATR) and were performed according to the standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 animal facilities (reference code: CULATR 5370-20). Experimentally, each hamster was intranasally inoculated with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in 100 μl PBS under intraperitoneal ketamine (200 mg per kg) and xylazine (10 mg per kg) anaesthesia.

To simulate the prescribed human dosage (200 mg per day), an equivalent hamster dose of 25 mg per kg per day was converted on the basis of body surface area. Specifically, 25 mg per kg (hamster) × 0.13 (conversion factor) = 3.25 mg per kg (human equivalent dose); and a 60-kg human requires 3.25 mg per kg × 60 kg = 195 mg clofazimine per day. Prophylactic treatment used oral administration of clofazimine given 3, 2 and 1 days before infection (25 mg per kg each time), followed by virus challenge at day 0; therapeutic post-exposure and oral administration of clofazimine (Sigma-Aldrich, C8895) was performed on 1, 2 and 3 days after infection (25 mg per kg each time) with the first dosage given at 24 h after inoculation. Clofazimine was delivered using corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich, C8267) as vehicle. Remdesivir was included as a positive-control drug and dosed at 15 mg per kg via the intraperitoneal route on the basis of its effective dosage in SARS-CoV-infected mice10. Remdesivir (15 mg per kg, MedChemExpress) was prepared as 100 mg ml−1 stock in DMSO and further diluted using 12% SBE-β-CD before intraperitoneal injection. Hamsters receiving pure corn oil (oral) and 2% DMSO in 12% SBE-β-CD (intraperitoneal) were used as the vehicle-control group. Hamsters were killed at 4 days after infection for virological and histopathological analyses. Viral yield in the lung tissue homogenates and/or faeces was detected by plaque assay and/or RT–qPCR. Nasal washes were collected to examine virus shedding from the respiratory tract. Hamsters were treated with isoflurane lightly, and then 200 μl of PBS was injected into one nasal opening while turbid wash was collected from the other one without any blood contamination. The nasal wash was filtered through 0.22-μm filters before being subjected to plaque assay. An ELISA kit was used to determine the amount of IL-6 in the hamster sera at 4 days after infection, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (ELISAGenie, HMFI0001). Tissue pathology of infected hamsters was examined by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in accordance with the established protocol37. On day 14 after infection, an enzyme immunoassay was used to determine the antibody titre of hamster sera against SARS-CoV-2 N antigen. In brief, 96-well immune plates (Nunc) were coated with 100 μl per well (0.1 μg per well) of SARS-CoV-2 N in 0.05 M NaHCO 3 (pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking, 100 μl of heat-inactivated serum samples was serial-diluted before being added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached antibodies were detected using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-hamster IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A18895; 1:2,000). The reaction was developed by adding diluted 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine single solution (TMB) (Invitrogen) and stopped with 0.3 N H 2 SO 4 . The optical density was read at 450/620 nm using a microplate reader.

RNA-seq analysis

FASTQ files from RNA-seq were quality-examined by FastQC (v.0.11.7) (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were processed by cutadapt to remove reads with low quality and to trim adapters. For RNA-seq on Caco-2 cells, trimmed reads were aligned to hg38 reference genome and NCBI SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using TopHat38(v.2.1.1); and RNA-seq data from hamster lung tissues were mapped to MesAur1.0 (GCA_000349665.1), downloaded from Ensembl. Reads assigned to each gene were counted by featureCounts39 (v.2.0.1) with human refseq gene sets as references for Caco-2 cells, and gene annotation of golden hamster from Ensembl database for the hamster dataset. Genes without at least 1 read mapped on average in each sample were considered undetectable and were filtered out. Read counts were normalized by the trimmed mean of M-values method and differential expression was calculated using R package edgeR (v.3.28.1) and genewise negative binomial generalized linear models with quasi-likelihood tests method was used for statistical tests. Cut-offs imposed for differential expression analysis were set as a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and fold change >2 or <0.5. The pathway analysis was performed by R package clusterProfiler40 (v.3.14.3) and Metascape41. Heat maps were plotted using R package pheatmap (v.1.0.12) (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap). Other plots were generated by R package ggplot2 (v.3.3.0) (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). PCA analysis was performed by R package factoextra (1.0.7).

Pseudotyping of VSV and pseudotype-based inhibition assay

VSV pseudotyped with the S of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were generated as previously reported, with some modifications42. In brief, BHK-21/WI-2 cells (Kerafast) overexpressing the S were inoculated with VSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-luciferase VSV (Kerafast). After a 2-h inoculation at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and cells were refed with DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC; 1:100). Pseudotyped particles were collected at 24 h after inoculation, then centrifuged at 1,320g to remove cell debris and stored at −80 °C until use.

To determine the effect of the compounds on viral entry, Vero E6 cells were treated with clofazimine at a concentration of 2.5 μM for 1 h before inoculation with respective pseudotyped VSV. After a 2-h inoculation in the presence of the compounds, the inoculum was removed, and cells were refed with fresh medium for further culture. The activity of firefly luciferase was measured using bright-Glo luciferase assay (Promega) for quantitative determination at 16 h after transduction.

The effect of clofazimine on SARS-CoV-2 viral replication

The full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA transcripts were in vitro-synthesized from an infectious clone of SARS-CoV-2 (provided by P.-Y. Shi) according to a recently published protocol43. Ten μg of total RNA transcripts and 5 μg SARS-CoV-2 N gene transcript were mixed with Vero E6 cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 N and then added into a 0.2-cm cuvette for nucleofection with the 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit (Lonza) using pulse code V-001. Immediately after electroporation, 1,000 μl of prewarmed medium was added to the cuvette and cells were subsequently aliquoted into 384-well plates. Two hours after seeding, compounds at different concentrations were added into each well. At 12 h after electroporation, intracellular and viral RNA was purified from the treated cells with TurboCapture 384 mRNA Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA was subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with the following primer (TagRdRp-F: 5′-CGGTCATGGTGGC GAATAACCCTGTGGG TTTTACACTTAA-3′). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The following primers and probe were used for negative-stranded RNA detection: Tag-F: 5′-CGGTCATGGTGGCGAATAACCCTGT-3′, ORF1ab-R: 5′-ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA-3′, ORF1ab-P: 5′-6FAM-CCGTCTGCGGTA TGTGGAAAGGTTATGG -BHQ1-3′). In parallel, 5 μg of the in vitro-transcribed GFP mRNA (StemMACS eGFP mRNA, 130-101-114) was electroporated into Vero E6 cells. At 2 h after seeding, cells were treated either with clofazimine or remdesivir, and then cultured for a further 24 h. The GFP signal was measured by flow cytometry analysis using FlowJo (v.10.0.7).

Detection of S binding against ACE2 or heparin

Binding between the purified SARS-CoV-2 S and the cellular entry factors ACE2 or heparin were detected by ELISA, as was previously described22. High-binding microtitre plates were coated with heparin–BSA (100 ng per well) or recombinant ACE2 (200 ng per well) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then blocked for 3 h at 37 °C with TSM buffer (20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA). Next, 10 nM biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S in a dilution of clofazimine (10–0.1 μM) in TSM buffer was added to the plates in triplicate. Bound biotinylated protein was detected by adding Avidin-HRP (405103, BioLegend) diluted 1:2,000 in TSM buffer. Finally, the plates were developed with TMB turbo substrate for 5–15 min. The reaction was quenched using 1 M sulfuric acid and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

S-mediated membrane fusion assay

SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell–cell fusion assay was performed as was previously established, with some modifications22. Vero cells were cotransfected with 1 μg SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid and 0.4 μg EGFP plasmid for 8 h. In another 24-well plate, Vero cells (that is, target cells expressing ACE2) were washed with PBS before being cocultured with the effector cells (that is, Vero cells cotransfected with S and EGFP), in the presence of the indicated concentration of clofazimine. After another 48 h, S-mediated membrane fusion, as reflected by the green florescence area, was evaluated using confocal imaging. Vero cells transfected with EGFP, without S transfection, were included as a negative control.

Time-of-addition assay

A time-of-drug-addition assay was performed to investigate which stage of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle it is that clofazimine interferes with, as previously described15. In brief, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (4 × 104 cells per well). The cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 at an MOI of 1.5 and then incubated for additional 1 h. The viral inoculum was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. At 1 h after inoculation (that is, after entry), clofazimine at a concentration of 5 μM was added to the infected cells at time points indicated, followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 until 10 h after inoculation (that is, one virus life cycle). Cells were fixed at 10 h after inoculation for the quantification of the percentage of infected cells using an immunofluorescence assay targeting SARS-CoV-2 N.

In vitro primer elongation assay using RdRp core complex

Expression plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 were provided by the laboratory of S. Darst and E. Campbell. The expression and purification of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 were performed as previously described25. The transcription scaffold was prepared by annealing a 2:1:3 molar ratio of template strand RNA (5′-CUAUCCCCAUGUGAU UUUAAUAGCUUCUUAGGAGAAUGACGUAGCAUGCUACGCG), 32P labelled primer RNA (5′-CGCGUAGCAUGCUACGUCAUUCUCCUAAGAAGCUA) and nontemplate DNA (5′-ATCACATGGGGATAG) at 95 °C for 5 min, and a slow cooldown to room temperature in elongation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 5 mM DTT). The prepared scaffold was incubated with different concentrations of clofazimine or SL-11128 for 2 h at room temperature. SL-11128 has previously been reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-215. The RdRp core complex was prepared by mixing a 1:3 molar ratio of nsp12 to nsp7 and nsp 8 and incubating for 20 min in ice. The scaffold was added to the RdRp complex and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. To start the reaction, an equal volume of rNTP was added to the RdRp–scaffold complex. The final concentrations for assays were: 20 nM scaffold, 250 nM RdRp, 5–40 μM of clofazimine or SL-11128 and 10 μM rNTP. The reaction was quenched by mixing with loading buffer (90% formamide, 50 mM EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol and 0.05% bromophenol blue) at different time points. All samples were denatured at 95 °C for 20 min and analysed by 8% TBE and urea denaturing PAGE.

In vitro helicase unwinding assay using nsp13

Helicase inhibition assays were performed as previously described37. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified using the Ni2+-loaded HiTrap Chelating System (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA oligomers FL-Cy3 oligonucleotide (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTC GAGCACCGCTGCGGCTGCACC(Cy3)-3′) and RL-BHQ oligonucleotide (5′-(BHQ2)GGTGCAGCCGCAGCGGTGCTCG-3′) were purchased from Metabion. RNA oligonucleotides, including RNA_31/18-mer-Cy3 (5′-CGCAGUCUUCUCCUGGUGCUCGAAC AGUGAC(Cy3)-3′) and RNA_31/18-mer_BHQ (5′-(BHQ2)GUCACUGUUCGAGCACCA-3′), were synthesized from IDT. Both oligonucleotides were annealed in the buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Assays were performed in buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol and 10 nM helicase, followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of 100 mM ATP and 1.5 μl of oligonucleotide mixture to make the final concentration of FL-Cy3:RL-BHQ oligonucleotide and FL-Cy3:RL oligonucleotide 5 nM and 10 nM, respectively. Fluorescence (λ ex = 550 nm, λ em = 620 nm) was measured using SpectraMax iD3 Multi-Mode microplate reader to determine the extent of DNA–RNA duplex unwinding.
