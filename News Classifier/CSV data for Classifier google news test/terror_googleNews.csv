The bulletin suggests the riot by a mob of Donald Trump supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January may embolden extremists and set the stage for additional attacks.

DHS did not cite any specific plots, but pointed to “a heightened threat environment across the United States” that it believes “will persist” for weeks.

It is not uncommon for the federal government to warn local law enforcement through bulletins about the prospect for violence tied to a particular event or date, such as the Fourth of July holiday. But this particular bulletin, issued through the department’s national terrorism advisory system, is notable because it effectively places the Biden administration into the politically charged debate over how to describe or characterize acts motivated by political ideology and suggests that it sees violence aimed at overturning the election as akin to terrorism.

The wording of the document also suggests that national security officials see a connective thread between recent violence over the last year motivated by anti-government grievances, including Covid-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results and police use of force. It also singles out racially motivated acts of violence such as the 2019 rampage targeting Latinos in El Paso, Texas, as well as the threat posed by extremists motivated by foreign terrorist organizations.

“Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,” the bulletin said.

A DHS statement that accompanied the bulletin noted the potential for violence from “a broad range of ideologically-motivated actors”. It also noted violent riots in “recent days”, an apparent reference to events in Portland, Oregon, linked to anarchist groups.

“The domestic terrorism attack on our Capitol earlier this month shined a light on a threat that has been right in front of our faces for years,” said the congressman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who is the chair of the House homeland security committee. “I am glad to see that DHS fully recognizes the threat posed by violent, rightwing extremists and is taking efforts to communicate that threat to the American people.”"

Using a federal system designed to warn all Americans about terrorist threats to the U.S. homeland, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a warning that anger ""fueled by false narratives,"" especially unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential election, could lead some inside the country to launch attacks in the coming weeks.

""Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,"" according to a bulletin issued Wednesday through the DHS National Terrorist Advisory System -- or NTAS.

The system was last used to issue a public warning a year ago, when DHS issued a bulletin over potential retaliation by Iran for the U.S. assassination of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq days earlier. A year before that, DHS issued a bulletin through the same system to highlight the threat from foreign terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaida.

But over the past year, domestic terrorists ""motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results, and police use of force have plotted and on occasion carried out attacks against government facilities,"" and ""long-standing racial and ethnic tension -- including opposition to immigration -- has driven [domestic terrorist] attacks,"" the bulletin issued Wednesday said.

""DHS is concerned these same drivers to violence will remain through early 2021 and some [domestic terrorists] may be emboldened by the January 6, 2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. to target elected officials and government facilities,"" the bulletin added.

Violent supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol three weeks ago, many of them believing -- based on unfounded claims from Trump himself -- that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from Trump through fraud.

Wednesday's public warning echoes what intelligence bulletins sent privately to law enforcement officials in recent weeks have said, underscoring a continued threat from violence-prone individuals who still believe President Joe Biden's election was illegitimate.

The NTAS system ""recognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation's security, and should always be aware of the heightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do,"" DHS says on its website.

The system was created in 2011, replacing the color-coded alerts that were implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

For these reasons, the incoming Biden administration should reverse the Huthis’ designation as soon as possible upon taking office.
Along with UN and humanitarian officials, Crisis Group has repeatedly raised these concerns with senior U.S. officials.
But the proponents have won the day, having gained the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior Trump administration officials.
If it wants to ward off mass starvation, the Trump administration should immediately take mitigating steps.","yemen, trump, humanitarian, efforts, huthi, officials, terrorist, huthis, reverse, designation, terror, administration, designations",terror,Terrorism,"The outgoing Trump administration has designated Yemen’s Huthi rebels a terrorist organisation. Proponents argue the measure will provide leverage with the Huthis, but in reality it will hurt efforts to end the war and could precipitate famine. The incoming Biden administration should rescind it immediately.

Against the advice of more or less everyone working in the humanitarian, economic and diplomatic fields in Yemen, and including many of its own professional staff, the outgoing Trump administration has designated Yemen’s Ansar Allah, better known at home and abroad as the Huthis, as a terrorist organisation.

The designation (in fact, a package of designations that named the Huthi movement both a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation” and, along with three of its top leaders, a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” entity) will unquestionably make what the UN says is already the world’s largest humanitarian crisis much worse by tipping parts of Yemen into famine. The action is also bad for UN-led efforts to end the war. And it arguably runs counter to U.S. interests and harms the security of Washington’s Gulf allies.

For these reasons, the incoming Biden administration should reverse the Huthis’ designation as soon as possible upon taking office. In the meantime, the Trump administration should state unequivocally what exceptions and licences it has put in place to allow for the continued flow of humanitarian aid into Yemen and expand them to include commercial imports. Without such steps, famine is all but certain to follow.

The debate over the merits and risks of a designation is not new. Proponents of a designation, namely Saudi Arabia and its Yemeni allies along with the United Arab Emirates, have been unable to win the war militarily and contend that fighting will only end when the Huthis, now in the ascendant militarily and confident in their status as de facto rulers of north-western Yemen, have been forced into “behaviour change” by economic and political pressure. They also argue that the designation is warranted because the Huthis fulfil the criteria for it by engaging in indiscriminate attacks upon civilians in Yemen as well as firing rockets and missiles at Saudi Arabia and attacking shipping in the Red Sea. As the most recent example, they cite a missile they claim the movement launched at Aden’s international airport in southern Yemen to target the newly formed Yemeni government that had just arrived there on 30 December. The Huthis deny responsibility for the strike.

Critics of the designation, including Crisis Group, approach the issue from a different angle. They argue, first and foremost, that the designation will impose dire collective punishment on the estimated 20 million people who live in Huthi-controlled areas. Yemen is a poor country in peacetime; in wartime, ordinary people have become too impoverished to pay for basic foodstuffs, leaving them increasingly dependent on extensive humanitarian aid. As detailed below, the designation will send a chill through aid agencies, which will fear running afoul of the U.S., and it could throw international trade with Yemen into a deep freeze. Food will become scarce and costlier, making it too expensive for most people to buy. Critics of the designation also contend that it will contribute little to resolving the conflict. The Huthis are likely to become more bellicose and make up any income they lose from taxing local markets by increasing tariffs on goods, pushing the cost of living to even more unsustainable levels for ordinary Yemenis. They are also likely to rely more heavily on Iran, their main external backer, for economic and political support – an outcome the U.S. says it is determined to avoid.

The Huthis’ ties with Iran are not the only issue where Washington’s actions are likely to prove counterproductive to its stated goals. Huthi officials say they will take “reciprocal” action as the designation’s impact becomes clear. Responses could range from a ban on contact with U.S. nationals to intensified cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia as far as to efforts to halt maritime traffic in the Red Sea. In December 2020, Saudi media outlets reported that a seaborne mine launched by the Huthis had struck a cargo ship in the Red Sea in what some in Riyadh saw as a warning from the Yemeni rebels.

The designation also complicates UN-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and convene political talks about ways to end the war. These efforts were already stalling, and in dire need of a boost from the U.S., as both the Huthis and the government seem resolved to pursue a military victory. The Huthis may now choose to boycott the UN envoy, whom they sporadically accuse of being a tool of U.S. interests. Foreign diplomats are likely to be constrained in their ability to meet the Huthis because of the designations. The Yemeni government, meanwhile, will see in the designation validation of its maximalist demand that the Huthis, in effect, surrender, rather than working to find a middle ground with the rebels. The designation further hampers UN-led efforts to remove an estimated one million barrels of oil from a rusting tanker off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, thus averting ecological disaster, and to decommission the vessel, an operation that will require foreign experts to travel to Sanaa – something that will become more difficult with the designations.

Along with UN and humanitarian officials, Crisis Group has repeatedly raised these concerns with senior U.S. officials. But the proponents have won the day, having gained the support of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior Trump administration officials. Since mid-2020, a group of these officials have come to see a designation as another building block in their “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran and as a source of much-needed leverage with the Huthis for the U.S. and its allies. Internal deliberations over the designation intensified after President Donald Trump lost the November 2020 election, and Pompeo and others sought a final series of political “wins” at home and abroad before leaving office, including the normalisation deals between Israel and Arab states and a final wave of sanctions against perceived U.S. rivals. Congressional insiders in Washington liken the raft of punitive measures unleashed over the course of the administration’s final months to a “minefield” deliberately laid for the incoming Biden administration, which will likely be overwhelmed by the sheer number of politically sensitive measures it is pressed to undo in its early days.

The U.S. officials’ rush to the finish line has had deeply troubling consequences. So eager was the Trump administration to designate the Huthis before leaving office that it announced the move before it had done its due diligence on limiting humanitarian harm. It made the announcement before the Treasury Department had prepared a package of licences that would assure the UN aid agencies and humanitarian NGOs that they could continue their work in Yemen without fear of civil or criminal penalties in the U.S. Treasury officials are now scrambling to complete this package before the designation takes effect on 19 January. Meanwhile, no such licence is being prepared for private-sector importers, meaning that trade inflows may grind to a halt even if the U.S. puts humanitarian waivers in place in time. Senior aid officials say that if food and other imports are frozen, there is little they can do to prevent a famine. In December 2020, the UN warned that 16,500 Yemenis were already in famine-like conditions and that this number would triple by the end of 2021, before accounting for the effects of a designation.

If it wants to ward off mass starvation, the Trump administration should immediately take mitigating steps. It should have the Treasury Department issue an expansive licence package while the Department of Justice should state unequivocally that humanitarian organisations will not be prosecuted for working in Yemen or engaging directly with the Huthis. If it cannot complete the package before the designation comes into force, the designation should be halted. The U.S. should also issue licences for the private sector, or at a minimum give clear public guidance to commercial interests that they will not be prosecuted for trading with merchants in Yemen, who may be subject to taxation, for example, in Huthi-held areas – that is to say, all businesses importing goods into Yemen.

But these measures are merely palliative – and inadequate at that. Never before has the U.S. slapped a terrorist designation on a group like the Huthis that controls this much territory (around 30 per cent of Yemen’s land mass) and administers (at least de facto) so many people (approximately twenty million Yemenis). Even with licences in place, international banks, insurers and commodity traders that grease the wheels of international trade could well conclude that the risk of legal censure in the U.S. outweighs the meagre profits offered by trade with Yemen. The only way to avoid additional impediments to the movement of trade is to lift the blanket designation of the Huthis.

That task will fall to the incoming Biden administration. The new president’s senior advisers may believe there are more pressing issues to attend to, or worry that lifting the designation is too tricky politically, given that the Huthis are a violent armed group with a sectarian outlook that overthrew Yemen’s internationally recognised government. Nonetheless, the administration must lift the movement’s dual Foreign Terrorist Organisation and Specially Designated Global Terrorist designations, preferably in its first days or week. That said, lifting designations can take time, and in the interim the Biden administration should be prepared to issue as expansive a licencing regime as possible and signal to the humanitarian aid community and others its intention to revoke the designations. It is far better to prevent a full-blown famine driven by U.S. actions now, than to deal with the consequences only when they become so evident as to be uncontrollable."

“The most urgent priority in Yemen right now is to prevent a massive famine,” Mark Lowcock will tell a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, according to prepared remarks made available ahead of his briefing.

U.N. data anticipates 16 million people will go hungry in the war-torn country this year. Another 50,000 already live in famine-like conditions, while 5 million more are right behind them.

“Every decision the world makes right now must take this into account,” Lowcock will warn.

Late Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he plans to designate the Iranian-backed rebel group a “Foreign Terrorist Organization,” or FTO, to hold it accountable for acts such as “cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.”

Pompeo said the designation, which takes effect Jan. 19, the last full day of the Trump administration, is “intended to advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united Yemen that is both free from Iranian interference and at peace with its neighbors.”

Yemen imports 90% of its food, nearly all via commercial channels. Suppliers, bankers, shippers and others who fear running afoul of U.S. regulations could cease doing business with Yemeni importers. The U.N. says aid agencies cannot replace the commercial import system.

Food prices, already inflated beyond most people’s means, could skyrocket even higher if the supply chain collapses. Yemenis have begun stockpiling whatever staples they can afford, fearful that imports will come to a halt.

Pompeo said in his statement Sunday that Washington is willing to implement measures to reduce the impact on “certain humanitarian activity and imports” and is ready to work with the U.N. and NGOs to address the implications.

But the U.N. and its partners are not the ones importing most of the food. They say they also have no confirmed details yet on how the licenses or exemptions would work and who or what would be eligible, with just days until the designation goes into effect.

While the U.N.’s Lowcock will not question the intent of the FTO designation, he will call for its reversal, warning that it could result in “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years.”

Some analysts say the incoming Biden administration may not be able to easily undo the designation if it wants to.

“The decision will tie the incoming administration’s hands as it will have to try to reverse the decision, which is not an easy thing to do, or to justify to Congress why it wants to deal with the Houthis despite the designation,” Nabeel Khoury, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said following the U.S. announcement.

“Additionally, the decision feeds into the hands of the hardliners within the Houthi organization and makes it difficult for their leadership to engage in peace talks,” he said.

More than five years of war between the Saudi Arabian-backed government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Iranian-supported Houthi rebels has pushed the Middle East’s poorest country to the brink."

Mumbai attack mastermind jailed over fears of FATF action over terror financing

Just six days after his arrest on January 2, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the known Lashkar-e-Taiba mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes, was sentenced to a five-year jail term on terror financing charges on January 8.

The speed with which the wheels of justice turned in Pakistan in the case of Lahkhvi’s terror financing case are in sharp contrast to the years he remained charged in the Mumbai attack case, in which he was eventually bailed out.

Also read: Ahead of crucial FATF meeting, Pakistan arrests LeT leader Lakhvi

It’s evident that where Indian pressure and American prodding didn’t work in ensuring Lakhvi’s conviction in the Mumbai terror strikes, in which 166 persons were killed, Islamabad’s fears about punitive action from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, seem to have done the trick.

Islamabad has been facing the heat from the financial watchdog for some time on the issue of terror financing and has called upon Pakistan to make sure it complies fully with its action plan prior to a key FATF meeting in February.

Saeed’s conviction

Lakhvi’s sentence is also in line with that of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed’s conviction in four terror-financing cases in November and February 2020. In October 2020, FATF decided that Pakistan would remain on its grey list, pending full compliance with its action plan.

In a statement, FATF said Pakistan needed to work in four areas to address “strategic deficiencies” as far as terror financing was concerned. Among other things, Pakistan needed to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all “[UN-mandated] 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists”.

Also read: U.S. welcomes arrest of 26/11 attack mastermind and LeT commander Lakhvi

So, here we have the context behind all the “action” from the Pakistani establishment relating to Lakhvi and Saeed, who prospered and thrived in the warm embrace of the Pakistani establishment for decades. They are now being treated as a public liability and, hence, the arrests and rather speedy convictions.

Also, key for the Pakistan Army/ intelligence establishment is that their convictions are not in relation to an India-related terrorist case. Bending before India, or being seen to be bending before India, is not good policy for any Pakistani establishment. The fallout of an India-terror related conviction would be a hot potato to handle, given that many key figures in the Pakistani establishment said at the time of the Mumbai terror strikes that these had been conducted by India itself.

Also read: India terms action against Lakhvi a farce

In Lakhvi’s case, the prosecution seems to have had its way with the Lahore anti-terrorism court judge. “The court was informed that Lakhvi was a founding member of the banned LeT, which was proscribed in the country in 2002 due to its involvement in terrorism, while the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) has also imposed financial restrictions on him,” The Express Tribune reported on Friday. The court held that a “dispensary” was under Lashkar’s charge and being used for “terrorist purposes”.

In all, the Dawn newspaper reported that the Pakistani Punjab’s counter-terrorist department had registered 41 FIRs against Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent wing of the Lashkar) leaders, of which trial courts had “decided” as many as 27 cases.

Strategic decision

It’s clear that a strategic decision has been taken to shut down the JuD-Lashkar combine by the Pakistani establishment. However, even during his time as an “under trial” detainee in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, Lakhvi could receive guests and use the Internet, access a mobile phone and watch television. He is even believed to have fathered a child while in jail. So, the jury will have to wait and watch what kind of “jail treatment” awaits Lakhvi this time.

The secrecy with which the Pakistani deep State operates makes it difficult to assess what exactly is happening. A recent arrest warrant for Masood Azhar, leader of the Jaish-e-Muhammad, confirms after years the presence of the wanted terrorist in Pakistan. Remember that Azhar was one of the terrorists exchanged by India in return for the passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight to Kandahar in December 1999. Given their being creatures of the Pakistani establishment, and the enduring interest in using non-State actors to foment trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, it’s quite likely that new outfits may have already received the blessings of the deep State. For now, Lakhvi and Saeed are in jail. Azhar’s fate will be keenly watched in India."

The decision has been expected as one of the State Department’s possible actions in the waning days of the Trump administration, amid its increased pressure on Iran. The designation will take effect Jan. 19, a day before the presidential inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.

In a statement late Sunday, Pompeo said the designation of the Iran-backed Houthis and three of the group’s leaders is intended to hold them accountable for acts such as “cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.”

The United Nations has warned for weeks that such a designation will hurt humanitarian operations. Yemen relies almost completely on imports for its food supply.

“We are concerned that the designation will negatively impact, including through possible ‘over compliance’ by commercial actors, imports of food and other essential commodities just as more Yemenis are starving,” U.N. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday. “The humanitarian operation – the largest in the world - cannot replace the private sector or compensate for major drops in commercial imports of food and other essential goods.”

The U.N. says more than 16 million people – more than half of Yemen’s population -- will be facing crisis levels of food insecurity by the middle of this year. A further 3.6 million are on the brink of famine, and that could rise to 5 million by June.

“The growing risk of famine in Yemen underlines the imperative for the U.S. to swiftly grant the necessary licenses and exemptions to ensure that principled humanitarian assistance can continue to reach all people who need it across the country without disruption,” Dujarric added.

Pompeo said in his statement that the United Sates is ready to implement measures to reduce the designation’s impact on “certain humanitarian activity and imports” into Yemen and is ready to work with the U.N. and NGOs to address the implications.

The U.N. also expressed concern that the U.S. move could hurt its efforts to negotiate a resumption of the political process and further polarize the parties.

“Notwithstanding possible political repercussions, we will continue to work with all parties to resume and continue an inclusive political process to reach a comprehensive negotiated settlement to end the conflict,” the U.N.’s Dujarric said.

More than five years of war between the Saudi Arabian-backed government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the Tehran-supported Houthi rebels has pushed the country into chronic state of crisis.

In a separate development, Pompeo spoke at Voice of America’s headquarters in Washington on Monday, taking questions on camera for the first time since a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump overran the Capitol last week as lawmakers were certifying Biden’s presidential victory.

Last week on Twitter, the secretary wrote that, “In the United States, law enforcement officials quash mob violence so that the people’s representatives can exercise power in accordance with the rule of law and constitutional government.”

In a highly unusual move, American diplomats drafted two cables condemning Trump's incitement of the deadly assault on the Capitol and calling for administration officials to support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.

Using what is known as the State Department's ""dissent channel,"" the career foreign service officers said they fear last Wednesday's siege may badly undermine U.S. credibility to promote and defend democratic values abroad.

The cables also reflect anger at the response to the riot by Secretary of State Pompeo.

On Friday, Pompeo met for the first time with Antony Blinken, President-elect Biden’s nominee to be his successor at the State Department."

“We welcome Pakistan’s arrest of terrorist leader Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi as an important step in holding him responsible for his role in supporting terrorism and its financing,” the US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs said on Twitter.

“We will follow his prosecution & sentencing closely & urge that he be held accountable for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks,” it said.

Lakhvi, one of the alleged masterminds of the Mumbai attacks, was arrested by Pakistani authorities on January 2 on charges of involvement in terror financing, almost five years after he was freed on bail.

His whereabouts had not been known since he was released on bail from a jail in Rawalpindi in April 2015. However, it was widely believed he had continued playing a key role in directing the activities of LeT even while he was in prison after being arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage.

Six US citizens were among the 166 people killed when a 10-member LeT team attacked Mumbai in November 2008.

A spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan’s Punjab province said in a statement that Lakhvi was arrested on charges of terrorism financing during an intelligence-based operation.

“He is accused of running a dispensary [and] using funds collected for terrorism financing. He [and] others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the spokesman said.

Lakhvi, who is also a UN-designated terrorist, will face trial in an anti-terrorism court in Lahore, the spokesperson said.

Last year, LeT founder Hafiz Saeed was convicted in five separate cases of terror financing and given a jail term ranging from five years to fifteen-and-half years. These sentences will run concurrently.

Lakhvi’s arrest came weeks ahead of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) planned reassessment of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing. In October last year, the multilateral watchdog retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, and gave the country time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”."

Khairi Saadallah, a Libyan refugee, pleaded guilty to three counts of murder after killing James Furlong, David Wails and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett in Forbury Gardens on 20 June last year.

Saadallah ""executed"" each man with a single knife blow to the back of the head in the space of less than 30 seconds, the Old Bailey heard.

The 26-year-old also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were injured in the attack.

He was released from HMP Bullingdon two weeks before his attack after serving a 17-month sentence for affray and assault by beating an emergency worker, reduced on appeal.

The day before his release he was notified that the home secretary ""has decided that your deportation is conducive to the public good"" - but a legal barrier prevented this from happening.

Speaking on behalf of James Furlong's family, Gary Furlong said ""serious questions need to be answered"" about how Saadallah was in a position to perform these attacks.

The brother of David Wails added: ""We know that our lives, and the lives of everyone who knew and loved David, will never be the same. We love you David - may you, James and Joe now rest in peace.""

Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's brother-in-law said: ""Unfortunately, no amount of justice will ever bring back Joe, James and David the lives they deserved. And never will it allow family members, loved ones, friends, and those who witnessed the attacks to forget 20 June 2020.""

Several witnesses reported Saadallah yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" and a Muslim bystander heard him say in Arabic: ""God accept my jihad.""

After his arrest, he told police: ""Those men I killed were wrong 'uns, they deserved it. I'm going to paradise for the jihad what I did to them.""

Police later found images of the Twin Towers and the IS flag cached from websites he had visited on his phone, along with links to YouTube videos about the IS executioner Jihadi John.

However, Saadallah later attempted to fake mental illness and in court and denied that he had acted from a religious motive. His lawyer denied he was a terrorist, without suggesting what his motive may have been.

In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Sweeney said he was sure that Saadallah had been trained to fight for the extremist group Ansar al Sharia in Libya - and had lied about his role in the group when he applied for asylum in the UK.

The judge said the knife Saadallah bought for the attack ""was chosen with care to ensure the maximum likelihood of swift fatal injury each time it was used"".

Mr Justice Sweeney also concluded that Saadallah intended to kill as many people as possible, and had planned to injure himself with a plastic razor ""in the hope that he could pass himself off as a victim"".

Saadallah, who showed no emotion as he was sentenced, was told this was ""a rare and exceptional case in which just punishment requires that you must be kept in prison for the rest of your life"".

Saadallah has amassed seven previous convictions for 19 offences, leading to four prison sentences.

During one prison sentence, he had come under the influence of a notorious radical preacher called Omar Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen.

Saadallah came to the notice of MI5, which was told he was planning to travel to Syria, leading to his subsequent referral to the Prevent de-radicalisation programme.

Just 10 days after leaving prison in June last year, Saadallah searched online for ""Is corona a sign of the end of the world?"" and looked at images of people sitting around Forbury Gardens, where he would later launch his attack.

He appeared to have a psychotic episode on 18 June, speaking to mental health services about things under his bed and his belief that he was possessed.

The following day, he bought a large kitchen knife from a supermarket to be used in the attack.

Saadallah's brother later called police to say he was concerned, but officers who visited his address that evening found he was behaving normally.

The next day, Saadallah launched his ""brutal attack"" as the victims enjoyed a ""summer's evening in the park"", prosecutor Alison Morgan QC said.

""In less than a minute, shouting the words 'Allahu Akbar' [God is the greatest] the defendant carried out a lethal attack with a knife, killing all three men before they had a chance to respond and try to defend themselves,"" she said.

Within the same minute, the killer went on to attack others nearby and stabbed Mr Young, Mr Edwards and Mr Nisudan - causing them significant injuries.

Ms Morgan said Saadallah was ""ruthlessly efficient in his actions"", adding: ""The force with which the defendant struck his first victims is clear.

""In short, he executed Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, David Wails and James Furlong with such speed and precision before they had time to be aware of what was happening.

""The defendant believed that in carrying out this attack he was acting in pursuit of his extremist ideology... he believed that in killing as many people as possible that day he was performing an act of religious jihad.""

After the attack, Saadallah ran off and he was pursued by an off-duty police officer. As he was detained, a Muslim member of the public told Saadallah: ""You have nothing to do with Islam, b******."""

Asylum seeker Khairi Saadallah, 26, avoided deportation from the UK for more than seven years as he steadily racked up violent convictions before committing the atrocity last summer.

He knifed history teacher James Furlong, 36, scientist David Wails, 49, and their friend Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, to death in the 'ruthlessly efficient' attack lasting less than a minute.

James Furlong's father Gary Furlong made a statement outside the Old Bailey, London, today

Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan were also stabbed in the attack in Reading on June 20 last year but survived.

Speaking after Saadallah was handed a whole life order at the Old Bailey, James' father Gary Furlong said: 'On the facts of this case, there are now serious questions that need answering, most notably, how the killer was ever in a position to commit these horrific acts.

'Seeking asylum here in 2012 he has obtained a litany of criminal convictions, including assaults on the public, police, and emergency services, along with carrying a bladed weapon.

Mr Furlong said: 'On the facts of this case, there are now serious questions that need answering, most notably, how the killer was ever in a position to commit these horrific acts'

'Whilst in prison it was decided by the Secretary of State on June, 4 2020, just two weeks prior to the attack, that his deportation was in the public interest but for legal reasons it could not happen.

'Despite his criminal history and threats made before the attack, he was then released back into society immediately and was freely able to commit this horrendous act on the public.'

On the sentence handed down by Mr Justice Sweeney on Monday, he said: 'We as a family welcome the whole life order sentence given. No other outcome would have been acceptable to us.

Dr David Wails' brother Andrew also made a statement outside the Old Bailey, London, today

'We'd like to thank the prosecution and investigation team, along with the judge for ensuring justice has been given to James, Joe, and David's killer and also for the other victims who were injured that day.

'The past six months have been extremely difficult for our family and we are especially grateful for the support we've received in particular from our police family liaison officers.

'We'd like to thank James' friends, family as well as work colleagues and pupils from the whole school who have been a great comfort throughout.

'We would also like to thank the public and emergency services that were there that evening to try and help, their lives now impacted by the events.'

He added: 'James was a wonderful man and we now have to focus on all the good things about James's life. Thank you.'

Khairi Saadallah, 26, shouted 'Allahu akhbar' as he fatally stabbed three friends in June 2020

The jihadist killer targeted the victims as they enjoyed the sunshine at Forbury Gardens after the first Covid lockdown restrictions were eased.

His deadly rampage was likened to a game of 'duck, duck goose' by a witness as he ran around trying to kill 'as many people as he could,' the Old Bailey heard.

Saadallah served as a 'proud' soldier of Libyan terror cult Ansar Al Sharia during the country's civil war before fleeing Tripoli for the UK in 2012.

Asylum seeker Khairi Saadallah, 26, avoided deportation from the UK for more than seven years as he steadily racked up violent convictions before committing the atrocity last summer

He was known to the Home Office as a violent offender and was freed from HMP Bullingdon, where he befriended notorious hate preacher Omar Brooks, 15 days before the murders.

On June 4 he had received a letter from the Secretary of State stating he would be deported for 'the public good.'

Saadallah then set about plotting his murderous spree, carrying out reconnaissance on the park and buying a Huawei phone in addition to his probation handset.

Data recovered from the device after the atrocity showed he had been using it to browse YouTube videos of Jihadi John and search the internet for information about extremist ideology.

Images accessed through Facebook also revealed him posing in military fatigues and flaunting guns while he fought in the civil war.

Saadallah admitted murder and attempted murder but submitted a basis of plea, denying he had been motivated by extremist beliefs or put significant planning into the attack.

But after a two-day hearing held to determine the facts, his claims were rejected by Mr Justice Sweeney today, who ruled he had been 'advancing' his terrorist cause.

The terrorist sat in the dock today and remained stony faced as he was handed three life sentences as well as 24 years for the attempted murders.

He wore a traditional kufi and a navy top as the sentence was passed.

After his brother voiced concerns about his well-being, police went to check up on him at his home in Basingstoke Road on June 19, a day before the murders.

Chilling footage shows the killer greeting police and asking: 'I'm not in trouble am I?' while he hid the murder weapon. The officer replied 'No.'

Striking up a friendly conversation during the home visit, an officer can be heard asking: 'What's up lad?' while the killer stood in front of a bag.

Bodyworn cameras caught Saadallah moving towards a corner of the room and standing in front of the bag which contained the knife as they chatted with him.

Police released footage showing Saadallah dismissing officers' concerns about his mental state.

Within hours of the check-up, he had left home for the park, 'strolling normally' and appearing 'placid and polite' until he unleashed the deadly violence.

Wearing a Union Jack bandana tied around his left knee on his way to carry out the atrocity, he passed by a woman in a wheelchair who he handed a Holy Bible.

James Furlong (left), 36, and David Wails (right), 49, were two of the victims in the attack

Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, was also fatally stabbed in the attack on June 20 last year

Neighbour Charmaine Harper remarked on the killer's relaxed disposition in the moments leading up to the killings as he gave her the religious texts in the doorway of the estate.

Victim's mother pays tribute to 'wonderful, caring, loving son' In a victim impact statement read to the court during Saadallah's sentencing hearing last week Mr Wails' mother Joan paid tribute to her 'wonderful, caring, loving son.' The mum said: 'I don't know where to start to explain how I feel about the brutal killing of my wonderful, caring, loving son David and how this has affected me. 'I am an extremely private person sharing my feelings I find very hard to do, however I want to do this for David. 'David was my firstborn and would have been celebrating his 50th birthday this year if he had not been so brutally taken. We never got to see him and celebrate that special time with him. 'There are no certainties in life, that I understand, however you always expect that you will go before your child and when this doesn't happen it is such a heart wrench. 'There is no sense in David's death, it was cruel, inhumane and cowardly. The shock horror and grief of hearing that my son David's and his two friends had been killed with stay with me for the rest of my life. 'What this person did to David and his two friends is monstrous. That's what my family and I refer to as a monster. We don't use his name, he is not deserving of it. 'He is a coward, he is not human. He is an evil murderer who has cowardly taken the life of my son and his friends.' Beloved Mr Wails' brother Andrew described in his statement how he frantically called the morning after the attack when their mother hadn't heard from David for their weekly catch-up. 'My brother was stabbed to death whilst peacefully going about this own business sitting in the park with his friends. All he was doing was enjoying some time with his friends on a sunny evening causing no one any harm and then he was brutally killed,' Andrew said. 'When it was confirmed by that police that David had been killed, that was the moment that my life was never and will never be the same again. 'The rage and hatred I feel towards the coward who did this coward that this to David is indescribable.' Mr Wails' sister Anne Rogers was unaware of the incident until her brother called her the following morning with the tragic news. 'I was utterly heartbroken and devastated when I found out about my brother,' Anne said. 'David was a kind, loving and very gentle person and just went about his business and kept himself to himself. 'It would have been hard enough if we had lost him to an illness or disease or even an accident, but to have lost him so suddenly in such a horrific and senseless way makes it even harder to accept. 'David was only 49 and had so much more to do. When my brother Andrew told me that David had been stabbed and was dead, I couldn't begin to comprehend what had happened. 'It was possibly the worst moment of my life.' Mr Richie-Bennett's relatives read their victim impact statements via video-link from the US. His mother Charlene Ritchie said her son moved to the UK to be with his husband Ian Bennett before losing him to cancer in 2014. Mrs Ritchie said her kind son 'always saw the good in people' and his murder 'devastated' his friends and family. Addressing the killer, she said: 'I cannot and will not call you by name as you are nothing but a failure, your entire life, and I guess your actions that made you feel powerful without thinking of the people who would lose their loved ones so tragically.' Mr Ritchie's father Robert said: 'These senseless murders have caused me and my family extreme sorrow and overwhelming sadness. There have been days when I cannot function normally grieving the loss of Joe, David and James. 'This Christmas Joe was coming to Philadelphia for a family holiday. We will be visiting Joe's grave this Christmas and every Christmas Eve because of the murderous acts of this defendant.' Mr Ritchie's brother, also named Robert, said his brother, who would have turned 40 this January, had dreams of climbing mount Kilimanjaro and travel to Greece and Tasmania for his birthday. 'He was a little disappointed that he would not be able to do all three because of the restrictions placed upon us by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, he said he had the rest of his life to do these things. 'Little did he know a terrorist was going to take his life from him, denying him a chance to achieve his dreams,' he said. Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, QPM, head of CTPSE, said: 'Saadallah is a committed jihadist and was intent on killing as many people as he could on that sunny summer's evening in June. 'As the evidence has shown, Saadallah planned this attack in meticulous detail. The men he killed were not just murdered, they were executed at such a speed, they had very little chance to react or defend themselves. 'The horrors of this incident took just a single minute to unfold. It took him less than 10 seconds to kill three innocent men, and he then went on to attack and tried to kill another three men before running off towards the town centre. 'In that tiny timeframe, he changed the lives of all those involved forever. 'He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed. 'The scene for other people in the busy park at the time of this incident was horrendous and I must pay tribute to the many people who assisted with giving first aid and who have subsequently provided important evidence as part of our investigation. 'The details heard during this hearing will undoubtedly have been distressing for the families of the victims and survivors and I extend my sincere thanks to each and every one of them for their unwavering support throughout this investigation. 'The investigation was led by a specialist team of investigators; police officers and police staff from CTPSE. The sentence passed today is testament to their tenacity in investigating this extremely complex case.' Advertisement

Harrowing witness statements described how one of the victims dropped to the floor 'like a tree being felled' and others were slashed in their neck and face.

Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC, reading from the first-hand accounts in court, said: 'Roger Smith recalls… 'Joe just going over sideways. Like a tree being felled… It all happened really quickly.

'It was like some weird dream I suppose. It was only Ionut pulling on my arm that kind of woke me back up again. I just can't recall the detail.'

'Ionut Paraschiv, also in [the first group], first noticed the defendant walking along the path uttering words, possibly in a foreign language.

'The defendant then suddenly rushed towards Joseph, and appeared to pat him on the shoulder.

'He then did the same to James and then moved to Stephen who raised his arms to protect his face.

'It was at that point, he noticed the male was holding a knife so he shouted 'Knife, knife, run, he has a knife'. He saw Stephen run away bleeding from his head.

'He describes the knife as a 'like a Swiss army knife.' Although he does not remember how and when David Wails was assaulted, he recalls seeing 'blood pumping out from Joe's back'.

'Ionut saw the defendant run towards another group (Group 2) and then out of the park.

'Oliver Seaman was resting at the time of the attack. He woke when he became aware of someone behind James, Stephen and David, moving quickly like a game of 'duck duck goose'... tapping their shoulders.'

Another witness, Lawrence Wort, detailed how Saadallah 'locked eyes' with him and appeared to be on drugs because of his dark pupils.

Saadallah was seen running up to victims and 'hugging' them from behind while stabbing them in the neck.

Horrific CCTV footage from a nearby churchyard shows him charging at the groups of park-goers before running out of the park and disposing of the knife.

In a craven bid to 'blend in with the crowd' of people he had just stabbed, Saadallah cut his own arm with a razor blade before he was spotted and chased by a group of brave witnesses.

Heroic members of the public, including an off-duty policeman who saw the attack, pursued the killer through central Reading before he was tackled to the ground by officers.

Ms Morgan said: 'Saadallah inflicted the wound on his arm either to make it look like he was self-harming to justify his actions or to disguise himself as a victim.

'He picked up a razor from the area where his backpack was on the ground. He then made a cutting motion against his own arm,' Ms Morgan said.

'This must have been for one of two reasons: either to try to create an injury which might allow him to blend into the crowd; or to create a 'self-harm' injury that he would use to try and justify his actions in due course.

'He then walked off towards the centre of Reading, and he broke into a run as he realised that people who had been in the park and who acted and continued to act with conspicuous bravery began to follow the defendant.'

Saadallah told officers: 'I killed those c**ts, what are you waiting for?' after his arrest, the court heard.

In vile comments made to police after he was taken to the station, Saadallah called the murder victims 'wronguns' and said they 'deserved' to die.

After initially pretending to have been targeted in a robbery, the terrorist made a series of chilling remarks when he was in custody.

Despite having been deemed mentally fit for questioning, Saadallah barked 'like a dog' and started doing press-ups in front of officers before admitting the attack during his interview.

Boasting that he believed he was going to 'paradise' for the killings, Saadallah paced his cell repeatedly announcing that he was going to plead guilty while police outside took note.

He refused to sign the comments on record unless he was given a cigarette and instead began shouting about 'magic' in a desperate bid to appear 'mad,' the court heard.

But psychiatrists who assessed him at Belmarsh Prison confirmed there were no signs of a major mental illness.

He later made the following unsolicited comments: 'Tell them I want to plead guilty to the jihad that I done and go to court tomorrow.'

Ms Morgan added: 'On June 23, 2020, from 10.23am to 11.01am, he was interviewed and howled like a dog, did press ups and made random comments in response to questions such as 'I got dropped off into Friar street by a bussy. He had two wings and dropped me off with a magic stick.'

'The Prosecution alleges that the defendant was deliberately and disingenuously seeking to suggest mental disorder at the time of the interviews.'

The panic of the aftermath was captured in a 999 call made by a terrified park-goer in the moments after the attack.

In the recording played to the court the witness said: 'People have been stabbed in Forbury Gardens.'

Asked how many people had been attacked he said: 'I don't know, dozens. We need an ambulance here. All the ambulances you can get. We're following him.

'Just get police here... Just do it now.'

'10 people have been stabbed?' the operator asked.

'More, more maybe,' replied the witness.

An anonymous Muslim witness, Mr V, was caught on bodyworn camera telling the triple killer: 'You have nothing to do with Islam' before telling police: 'I'm livid.'

Mr V said: 'Seriously, I am a Muslim, I have every right... For a p***k like this to say 'Allah akbar...' I'm just livid. I've lived in Reading all my life and I've never seen something like this.'

During the trial of issue before sentence, Rossano Scamardella QC, defending, argued the prosecution had 'demonised everything done' by the triple murderer in the run-up to the killings.

He said Saadallah's actions should be viewed in a different context, and asked the court to consider the fact that he was aged just 15 when he took part in the 2011 Libyan civil war.

He is said to have indulged in cigarettes, cannabis and alcohol, all of which go against the Muslim faith.

Saadallah's carrying of a Bible before the attack and a tattoo of a crucifix on his legs indicated an interest in religions outside of Islam, Mr Scamardella said.

'No radical Muslim would countenance the dogma of another faith. It is inconceivable,' said the barrister.

The barrister argued that wearing gloves at the height of summer, as Saadallah did on the day of the murders to cover his tracks, was 'bizarre and unusual' but not a sure sign of premeditation.

Nor was the purchase of a knife prior to the murders, argued the defence lawyer.

Saadallah was 'intent on killing as many people as he could', say police Following sentencing, Thames Valley Police Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: 'Saadallah is a committed jihadist and was intent on killing as many people as he could on that sunny summer's evening in June. 'As the evidence has shown, Saadallah planned this attack in meticulous detail. The men he killed were not just murdered, they were executed at such a speed, they had very little chance to react or defend themselves. 'The horrors of this incident took just a single minute to unfold. It took him less than 10 seconds to kill three innocent men, and he then went on to attack and tried to kill another three men before running off towards the town centre. 'In that tiny timeframe, he changed the lives of all those involved forever. 'He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. 'I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed.' Advertisement

'We concede there is evidence that the defendant took certain steps to facilitate the killing, putting himself in a position to commit the attack but nothing even close to the amount of planning that does justify a whole life term.

'If buying a knife was evidence of significant planning then any murder by stabbing would involve a whole life term.'

But Justice Sweeney ruled today the atrocity had been both carefully planned and fuelled by deeply held extremist beliefs.

Passing sentence the judge said: 'Having jettisoned the knife he got away from the scene but he was followed and arrested.

'The two groups were each doing no more than sitting in the gardens a focal point in reading since the 18th century enjoying being able to be together after lockdown restrictions when without warning the defendant attacked and murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, each with a single thrust of the knife.

'His attack on them was so swift, ruthless and brutal that none of them had a chance to react let alone defend themselves.

'It was only because of the loss of the element of surprise that his attempts to murder Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan failed.

'The statements speak volumes of the love and esteem in which they were and always will be held by their respective families, friends and professional colleagues and associates and for the devastating consequences of each for their loss.

'The defendant has declined to give or to call evidence and has made clear he no longer relies on the evidence of the defence psychiatrist.

The judge said Saadallah had held extremist beliefs and 'continued to do so alone it with lapses for example in relation to drink and drugs up to and including the events on June 20, 2020.'

'As of his release on June 5 he planned the attack.

'The clothing he wore was intended to blend in with others in the gardens so as to achieve maximum surprise when the attack was launched.

Police tents pictured at Forbury Gardens in Reading after the attack in June last year

'His intention for the purpose of advancing his extremist Islamic cause was to kill as many people as possible.

'As planned, he cut himself with the razor and endeavoured to make off. The seriousness of the murders [is] exceptionally high.

'I have concluded that on each of counts one to three the appropriate starting point is a whole life order.

A statement by Gary Furlong, James Furlong's father In a powerful statement Gary Furlong, James Furlong's father, questioned why the killer had been in a position to commit the atrocity after years of offending. Mr Furlong said: 'We as a family welcome the whole life order. No other outcome would have been acceptable keep to us. 'The past six months have been extremely difficult for our family.' Mr Furlong asked 'how the killer was ever in a position to commit these horrific acts' after 'a litany of convictions including assault... and carrying bladed weapon.' He added: 'While in prison it was decided just two weeks prior to the attack his deportation was in the public interest which for legal reasons could not happen. 'He was then released into society freely and was able to commit this horrendous attack on the public.' Advertisement

'I am sure that the defendant was not suffering from a mental disorder that reduced his culpability for any of the offences.

'It is clear the defendant did not and does not have any major mental illness.

'To the extent that aspects of the defendant's behaviour on 18 and 19 June caused concern to others they were the product of drug consumption had resolved by the 19 and played no part in the events of 20.

'I am sure that during his police interviews he made crude attempts to portray himself as mad at the material time.

'It is aggravating that the defendant has six previous convictions racially aggravated harassment eight for offences of violence and two for the possession of a knife or bladed article.

'There can be no discount for plea in counts one to three.

'There are no mitigating features but that the defendant is entitled to discount for his guilty pleas in counts four to six (attempted murder).

'All six offences had a terrorist connection in consequence of which and academic the defendant will be subject to notification requirements for a period of 30 years.

'Having no doubt that this is a rare and exceptional case in which just punishment requires you be kept in prison for the rest of your life, also [you will be sentenced to] a whole life order.'

Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, Head of CTPSE, said: 'The horrors of this incident took just a single minute to unfold.

'In that tiny time frame he changed the lives of those involved forever. He is a committed jihadist and as was heard in court he planned this attack in meticulous detail.'

The officer said Saadallah had targeted innocent victims 'relaxing and... socialising with friends on a Saturday evening' and that the atrocity would have 'lasting effects' for anyone at the scene.

She thanked witnesses who gave first aid at the scene and the victims' families and friends for their 'unwavering support' in assisting the investigation.

Andrew, Dr Wails' brother, thanked police for their support and members of the public who helped in the 'aftermath' of the attack.

He added: 'As a family it's been devastating to lose our son brother and uncle. We love you David. May you, James and Joe now rest in peace.'

Mr Ritchie-Bennett's family remembered his 'vibrant' life which had been 'cut short' by the terrorist.

They thanked 'every police officer involved in the case' and those who had helped in the moments after the atrocity.

Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road, Reading, admitted three counts of murder and three of attempted murder.

He was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences for the murders and 24 years imprisonment for the attempted murders.

The sentence means he will never be eligible for parole and will spend his life behind bars."

A terrorist who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life sentence.

Khairi Saadallah, 26, shouted “Allahu akhbar” as he attacked friends James Furlong, 36, Dr David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, killing all three.

Saadallah launched the ""swift, ruthless"" knife attack as the group were sitting in Forbury Gardens on June 20 last year, a court heard.

Three other people – Stephen Young, 51, Patrick Edwards, 29, and Nishit Nisudan, 34 – were also injured.

Following the attack, Saadallah threw away his eight-inch blade and ran as an off-duty police officer tried to catch him.

As he was detained, a Muslim member of the public told him: “You have nothing to do with Islam, bastard.""

Saadsallah, a failed Libyan asylum seeker, pleaded guilty to three murders and three attempted murders.

Judge Mr Justice Sweeney sentenced him to a whole-life order, saying it was a “rare and exceptional” case.

The victims were each killed with a single thrust of the knife with the attack lasting less than a minute, the court heard.

“His attack on them was so swift, ruthless and brutal that none of them had any chance to react, let alone to defend themselves,"" the judge said.

“Using his combat experience in each of their cases the defendant targeted a vulnerable area where a single thrust of the knife would, as he intended, inevitably cause death.”

The judge said the defendant had done substantial planning.

He added: “During the course of the attack and afterwards and because he was seeking to advance a political, religious or ideological cause, the defendant was shouting in Arabic, ‘God is the greatest’ and ‘God accept my jihad’.”

He rejected the argument that Saadallah was suffering a mental illness at the time of the killings.

Handing him a whole-life order, Mr Justice Sweeney told the defendant ""you must be kept in prison for the rest of your life.”

Speaking outside court, Mr Furlong’s father Gary welcomed the whole life sentence but said there were “serious questions” over why Saadallah was free to kill having obtained a “litany” of convictions for violence since seeking asylum in 2012.

He said: “Whilst in prison it was decided by the Secretary of State on June, 4 2020, just two weeks prior to the attack, that his deportation was in the public interest but for legal reasons it could not happen.

“Despite his criminal history and threats made before the attack, he was then released back into society immediately and was freely able to commit this horrendous act on the public.”

Mr Ritchie-Bennett’s brother in law Stephen Bennett said: “Unfortunately, no amount of justice will ever bring back Joe, James and David the lives they deserve.

“And never will it allow family members, loved ones, friends and those who witnessed the attacks to forget 20th June 2020.”

He was also sentenced to concurrent 24-year jail terms for each count of attempted murder."

An official from Pakistan's counterterrorism authority, Shakil Ahmed, said that Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was intercepted in the eastern city of Lahore on charges of financing terrorism.

Lakhvi is the purported leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) jihadist organization that was blamed for the Mumbai attacks, which took place across fours days in November 2008. The militant group is accused of carrying out 12 coordinated shootings and bombings that resulted in the deaths of more than 160 people, with hundreds more wounded.

A front for funding terror

Pakistani authorities accuse Lakhvi of running a dispensary in Lahore as a cover for financing terrorism.

Lakhvi was a prominent figure in Hafiz Saeed's charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which is believed to be a front for LeT. Radical cleric Saeed is a designated terrorist in the United States, where there's a $10-million (€8.24-million) bounty on his head. He is currently serving multiple jail terms in Pakistan after being convicted in several cases in recent months.

Saeed has denied any involvement in the Mumbai attacks and insists his organization — which runs schools, seminaries, hospitals and ambulance services — has no links to terrorism.

The Mumbai attacks increased long-held tensions between India and Pakistan.

The two countries have fought two wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 and relations between the pair have been defined by the violent partition of British India — which started the Kashmir conflict — ever since.

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen The last 'German Khar' Ghulam Mohiuddin is in his late 70s, but he still works every day in his small workshop in Srinagar's Rainawari district, producing and repairing small hospital tools made of iron. Through years of practice, he can make replicas of many small tools used in hospitals.

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen A unique set of skills During the reign of Maharaja Hari Singh when Kashmir was a kingdom in the 1940s, Germans manufactured medical equipment. Mohiuddin's family members could repair the German-made equipment perfectly, and impressed German craftsmen at the time. Singh named the craftsmen German Khars (blacksmiths) for their expertise in repairing the equipment, which no one else could do in Kashmir.

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen Hand-made hospital tools Mohiuddin is seen here making a pair of forceps by hand. It will take him a week to produce and should fetch around €40 ($49). This tool will be used during surgery at a hospital in India-administered Kashmir's largest city, Srinagar.

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen Tools that save lives Mohiuddin says despite earning little money, he continues to work on his craft to help people. ""I make this equipment because its saves lives, otherwise I would have left the work,"" he said, adding he has tried to hire helpers, but they are not patient enough for the craft.

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen 'Thorough and precise' In the 1940s, a German hospital administrator in Srinigar wrote a letter to Mohiuddin's father, praising the work as ""so perfect that one cannot tell which is real and which is the replica. His work is extremely thorough and precise.""

Meet the last of Kashmir's 'German Khar' craftsmen Who will continue the work? Mohiuddin and his brothers learned the craft from their father and grandfather. Today, he is the last of his seven brothers who still works as a craftsman, and he fears no one will continue the work when is he gone. Producing replicas of hospital tools is hard work that requires a lot of skill and patience for little pay. ""It is my passion to keep doing this work,"" he said. Author: Rifat Fareed (Srinagar)

In 2011, he was sentenced 15 years in prison for funding a training camp for terrorists in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh.
""He has served his punishment well and followed all rules and procedures,"" Mr Imam was quoted as saying by Antara.
Bashir was the alleged mastermind of Indonesia's deadliest terrorist attack - the 2002 bombings in resort island of Bali which killed 202 people.
Separately, Indonesia's National Police spokesman Ahmad Ramadhan told reporters that the police would ensure security and order on the day of Bashir's release.","bakar, convict, terrorists, indonesias, released, abu, terrorist, prison, release, prisoners, set, bashir, served, week",terror,Terrorism,"JAKARTA - Indonesia's top terrorist convict Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of South-east Asia's terror group Jemaah Islamiah, is set to be released from prison on Friday (Jan 8), Indonesian authorities said on Monday.

The 82-year-old radical cleric has been in jail since his arrest in 2009.

In 2011, he was sentenced 15 years in prison for funding a training camp for terrorists in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh.

The head of West Java's law and human rights regional office, Mr Imam Suyudi, said that Bashir would be released from Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor on Friday after fulfilling his 15-year jail sentence, reduced by 55 months on good behaviour.

""He has served his punishment well and followed all rules and procedures,"" Mr Imam was quoted as saying by Antara.

He also noted that Bashir is ""in good shape"" ahead of his release.

Bashir's lawyer team had last year requested that the government prioritise him for early release along with other prisoners on fears of a potential coronavirus outbreak in prisons, citing his old age as a factor.

Last April, Indonesia set free 30,000 prisoners who had served two-thirds of their sentences, in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in its overcrowded prisons.

Bashir was the alleged mastermind of Indonesia's deadliest terrorist attack - the 2002 bombings in resort island of Bali which killed 202 people. He was never convicted for the attack.

In December 2018, the Indonesian cleric was offered early release on humanitarian grounds by the government due to his deteriorating health.

However, it was conditional that he must first pledge allegiance to the Republic of Indonesia and the state ideology Pancasila, as required of all reformed terrorists. Bashir refused the offer.

Separately, Indonesia's National Police spokesman Ahmad Ramadhan told reporters that the police would ensure security and order on the day of Bashir's release.

He added that it would also monitor Bashir's movements after he walks free."

Jonathan Hall QC said there had been a ""steady drumbeat"" of terror attacks on prison officers while other inmates were coming under the influence of ""high status"" terrorist prisoners.
Khairi Saadallah, who was given a whole life sentence earlier this month for murdering three men in a terror attack in a Reading park, had been befriended by a radical preacher while serving an earlier prison term.
Mr Hall said that he had been amazed at the way terrorist prisoners were looked up to by other inmates.

Jonathan Hall QC said there had been a ""steady drumbeat"" of terror attacks on prison officers while other inmates were coming under the influence of ""high status"" terrorist prisoners.

Mr Hall, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that if terrorist activity was taking place in jails then it had to be dealt with.

""There has been a steady drumbeat over recent years of terrorist attacks against prison officers, and an increasing number of individuals who may well have formed their terrorist intent in prison under the influence of high status terrorist prisoners,"" he told The Times.

""If terrorism exists (in prison) then it ought to be dealt with. We need scrutiny of how prisons operate to either contain, or worse encourage, terrorism.""

His comments follow a series of high-profile cases, including the 2019 London Bridge attack when Usman Khan, a terrorist prisoner out on licence, stabbed two people to death.

Khairi Saadallah, who was given a whole life sentence earlier this month for murdering three men in a terror attack in a Reading park, had been befriended by a radical preacher while serving an earlier prison term.

Last year Brusthom Ziamani, who was serving a 19-year sentence for plotting to behead a soldier, was convicted of attempted murder for trying to hack an officer to death in the maximum security Whitemoor jail.

Mr Hall said that he had been amazed at the way terrorist prisoners were looked up to by other inmates.

""I find it astonishing that someone should go to prison for plotting a terrorist atrocity and the concern is not that they themselves are at risk of attack, like a paedophile is often at risk of attack because prisoners generally say what they've done is terrible,"" he said.

""Terrorists automatically achieve a sort of status.""

The Ministry of Justice told The Times that it had trained more than 29,000 prison officers to better spot signs of extremism, increased the number of specialist counter-terrorism staff, and would separate the most subversive prisoners where necessary.

“Our tough measures to stop extremists spreading their poisonous ideologies in prison have been stepped up,” a spokesperson said.

""We ended the automatic early release of terrorists and our new legislation means they will also face tougher sentences and monitoring on release.""

He said he was scheduled to speak with Ardern today but added that legislation passed in parliament automatically cancels the citizenship of a dual citizen accused of being engaged in terrorist activities.

The woman’s case has been known to Australian and New Zealand authorities for some time. Ardern said that after Australia stripped her of her citizenship, she told Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the decision was wrong.

“I never believed the right response was to simply have a race to revoke people’s citizenships ... they did not act in good faith,” she said.

Ardern said her government has an obligation to its citizens regardless of the circumstances or offences committed, and that decisions would be driven by the fact that two small children “who did not make the choice of being born in a war zone” were involved."

JTAC is based at MI5's headquarters in London and is made up of counter-terror experts from the police, government and security agencies.

They had moved the terror threat level up to ""severe"" from ""substantial"" in November last year in the wake of an attack on the Austrian capital, Vienna.

At the time, a UK security source told Sky News there was no specific threat to the UK but that recent attacks in Europe had felt ""different in tactic and tempo"", with the raised threat level a response to that.

In November 2019, the terror threat level went below ""severe"" for the first time in five years.

The highest level, ""critical"", was last reached in September 2017, in the wake of the Parsons Green train bombing.

The five terror threat levels are:

Low - an attack is highly unlikely

Moderate - an attack is possible, but not likely

Substantial - an attack is likely

Severe - an attack is highly likely

Critical - an attack is highly likely in the near future

Analysis: Islamic State's ideology hasn't evaporated and so the threat remains

By Alistair Bunkall, defence and security correspondent

The UK threat level is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, known as JTAC.

Based out of MI5's headquarters at Thames House in London, they are operationally independent from politics, government and the intelligence agencies.

JTAC, according to its mission statement, ""brings together counter-terrorist expertise from the police, and government departments and agencies so information is analysed and processed on a shared basis"".

The threat level is designed to be a dynamic decision, reflecting the international and domestic security situation and rising and falling with some regularity as-and-when things change.

The raising of the UK threat level to ""severe"" in November 2020 was in response to a series of attacks around Europe, including a shooting in Vienna and two fatal knife attacks in France.

Although there was no direct intelligence suggesting an attack was imminent in the UK, the intensity of the threats coming from Europe prompted the rise.

Three months later, JTAC has decided that the threat has receded sufficiently to lower the level to ""substantial"", meaning that an attack is now ""likely"" rather than ""highly likely"".

This should be seen as a commentary on the global picture of Islamist terrorism specifically, rather than the lesser, but still constant threat of right-wing attacks in Britain.

The intent and capability from groups such as Islamic State and Al Qaeda remains and domestic-generated lone attacks are still a possibility.

Islamic State is quietly regrouping in parts north east Syria and Iraq, using the distraction of the COVID pandemic to rebuild.

Coalition airstrikes continue, as does the cyber effort against the group, but the Islamic State ideology hasn't evaporated and so the threat remains, albeit not as concentrated as it was a few years ago."

Although the Proud Boys have never mounted an attack in Canada, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said domestic intelligence forces had become increasingly worried about the group.

“There has been a serious and concerning escalation of violence - not just rhetoric but activity and planning - and that is why we have responded as we have today,” he told a news conference. He did not give details.

The group’s assets can now be frozen by banks and financial institutions, and it is a crime for Canadians to knowingly deal with assets of a listed entity. Anyone belonging to the group can be blocked from entering Canada.

The group’s founder, Gavin McInnes, is Canadian who lives in the United States.

U.S. authorities have charged several members of the Proud Boys in connection with the Jan 6. attack in Washington.

Ottawa added 12 other groups to its list of terrorist entities - three neo-Nazi groups, eight organizations described as affiliates to al Qaeda and Daesh (Islamic State), as well as Hizbul Mujahideen, a Kashmiri group.

Blair said Canadian intelligence agencies had been working for months and in some cases years to gather evidence needed to list the groups.

“Canada will not tolerate ideological, religious or politically motivated acts of violence,” said Blair.

Founded in 2016, the Proud Boys began as an organization protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity in the United States and Canada, and grew into a group that embraced street fighting.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump, asked last September whether he would denounce white supremacists and militia groups, called on the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by”.

The listing will likely have “a bit of a polarizing response” on Proud Boys members, said Jessica Davis, a former senior intelligence analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service spy agency.

“For some individuals this may have a dampening effect ... However, there are probably some hard-core members who will be further radicalized by this,” said Davis, president of Insight Threat Intelligence.

It is tough to say how many Proud Boys members there are in Canada, said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Anti-Hate Network of Canada.

“Before the announcement there were about eight chapters,” he said by phone. “I would expect they’re pretty much done for here ... under that name, they’re done.”

The group itself does not hold major financial assets, as far as Balgord knows.

The move underscored constitutional concerns about a Canadian government’s ability to designate a group as a terrorist entity, said Leah West, a national security professor at Ottawa’s Carleton University and former lawyer with the Canadian justice department.

Designations are impossible to challenge beforehand and difficult to address afterward, especially given lawyers may be reluctant to provide counsel to members of a terrorist group, she said by phone."

Authorities in Denmark and Germany have arrested a total of 14 people in the last week on suspicion of planning ""one or more"" terrorist attacks, according to the Danish Security and Intelligence Service.

The agency, known as PET, said in a release that it had detained 13 suspects in separate incidents, and that German authorities had arrested another person in a case ""linked"" to the investigation.

Working with police, PET said it arrested seven people between Feb. 6 and 8, on attempted terrorism charges. The suspects are charged with acquiring ""ingredients and components for manufacturing explosives"" and firearms, or aiding and abetting in the offense. The Court of Holbæk — about 40 miles west of Copenhagen — ordered the detention of another six people on Thursday, PET said, adding that those individuals are ""all involved in the case.""

""We believe that there are individuals with the intent and capacity to commit terrorist attacks in Denmark,"" the agency said.

Danish broadcaster DR reports that the seven terror suspects have pleaded not guilty. The charges against the six other Danish suspects or the individual arrested in Germany have not yet been made public. Of the 13 people detained in Denmark, eight are men and five are women.

At a press briefing on Friday, PET operations chief Flemming Drejer said police had made ""worrying findings"" during their searches, turning up items including ingredients for making bombs, detonators, pump guns and a hunting rifle with binoculars.

Denmark's Jyllands-Posten newspaper reported that investigators also found an ISIS flag, which Drejer said indicates that those involved ""may be inspired by militant Islamism.""

Still, he said at the briefing that there was ""no imminent danger"" of an attack, noting that the bomb-making ingredients had not yet been put together.

PET said the case does not change its assessment of Denmark's terror threat, which is classified as ""significant.""

Nick Hækkerup, Denmark's minister of justice, called the arrests a ""major anti-terror operation"" in a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday.

""Unfortunately, the case shows that the terrorist threat against Denmark remains serious,"" he wrote. ""But we have a skilled and vigilant police who have shown that they take care of us.""

He also thanked German authorities for their cooperation, which PET called ""excellent and efficient.""

German authorities said three of the suspects are Syrian brothers ages 33, 36 and 40, according to local media reports. Two were arrested in Denmark and one in Germany over the weekend after authorities say they followed a tip about a suspicious online order of chemicals in January that can be used to make bombs.

When investigators obtained a warrant to search the apartment in Germany, they found a variety of pyrotechnics and a ""self-painted"" ISIS flag, but not the substances from the order, a spokesman for federal prosecutors in the eastern German town of Naumburg said. Those chemicals were found in Denmark, according to Jyllands-Posten.

Denmark has been grappling with concerns over extremist attacks since 2005, when Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Such depictions are considered blasphemous in Islam, and the incident sparked widespread backlash.

Danish authorities have foiled a number of plots in recent years. In Dec. 2019, police arrested some 20 people over their suspected involvement in Islamist terrorism. They also arrested a man suspected of planning a terror attack with a ""militant Islamic motive"" in April 2020.

The statement was the first time the ISD disclosed in detail how terror suspects are handled.
Each rehabilitation programme is customised to a detainee or Restriction Order (RO) supervisee's unique circumstances, with extensive collaboration between the various rehabilitation stakeholders to maximise the chances of successful rehabilitation for the individuals, said the ISD.

The approach is a ""holistic, intensive and long-term one"", the Internal Security Department (ISD) said in a media statement on Wednesday (Feb 3).

The statement was the first time the ISD disclosed in detail how terror suspects are handled.

It came a week after the department revealed that a 16-year-old Protestant Christian youth had been detained under the ISA in December for planning terrorist attacks on two mosques.

Each rehabilitation programme is customised to a detainee or Restriction Order (RO) supervisee's unique circumstances, with extensive collaboration between the various rehabilitation stakeholders to maximise the chances of successful rehabilitation for the individuals, said the ISD.

""ISD realised early on that we cannot rely on kinetic approaches alone to tackle the terrorism threat facing us because, ultimately, we are engaged in a battle for hearts and minds,"" an ISD spokesman said.

He added that the effort to combat terrorism and radicalism in Singapore has always been a joint effort between the Government and the community.

""In the area of terrorist rehabilitation, we have been ahead of the curve compared to some countries because we have been lucky to have a Muslim community that was prepared to step up to work with the Government to deal with terrorism,"" said the spokesman.

Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said on Jan 27 that Singapore's approach of providing religious counselling to radicalised young people is better for reintegrating them back into society than charging and imprisoning them.

In its statement on Wednesday (Feb 3), the ISD said detainees and RO supervisees attend religious counselling sessions at least once a month, to get proper religious guidance and counter the radical ideology they had imbibed.

They are also given Friday prayer sermons by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis), and materials such as video lectures and books by religious scholars and teachers, to address teachings by radical religious ideologues and terrorist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Last week, the ISD said the 16-year-old, who is the first in detention to be influenced by far-right extremist ideology, will undergo Christian religious counselling.

Throughout their detention and after their release on RO, the detainees will work closely with psychologists to address their propensity for hatred and violence, and their vulnerability to radical influence, the ISD said.

""The psychologists will also help them to re-frame the faulty reasoning that underlie their radical beliefs. As part of this process, the psychologists regularly assess behavioural and cognitive aspects of the detainees' progress in rehabilitation,"" it said."

ANKARA

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Feb. 17 vowed to continue Turkey’s military offensive against terrorism following the illegal PKK group’s killing of 13 Turkish citizens in northern Iraq’s Gara region.

“We will continue our struggle with determination until we crush the head of terrorism and completely solve the problem of terrorism. We will continue our operations,” Erdoğan said while addressing his party’s provincial congress.

Erdoğan also criticized the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) Chair Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for his comments blaming the president for the responsibility of the Gara killing.

“Mr. Kemal, have you heard the cries of those Diyarbakır mothers? You call the president responsible for 13 martyrs without shame. How irreverent are you? Impudent man!” Erdoğan said while referring to a sit-in protest held by the mothers of children abducted by the PKK.

He noted that the government was trying to rescue the abducted citizens for the past 5-6 years.

The CHP leader on Feb. 16 posed five questions to President Erdoğan and held him responsible for the incident.

“I am sending you the defense minister, the interior minister so that they can inform you. You are not worthy of these. You try to bill the president without shame,” Erdoğan stated.

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu visited the CHP and İYİ (Good) Party on Feb. 16 and briefed the opposition parties on the details of the PKK’s killing of 13 Turks during the Operation Claw-Eagle 2.

Erdoğan accused the CHP of collaborating with the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) while the government is fighting against terrorism.

“We came to these days not with the grants of someone, but with the struggle against DAESH to PKK and FETÖ. You should eliminate the DHKP-C members in your organization first,” he said.

Turkey on Feb. 10 said the PKK killed 13 unarmed Turkish citizens who were held hostage since 2015.

“The PKK terrorists that were caught during the operation stated that 13 detained people were martyred by firing a bullet on their heads at the beginning of the airstrike operation,” Defense Minister Akar said on Feb. 16 in his address to the parliament."

“The continued and relentless harassment of Professor Ismail’s family is an affront to human rights,” said Rimmel Mohydin, South Asia campaigner for rights group Amnesty International.
On Monday, the Peshawar High Court ruled to allow the trial of human rights activist Idrees Khattak by a military court on espionage charges.
Khattak, a prominent rights activist, was abducted by unidentified men in November 2019 while travelling in his car.
“Currently, the situation for human rights activists in Pakistan is very restricted, civic spaces are being eliminated and human rights are being criminalised,” said Gulalai.","father, activist, peshawar, gulalai, muhammad, arrested, human, court, charges, military, pakistan, terror, rights, case, pakistani",terror,Terrorism,"Islamabad, Pakistan – A Pakistani court has granted police custody of Muhammad Ismail, the father of a prominent Pakistani human rights activist, on “terrorism” charges that rights groups say are part of a sustained campaign of harassment.

The court in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar granted police custody of Muhammad for three days during proceedings on Wednesday, his daughter, Gulalai Ismail, told Al Jazeera. The 66-year-old had been arrested a day earlier at a bail confirmation hearing.

Gulalai, a prominent and award-winning women’s rights activist, is a leading member of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) rights group that calls for accountability for Pakistan’s powerful military for alleged rights abuses committed during its war against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and its allies.

The PTM and other rights groups have documented hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings during the campaign in the country’s northwest. Its leaders, including members of Parliament, have faced a widespread campaign of arrests and legal cases against them across Pakistan since the group’s formation in 2018.





In 2019, Gulalai was forced into hiding due to threats against her life, with security services seeking her arrest in a number of cases, including charging her with “sedition” for remarks made during a speech at a PTM rally.

Later that year, she surfaced in the United States, where she is seeking political asylum.

“They just want to harass my family and to break their nerves,” said Gulalai. “To break their morale to set a precedent, that if any […] father lets his daughter speak her mind and use her freedom of expression, then the parents will also not meet a good fate.”

‘Goodbye’ Facebook and Twitter

Muhammad is a retired professor of Urdu language and lives with his 62-year-old wife, Uzlifat, in a modest suburb of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.

Following Gulalai’s escape from the country, both her parents were charged with “terrorism financing” in a case that went on for more than a year. In July 2020, that case was dismissed by a Peshawar anti-terrorism court judge for lack of evidence.

Weeks later, authorities refiled the charges with the additional allegation that Gulalai’s parents had directly facilitated a 2013 attack on a Peshawar church that killed more than 78 people and a 2015 attack on a Shia Muslim mosque that killed more than 20 worshippers.

The Ismail family denied the allegations.

Separately, authorities filed a second case against Muhammad alleging he was sharing “anti-state” content on social media. Hearings, in that case, are ongoing, with a judge in January ordering him to stop sharing “objectionable content”.

“Honouring the orders of the court, I hereby surrender my right to share my dissident voices on social media, therefore say goodbye to Facebook and Twitter,” Muhammad told Al Jazeera after that hearing.





He was arrested on Tuesday after a judge ruled to deny him confirmation of interim bail granted a day earlier in the “terrorism” case. Uzlifat, his wife, implicated in the same case, was granted bail.

“The continued and relentless harassment of Professor Ismail’s family is an affront to human rights,” said Rimmel Mohydin, South Asia campaigner for rights group Amnesty International.

“He has been abducted, forced to make multiple court appearances and faces a travel ban since 2019. Now that he’s been detained, at great risk to his already precarious health – made worse by a recent COVID-19 diagnosis – the charges against him must be dropped immediately.”

The arrest of Muhammad comes amid a tightening of space for freedom of expression, particularly criticism of the powerful military, and human rights work in Pakistan.

On Monday, the Peshawar High Court ruled to allow the trial of human rights activist Idrees Khattak by a military court on espionage charges.

Khattak, a prominent rights activist, was abducted by unidentified men in November 2019 while travelling in his car. Months later, Pakistan’s military admitted he was in their custody as they investigated him under the country’s Official Secrets Act.

On Monday, the government’s lawyer contended Khattak was being tried for having held meetings more than 10 years ago with Michael Semple, an academic and former United Nations official who Pakistan considers an agent of British foreign intelligence agency MI6.

“Currently, the situation for human rights activists in Pakistan is very restricted, civic spaces are being eliminated and human rights are being criminalised,” said Gulalai."

Their comments came during the committee’s first hearing in its investigation into the riot that has moved House Democrats and 10 Republicans to impeach the now-former president for an unprecedented second time. The panel’s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), indicated that he expected its probe would result in concrete legislation to punish and dissuade such attacks, and better monitor and regulate the environments in which extremist ideologies proliferate.

“We have to do something,” Thompson said during the hearing. “I’m sure somewhere there will be agreement on specific legislation.”

But although both Democrats and Republicans on the panel showed enthusiasm for select ventures, it is not yet clear where leaders might prioritize their efforts — or if, in the end, they will be able to find enough common ground to avoid political stalemate.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), the committee’s former chairman, joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers calling for legislation to set specific federal penalties for domestic terrorism cases. Such legislation would aim to bring the prosecution of such crimes into parity with laws targeting terrorism that originates overseas — something proponents said would recognize that the threats are equally insidious.

“What happened Jan. 6 just cries out” for such a response, McCaul said. “I think it sends a strong message about where Congress is, that we’re going to treat domestic terrorism on an equal plane as international terrorism.”

Several lawmakers said they also endorse targeting social media companies with legislation meant to hold them accountable when extremist propaganda is circulated on their platforms. Some backed the approach set out in a bill, co-written by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), seeking to overhaul of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law giving technology companies liability protection from what third parties post on their sites.

“They’ve dragged their feet too long,” Neumann told lawmakers, referring to social media companies and noting that although the preference was to have business “self-correct … we might be at the point where it is needed for Congress to pass legislation to address the problem.”

Despite their unanimous condemnation of the Capitol attack and white supremacy, the experts assembled Thursday were not in lockstep when it came to recommendations for how Congress ought to go about legislating a response. While Greenblatt came with a seven-part plan, including specific legislative recommendations to increase penalties and for funding mitigation activities, Brian Michael Jenkins of the Rand Corp. took the opposite approach, recommending that prosecutors might do best to go after domestic terrorists by leveraging existing statutes.

Even with bipartisan support for new legislation, there are several political pitfalls on the road to passing it. Some House Democrats have accused certain Republican colleagues of aiding and abetting the Capitol rioters, and across the Capitol the parties remain divided over whether then-President Donald Trump is to blame for inciting the attack.

Thursday’s hearing was held against the backdrop of a debate over whether freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) should be ousted from her committee assignments for espousing conspiracy theories Democrats have labeled dangerous. Late Thursday, the House voted largely along party lines to do so after Greene had pushed back against the accusations, calling them a form of thought crime and decrying Democrats for trying to stifle her right to free speech.

The debate appeared to spill over into Thursday’s hearing, as Rep. Andrew S. Clyde of Georgia — also a first-term Republican — suggested that activists were too quick to brand people with unorthodox and even offensive views as extremists.

The Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, added Morocco, Burkina Faso, Senegal and the Cayman Islands to the watch list during a plenary session this week, and kept Pakistan on the list despite the country’s progress, agency president Marcus Pleyer said.

With the four additions, the so-called gray list currently has 19 countries and territories that FATF said are only partially fulfilling international rules for fighting terrorism financing and money laundering.

FATF is made up of 37 member countries and two regional groups, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the EU Commission.

Pakistan has made “significant progress in its effort to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework,” Pleyer said during a news conference. “However, some serious deficiencies remain,” all in areas related to terrorist financing, he said.

Of the 27 items on the action plan Pakistan signed onto after landing on the gray list in 2018, three “still need to be fully addressed,” the FATF chief said.

“I strongly urge completion of the action plan,” Pleyer said, noting that deadlines to implement it have expired. Pakistan’s status will be reviewed again at an extraordinary plenary session in June, he said. Members would decide the next steps if requirements are not met.

Pakistan has worked hard to raise its international profile and reinvent itself as a promoter of peace, making it a focus of attention each time its status comes up for review.

A Pakistani-based independent think tank, Tabadlab, this week estimated the cost to Pakistan’s economy of the FATF gray listing at a staggering $38 billion.

A report prepared by economist Naafey Sardar, senior research associate professor at Texas A&M University in San Antonio, said there was a cumulative effect on Pakistan’s real gross domestic product because of the gray listing, which caused a sharp reduction in consumption, exports and foreign direct investment. “These results point to the significant negative consequences associated with FATF grey-listing,” Sardar’s report said.

Among additions to the grey list, Morocco, among other things, must strengthen its financial intelligence unit, “one of the core authorities in the fight against money laundering,” the FATF president said.

North Korea and Iran remain the only two countries on the black list, the high risk list, although their status was not reviewed during the latest session. The black list designation means international financial transactions with those countries are closely scrutinized, making it costly and cumbersome to do business with them. International creditors can also place restrictions on lending to black-listed countries.

North Korea’s financing of weapons of mass destruction is a top concern. Iran has made “some progress” since committing to an action plan in 2016, the FATF chief said, but still has serious lapses like failure to sign two international conventions against terror financing.

The FATF said that the COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped criminals from exploiting it for their financial gain.

The money, part of a larger $1.87 billion pool of grant funding to help state and local governments face threats and emergencies, will “help raise the nation’s security baseline,” according to Mayorkas.

“While we continue to lawfully protect against threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations, we also must ensure adequate focus and funding is provided to combat domestic terrorism, some of which is motivated by false narratives and extremist rhetoric spread through social media and other online platforms,” Mayorkas added.

The money, part of a larger $1.87 billion pool of grant funding to help state and local governments face threats and emergencies, will “help raise the nation’s security baseline,” according to Mayorkas. The grants for domestic violent extremism will fund programs aimed at “open source analysis of threats, execution of threat assessment programs, the development and sharing of intelligence across states and between states and the federal government, and the development of training and awareness programs,” he said.

DHS in recent years has begun turning its attention inward to pay more attention to threats from hate groups, homegrown extremists and violent racists. The 2019 mass shooting in El Paso — the deadliest attack on Hispanic Americans in modern U.S. history — was a catalyzing event for department officials.

DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis was one of the federal agencies that did not alert federal law enforcement agencies to plans by pro-Trump groups to storm the U.S. Capitol and attempt to prevent a presidential transition.

Pressure from lawmakers on DHS to do more has increased since then. While the FBI remains the lead federal agency for investigating domestic extremist groups and stopping attacks, DHS officials want to leverage relationships with state and local police departments formed after the 9/11 attacks to produce better threat reports and promote preventive strategies.

A week after Biden’s inauguration, DHS used its National Terrorism Advisory System for the first time to alert the public to the risk of attacks by domestic groups, citing “a heightened threat environment across the United States.”

In 2019, DHS created the Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which has hired regional coordinators across the country to help state and local governments identify violent extremists and try to stop them from recruiting and radicalizing others.

During recent hearings on Capitol Hill, many Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for DHS to increase its focus on homegrown extremists, though lawmakers have clashed over priorities. Republican members say Democrats were unwilling to condemn violent protesters and anarchists during clashes last summer on the streets of Portland, Ore., where DHS agents and officers were sent to protect federal buildings."

The boy, now 16, from south-east Cornwall, was just 13 when he first downloaded bomb-making instructions.
At 14 he had amassed a stash of terror material and shared far-right ideology including racist, homophobic and antisemitic views in online chatrooms.
Dennis told him he had “entered an online world of wicked prejudice” and any reoffending would lead to a “spiral of ever lengthening terms of incarceration” to protect the public.
He said: “You entered an online world of wicked prejudice and violent bigotry which has no place in a civilised society.","rehabilitation, neonazi, youth, youngest, prejudice, online, terrorist, britains, wicked, views, weapon, jail, convicted, avoids, world",terror,Terrorism,"Britain’s youngest ever convicted terrorist, who led a neo-Nazi cell from his grandmother’s house, has been sentenced to a two-year non-custodial rehabilitation order.

The boy, now 16, from south-east Cornwall, was just 13 when he first downloaded bomb-making instructions. At 14 he had amassed a stash of terror material and shared far-right ideology including racist, homophobic and antisemitic views in online chatrooms.

By the time his home was raided by police in July 2019, he had become the British cell leader of the Feuerkrieg Division, a neo-Nazi group that encouraged members to commit Anders Breivik-style terror attacks and was responsible for vetting and enlisting new members.

One of his five UK recruits was Paul Dunleavy, 17, who was jailed last November for five and a half years for preparing for acts of neo-Nazi terrorism, and with whom he had discussed obtaining firearms. Another recruit, the court heard, was an undercover police officer.

Police raided the teenager’s home, which he shared with his grandmother, on the basis of information that he had been constructing a weapon. No weapon was found, but his phone and laptop were seized and during the search officers found a Nazi flag and a copy of a neo-Nazi text. A Nazi slogan had been painted on the garden shed.

The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to 12 offences – two of dissemination of terrorist documents and 10 of possession of terrorist material – and was handed the 24-month youth rehabilitation order by Judge Mark Dennis QC at the Old Bailey. He was sentenced by video link from Bodmin magistrates court, where he was supported by his grandmother, who held his hand.

Dennis told him he had “entered an online world of wicked prejudice” and any reoffending would lead to a “spiral of ever lengthening terms of incarceration” to protect the public. However, taking into account the boy’s guilty plea and expressions of remorse, he ruled out custody, saying it would undo the rehabilitation work that was already under way.

He said: “You entered an online world of wicked prejudice and violent bigotry which has no place in a civilised society. You are now 16, coming on 17, years of age and any naivety or immaturity that may have played its part can no longer be put forward as an excuse.

“Any resurfacing of such prejudice or bigotry or engagement in such extremist activity will inevitably lead you in one direction, and that is in a spiral of ever lengthening terms of incarceration in order to protect the public from such conduct. You now have the opportunity to put this behind you and to redirect your future.”

Naomi Parsons, prosecuting, said the defendant’s young age was “alarming” and his conduct “betrays a maturity beyond his chronological age”.

In mitigation, Deni Matthews said the youth was “damaged” and had “sought approval by expressing views he certainly does not ascribe to now and was unlikely to have ascribed to genuinely at the time”."

“She was put (in detention) while awaiting her return which will be facilitated by the British Embassy,” Indonesian immigration directorate spokesman Ahmad Nursaleh told AFP, without elaborating.

Indonesia has detained a British woman named on a list of global terror suspects and plans to deport her for visa violations, authorities told the AFP news agency.

Tazneen Miriam Sailar – a Manchester-born convert to Islam once married to a now-deceased Indonesian fighter – is not charged with terror offences.

But she and her late husband are also on an Indonesian police list of suspected domestic and foreign fighters, which includes a Frenchman who appeared in the ISIL (ISIS) group’s beheading videos and another close to the brothers who massacred staff at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Sailar, 47, and her 10-year-old Indonesia-born son were being held in Jakarta after they were picked up last year on allegations she did not have the required documents to remain in the Southeast Asian nation, according to her lawyer Farid Ghozali.

“She was put (in detention) while awaiting her return which will be facilitated by the British Embassy,” Indonesian immigration directorate spokesman Ahmad Nursaleh told AFP, without elaborating.





British Embassy declines to comment

The British Embassy in Jakarta declined to comment and it was unclear when the deportation would happen.

The police document does not say why Sailar was listed along with some 400 other terror suspects, including her late husband who was killed in Syria in 2015, sources said.

The couple’s 2010 marriage was officiated by Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual head of group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), according to sources familiar with the case.

JI members were behind the Bali bombings which saw more than 200 people, including nearly 90 Australian holidaymakers, killed when massive blasts ripped through a pair of packed bars on the Indonesian holiday island in October 2002.

Sailar operated a charity named after her late husband, which sent aid to women and children in conflict-wracked Syria, sources said.

She arrived in Muslim-majority Indonesia in 2005 as a medical volunteer for a Christian humanitarian foundation that assisted victims of natural disasters, Ghozali and a source said.

Alleged members of the Taliban and ISIL appear on the Indonesian police list, as well as British national Anjem Choudary and Sally-Anne Jones, an ISIL recruiter reportedly killed in a US drone attack in Syria.





Maxime Hauchard, a now-dead French convert seen in a gruesome ISIL beheading video, was listed along with French fighter Peter Cherif, previously charged with the 2011 kidnapping of three French aid workers in Yemen and a close associate of the siblings who killed staff at Charlie Hebdo in 2015.

Sailar was born in Manchester on February 20, 1973, and holds a British passport, according to the list, which also said she goes by at least two aliases.

Indonesia’s counter-terror squad questioned Sailar but no charges were filed, her lawyer said.

“So we’re now focused on immigration matters,” he said, adding that Sailar wants to remain in Indonesia."

Its publication was a “humbling moment”, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, said in evidence on Tuesday. The inquiry heard that nearly 90% of the review’s recommendations had since been delivered.

On day 58, the inquiry heard from just one witness, Basu, who is the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for UK counter-terror policing.

He was senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing on the night of the Arena bombing and it was his job to assume national strategic command of the events and the investigative response. He declared the incident a terrorist attack at 12.56am on 23 May 2017 and effectively took responsibility for national strategic command from this point.

Basu told the inquiry that, after the attack, the then prime minister, Theresa May, told him “you need to break the momentum” of terror attacks in the UK.

Although an operational improvement review made 103 recommendations for how UK counter-terror operations could be improved, Basu said he still felt “we have the best counter-terrorism machine in the world in this country”.

Basu began by expressing his “deepest sympathies” on behalf of Britain’s counter-terrorism network. “This is a network designed to stop there being victims and I have met far too many in my career. I know the terrible burden that not just the event but having to sit through inquests, criminal trials and inquiries has on those people, I know how brutal it is.”

The inquiry heard he was not responsible for the immediate policing response to the attack which fell to Greater Manchester police’s gold strategic commander, the assistant chief constable Debbie Ford.

Basu told the inquiry that it was only right that the local force is responsible for coordinating the police response, saying: “It would be wrong and idiotic for someone in London to try and make decisions about what was unfolding in Manchester.”

The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday."

Two Islamist plots and one rightwing terror plot were thwarted, bringing the total number of foiled attacks since March 2017 to 28, said the counter-terrorism policing network.

The revelation was made as official figures from the Home Office showed the number of arrests for terrorism-related activity fell by 34% in 2020, the lowest level in nine years, although this was pinned on an overall reduction in crime during the pandemic.

The statistics also reveal that one in five people behind bars for terrorism offences in Britain last year were rightwing extremists, the highest proportion since records began, while a rise in arrests was only recorded for the under-18s category.

Dean Haydon, a deputy assistant commissioner and senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said: “These statistics tell me two things. Firstly, that despite facing unprecedented challenges brought about by the pandemic, counter-terrorism policing continued to keep the public safe by making 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations – stopping three possible terror attacks in the process.

“And secondly, that while the rest of us have been focused on protecting ourselves and our families from this terrible disease, terrorists have not stopped planning attacks or radicalising vulnerable people online.”

Since March 2017, counter-terrorism police and UK intelligence services have stopped 28 attacks; 18 were Islamist related, nine were classed as rightwing terrorism, and one was labelled “left, anarchist or single-issue terrorism”.

The number of arrests for terrorism-related activity fell from 282 to 185 in the year to December, the lowest since 2011.

Haydon said it was “worrying” that children under 18 were the only age category where an increase was recorded – rising from 11 to 17 cases. That is a total of 10% of all arrests, a rise from 4% in the previous 12 months.

The number of white people arrested was 89, compared with 63 people of Asian appearance and 15 people of black appearance, the report said.

There were 209 prisoners in 2020 of whom 42 were classed as holding “extreme rightwing” views, up from 18% the previous year.

While 75% of prisoners were classed as having Islamist extremist views, the number of inmates recorded as holding this ideology fell from 177 to 156 in the 12-month period.

In all 31 convicted terrorists were released from jail as well as 11 suspects who had been held in custody but not sentenced in the year to September, according to the data. Figures to December are not yet available.

Of the 185 arrested in 2020, 56 (30%) led to a charge, 48 of which were terrorism related. And 73 suspects (39%) were released on bail or released under investigation, meaning they were not subject to any restrictions while police inquiries continued.

A further 13 (7%) faced other action such as a caution or being recalled to prison, while 40 suspects (22%) were released without charge."

The director said he had warned repeatedly of the mounting domestic threat in recent years and again defended the bureau's handling of the threat report distributed the night before the attack.
'Far-right extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat'Wray's testimony comes six months after he offered a now-prescient warning of the threat posed by domestic extremists.
Wray said the Capitol extremists represent just part of a burgeoning domestic threat landscape in which agents are working about 2,000 investigations, double the number the FBI reported four years ago.
Citing the ""massive"" scale of the Capitol investigation and a ""metastasizing"" overall domestic threat, Wray acknowledged Tuesday that the bureau needed more help.","cases, antifa, director, domestic, chasing, extremists, address, arent, investigation, wray, fbi, law, threat, terror, suspects, capitol",terror,Terrorism,"FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday described an ominous warning the night before the Capitol riots about the prospect of extreme violence as ""raw, unverified, uncorroborated information"" – but he said the bureau's report was shared extensively with Capitol Police and other authorities.

Wray said the report, which concluded that extremists were ""preparing for war,"" was provided to authorities at the command level, distributed to its local Joint Terrorism Task Force network and posted on a national electronic portal for review by law enforcement authorities across the country.

The FBI director's testimony before a Senate panel comes nearly a week after former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told a separate Senate investigating committee that the intelligence never made it to him and others before the attack that left five dead, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick.

Sund acknowledged that the bulletin landed at the Capitol police agency's intelligence unit but was never forwarded.

Though Wray told lawmakers Tuesday that he did not become aware of the report's existence until ""some number of days"" after Jan. 6, he said the contents of the advisory were important enough for the FBI to distribute it across law enforcement at the time.

""Because of the level of detail that was in it, the judgment was, given the press of time, given the specificity ... was to push it to the people who needed it,"" he said.

Pressed by lawmakers on why the information had not been seen by either the former Capitol chief, who resigned shortly after the attack, or the acting District of Columbia police chief, Wray said, ""I don't have a good answer.""

""It was more than just an email,"" the director said, adding that at least five Capitol police officers who also serve as members of a Capitol-area terrorism task force would have received it.

In addition to the report's placement on an electronic portal, Wray said, the information was included a ""verbal"" briefing for law enforcement officials at a local command center.

But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., citing the volume of threat-related information circulating across social media in the days before Jan. 6, suggested that the FBI should have called more urgent attention to the risk.

""Why didn't you sound the alarm in a more visible and ringing way?"" Blumenthal asked.

The director said he had warned repeatedly of the mounting domestic threat in recent years and again defended the bureau's handling of the threat report distributed the night before the attack.

'Far-right extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat'

Wray's testimony comes six months after he offered a now-prescient warning of the threat posed by domestic extremists.

“Trends may shift, but the underlying drivers for domestic violent extremism – such as perceptions of government or law enforcement overreach, sociopolitical conditions, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, misogyny and reactions to legislative actions – remain constant,” Wray said then.

The director on Tuesday described how the Capitol assault involved some of the very classes of extremists he warned about in September.

Wray said the Capitol extremists represent just part of a burgeoning domestic threat landscape in which agents are working about 2,000 investigations, double the number the FBI reported four years ago.

In opening Tuesday’s hearing, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., declared that the “federal government has failed to address the growing terrorist menace in our own backyard.”

He took sharp aim at the Trump administration, saying officials “spent four years downplaying the threat posed by white supremacists.”

""It was only after Black Lives Matter activists protested last summer against police misconduct that the (Trump) administration found the need to establish a task force to address anti-government extremists,” Durbin said.

“We need to be abundantly clear that white supremacists and other far-right extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United States today,” Durbin said. “I hope that everyone in this room can look at the facts and acknowledge this, and that we can come together on a bipartisan basis to defeat this threat.”

Domestic right-wing extremists were responsible for almost 70% of terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. in 2020, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

In 'massive' Capitol investigation, antifa aren't

Wray's testimony comes as a separate joint committee of the Senate continues its investigation of the Capitol assault and law enforcement's failure to prepare for it and repel the rioters.

Since the attack, the FBI has been leading a far-reaching criminal investigation that has resulted in charges against more than 300 suspects and the arrests of at least 280 others.

Wray acknowledged that followers of the left-leaning ideology known as Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – and Black Lives Matter are not among the hundreds swept up so far in the ongoing Capitol investigation, dispelling unfounded conspiracy theories advanced by Trump supporters.

On Tuesday, Wray was pressed for an update into the federal investigation into Sicknick's death and conflicting accounts about the cause of his death.

The director said the bureau still was not in a position to determine the exact cause of death.

Under Wray's direction, the bureau has been examining tens of thousands of digital images leading to the identification of suspected rioters while appealing for the public's help to identify suspects who were involved in planting pipe bombs at the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees.

Investigators believe the live explosives were delivered to the sites between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m., the evening before the attack.

In January, the FBI released images of a unidentified suspect dressed in a gray hoodie and carrying a backpack. Prominently featured in the FBI's appeal included the suspect's footwear, described as Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes in yellow, black and gray.

Citing the ""massive"" scale of the Capitol investigation and a ""metastasizing"" overall domestic threat, Wray acknowledged Tuesday that the bureau needed more help.

""We need more agents; we need more analysts,"" the director said.

Threats persist

Last week, federal officials said that the threat to the Biden administration persists and that authorities are ""very closely"" monitoring the run-up to President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress.

The assessment, provided in a domestic terror briefing, followed a separate warning by acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, who told lawmakers that ""militia groups"" that took part in the Jan. 6 attack seek to ""blow up the Capitol,"" possibly targeting Biden's address.

In the coming weeks, Biden is expected to give his first formal address to Congress – similar to a State of the Union address. The date of the speech has not yet been scheduled.

Sahayb Abu, 27, had bought two blades, balaclavas, a camouflage hat and body armour online in readiness for the planned terror attack last summer, the Old Bailey heard. He was arrested on 9 July after discussing guns with an undercover police officer, who he met on an Isis supporters’ Telegram chat group.

A jury deliberated for 21 hours and 32 minutes to find him guilty of preparing for terrorist acts by a majority of 11 to one.

His brother, Muhamed Abu, 32, wept as he was cleared of failing to disclose information about a plot to authorities. He appeared distressed at his sibling’s conviction, sobbing: “He’s a clown, he’s a buffoon.”

Following the verdicts, Commander Richard Smith said Sahayb Abu was a “very dangerous individual”, despite portraying himself as a clownish aspiring rapper called Masked Menace.

Smith, the head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Sahayb had murderous intent, some of that was evidenced from the kind of things that he was posting online and sharing with others, including his brother.”

The court heard how some of the defendants’ relatives had been linked to extremism in the past. The defendants’ half-brothers Wail and Suleyman Aweys went to Syria in 2015, where they are both believed to have died, the court was told.

Two years later, the court heard, the defendants were caught with their older half-brother Ahmed Aweys putting up poppy posters in east London saying British tax was used to “kill Muslims”.

Sahayb Abu, from Dagenham in east London, went on to associate with known terrorists while serving a sentence for burglary at Wandsworth prison in south London. Among them was the Isis supporter Husnain Rashid, who was jailed for at least 25 years in 2018 for calling for an attack on Prince George.

Sahayb Abu was released from prison on 20 March last year, and went from being “locked up to locked down” as the Covid-19 pandemic struck, jurors heard. Over the next three months, he trawled the internet for Isis propaganda, including pictures of fighters in balaclavas with guns. He posed in his combat gear in homemade videos sent to Muhamed Abu.

In a disturbing rap, he described the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a “sellout” and talked about the murdered fusilier Lee Rigby.

He also posted extremist comments online and came to the attention of the undercover officer via the Telegram chat group. The pair met twice, and during their conversations used code words “silah” and “duty free” for firearms, which the officer claimed he could import.

Sahayb Abu said the time was coming to be an “action man rather than a chatty man” and commented “we need a 9/11 2.0”, in reference to the World Trade Center attacks in New York. Police took the decision to arrest the brothers on 9 July last year."

At issue for the three-judge panel Friday was whether the sentencing add-on applies only to people convicted of an underlying federal crime of terrorism. It was not clear from the few questions asked by the judges — Diana Gribbon Motz, Albert Diaz and Allison Jones Rushing — how the panel would rule.

Hasson’s attorneys say the firearm and drug charges against him had nothing to do with terrorism and that the district court judge disregarded the defense’s risk-assessment expert, who found Hasson was not on “the path to intended violence,” according to court filings. “Although he thought about violence, he did not make a choice or decision to commit violence.”

Public defender Cullen Macbeth told the court Friday that Congress intended the sentencing add-on to apply only to terrorism-related offenses specifically listed in the statute.

“I don’t know how it could be any clearer,” Macbeth said.

He also urged the court to throw out Hasson’s conviction, arguing that the law criminalizing the possession of firearms by drug addicts is unconstitutionally vague. Hasson, a Marine Corps veteran with no history of violence, was addicted to the opioid tramadol, which his lawyers said altered his mental state.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom urged the judges to defer to Congress and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which sets guidelines for the courts. The sentencing enhancement can be used, he said, even when a defendant is not convicted of a “federal crime of terrorism” as long as the offense was meant to promote or further such a crime.

“If Congress meant otherwise, it would have said,” Windom told the court.

The government’s case relied on evidence that Hasson was inspired by racist murderers, had stockpiled weapons at his home in Silver Spring, Md., and had studied bombmaking and sniper manuals, as well as racist and antisemitic manifestos.

Investigators found a spreadsheet with references to targets such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats including then-Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and cable news hosts such as Joe Scarborough. Hasson had searched for Scarborough’s home address and Googled “how can white people rise” and “civil war if trump impeached.”

U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel sided with prosecutors. He laid out a detailed timeline of Hasson’s actions and concluded: “Certainly, if he had merely expressed unpleasant thoughts, without some indications of a plan to act and the weaponry, we wouldn’t be here. But it’s the weapons with his efforts that the Court sees in the documents that he was actually in the process of formulating a plan that makes this a case where the terrorism enhancement does apply.”

Hasson’s case comes amid debate about whether law enforcement officials have the necessary tools to investigate and charge suspected domestic terrorists.

Michael German, a former FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism, said the government already has the power to deal with potential threats before they happen. Federal law includes a long list of offenses that qualify as “federal crimes of terrorism,” including 51 that apply to domestic acts. In addition, hate crime laws can be used to target white supremacists.

“To the extent that the government saw a potential threat materializing, there were sufficient authorities for them to prevent those,” said German, a fellow with the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “We don’t want to empower the government to arrest us for crimes we might commit in the future because that would be far too easy to abuse.”

Mary McCord, a former Justice Department national security official, said she shares concerns about transparency and government accountability but thinks Congress should at least consider expanding federal terrorism laws to apply to violent acts committed in the United States with firearms or vehicles when done to intimidate and coerce. That would apply to the stockpiling of firearms with the intent to commit a mass shooting in furtherance of political or social ideologies.

There are existing laws that apply to acts of terrorism committed in the United States when they are done to advance the goals of an overseas terrorist organization, but not for mass shootings or car rammings when done for ideological purposes unrelated to a foreign terrorist organization.

“People like Hasson, who are amassing an arsenal of weapons to create a white ethnostate, would be able to be charged with a crime of terrorism,” said McCord, who is executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center."

Consider that corrected by episode two, which feels like a succession of albatrosses being cross-bowed.

Remarkably though, eight months into their icebound lay-up, things are pretty perky on HMS Terror. With a lot of jolly hurrah-ing the search parties set off into the white nothingness in search of a lead toward open water, and Franklin wants to thaw relations with Crozier. Those are the two big threads of this episode: the lads on the ice wander off into the opening five minutes of The Thing, while back on the HMS Downton Abbey, it's all emotional constipation and meaningful nods.



-

Perhaps put out at being a) ignored and b) extremely likely to die slowly on the frozen wastes, Franklin's warm demeanour doesn't melt Crozier. The sun dogs everyone's seen – they're refracted sunlight bent by ice crystals in the atmosphere, meteorology fans – are a ""signs that nature does not give a damn about our plans,"" he says. Maybe it's just the arctic draught blowing right up through his bog that's upset him.

Then again, it might be because Franklin crushed Crozier's persistent attempts to marry his niece. And on this one, you've got to say: fair enough. Crozier might be sensible, but could you deal with him applying his relentless lack of swashbuckling verve to every aspect of married life? Soberly insisting that no, he will not be coming the pub, as the shed must be cleared this Sunday before winter sets in? No, you could not.

There is, however, a brilliant moment when Franklin realises –with the face of a man who's just stepped on a plug – that he's been slagging off Crozier with the door open. Crozier looks all sad in his cummerbund.

-

Out on the ice, there's a bit of good news: a cairn, and the edge of land. It's an extraordinary view onto King William Land, and one that nods at Ridley Scott's exec producing role. There are tinges here of the big vistas of The Martian or Prometheus; ashen, desolate, disorientating.

Heading hubristically into the unknown doesn't tend to turn out that well in most stories, especially ghost-adjacent spookers – that's MR James' whole thing, give or take a haunted flute – and right on cue, the supply boat's smashed to bits and gigantic orbs of ice are belting down from above. There's a strange, distant roaring, too. It might be a bear. The obvious thing to do is to give this paranoid, jumpy, exhausted bunch rifles and see who shoots the problem first. They do accidentally shoot an old Inuit man in the process, which feels like a bad vibe, and it doesn't even stop Gore being done in by a polar bear.

Back on the boats there's more claustrophobia. The teams aren't finding any routes out. Given another winter, the ice is likely to either force Terror and Erebus up and out of the water or split them in half at the waist. Even worse, the dog's left a truly gigantic poo in Crozier's room. Hickey's Irish, it turns out, and gets a drop of rum for both this and for manfully sorting out the poo situation. They're interrupted by news of the last crew arriving back.

-

The two strands of this episode tie together here. The Inuit man and his daughter are brought aboard and the final seal of Crozier's thorough decency is revealed – it's an iron law of TV drama that nobody who can speak the local language is ever wrong – while Goodsir tries to remove the shot from the old man's chest. The Inuit man dies on the ship, not on the ice as his daughter begs.

""I can’t do this on my own,"" she sobs. ""Do not ask that of me. I’m not ready. Tuunbaq will not obey me.""

What's Tuunbaq? I'm betting that it's a shapeless, unstoppable horror which can only be controlled by a learned shaman, but hey! Maybe it's a different bear. Goodsir, at least, says the men are convinced something followed them back to the boats. Over on the Erebus, Crozier's disobeyed Franklin and given the Inuit daughter shelter.

“If you want to help, take your boats away,"" she says. ""You cannot be here.""

Captain's Log:

Between brazening out the fumbling with Gibson below decks and sharing a drink with Crozier, Hickey might have quietly become the most interesting character on either ship.

His line about ""those who are quickest to tally your value, often do it on your spots alone"" is good, but his assessment of Irving – ""That’s a man afraid of chaos. He’s not gonna invite more if he can help it"" – edges it out.

The little detail that the exploratory crew's rations had rotted feels like it might be important. Could whatever this curse is have already touched the boats? Maybe the phone call was coming from inside the ship!

On Wednesday members of the joint counter terrorism team conducted raids on two homes in Epping and Pascoe Vale, arresting the boy and two men aged 19 and 20.
The 16-year-old was released on Wednesday afternoon, while the two other men are still in custody and being interviewed by police.

People have been driven into the online environment and that has exacerbated some of the radicalisation we have seen.”","religious, suspected, offences, australian, men, boy, ideology, motivated, hermans, melbourne, conducted, 16yearold, incidents, counterterrorism, terrorism, terrorrelated, arrested",terror,Terrorism,"Two men and a 16-year-old boy have been arrested in Melbourne over what police say are potentially terrorism-related offences allegedly motivated by “religious extremism”.

On Wednesday members of the joint counter terrorism team conducted raids on two homes in Epping and Pascoe Vale, arresting the boy and two men aged 19 and 20.

The 16-year-old was released on Wednesday afternoon, while the two other men are still in custody and being interviewed by police.

Charges are yet to be laid but assistant commissioner Michael Hermans, the head of Victoria police’s counter terrorism command, said police would allege the 19-year-old “attempted to engage in a terrorist act”.

“One potential outcome of that interview is they may face terror charges,” he said. “It could relate to attempted terrorism or acts in preparation of terrorism.”

Hermans said the investigation into the three men related to a fire on 18 February in bushland about 30 minutes’ drive north of Epping, as well as an assault on an individual in metropolitan Melbourne on 10 March.

Hermans said police believed the incidents might have been motivated by an “ideology based on religious extremism”, and that officers had acted on the basis that the “risk profile” of the men was “increasing”.

“It is Islamic [in] motivation,” he said. “But let me be very clear: we target the crime, not the ideology.”

Because charges have yet to be laid, police were reluctant to divulge details of the allegations likely to be made against the men, but said they believed the incidents might have been motivated by “religious extremism”.

“Without going into that detail, there are certain respects to the lighting of the fire which leads us to suspect it was a terrorism motivation,” Hermans said.

This morning’s raids were conducted by the joint counter-terrorism team, which includes members from Victoria police, the Australian federal police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

The two incidents had not initially been investigated by counter-terrorism police, Hermans said, but police had received “intelligence” in relation to one of the men which “led us to believe that perhaps [it was] more serious than initially [thought]”.

“We received information that suggested their ideology would be of concern to the Victorian community and as a result conducted investigations into one [person] which led to three [persons of interest],” he said.

Hermans said the 16-year-old was released after his arrest but police would continue to “engage” with him and “offer him support and hopefully divert him away from the act which saw him come to our attention this morning”.

Assistant commissioner Scott Lee from the Australian federal police would not speculate on the case but said generally that the Covid-19 pandemic appeared to have “exacerbated radicalisation for some young people across Australia and the world”.

“It’s a phenomenon we see regularly now with our counter-terrorism, regardless of the ideology,” he said.

“The magnification of the online environment ... that is certainly what we have seen out of the Covid period. People have been driven into the online environment and that has exacerbated some of the radicalisation we have seen.”"

Apropos of nothing, I note that Franklin (Ciaran Hinds) is a man disastrously underqualified for his position as expedition leader. He has succeeded in life through confidence and showmanship and is better at delivering bombastic speeches than listening to reason or executing a plan of action that will save his men. He prefers to be liked than take difficult or unpopular decisions and so seems set to doom the men under his care to unnecessary suffering and death. The enabler of all his weaknesses is his cabinet – I mean, sidekick – Captain James Fitzjames (played with customary elegant malevolence by Tobias Menzies).

The only real kink in this perfect analogy to our benighted county’s lockdown situation is that the voice of reason, intelligence and tough decisions that might actually work is the vainglorious leader’s second-in-command rather than a committee of medical and scientific advisers. The ever-magnificent Jared Harris plays Francis Crozier, a dour man disappointed in love, held back in his naval career by his Irish heritage and 10 times the seaman Franklin will ever be. They are stuck in the pack ice because Franklin ignored his advice to play it safe and keep some slack in the unforgiving system.

The dynamics and characters of those in charge and of those they command are impressively dense and detailed. Franklin and Crozier’s relationship – its bonds and its strains – are gradually illuminated via flashbacks to pre-expedition times (dear God, everyone looks so warm and happy and free in their theatres and ballrooms and at their leisurely, non-socially distanced dinners).

The ordinary young lad who suddenly starts vomiting blood at the dinner table and dies by the end of the opening episode is drawn so well that his dying terrors are heartbreaking. You feel his loss as starkly as the doctor (Paul Ready) who tries in vain to comfort him. And then there’s caulker’s mate Cornelius Hickey (Adam Nagaitis), a potent mix of social ambition and street smarts, and a man who can spot another fellow’s weaknesses at a hundred paces. An interesting person to have aboard any ship, let alone the trapped HMS Terror.

You hardly need the horror element that is soon introduced into the mix. In some ways, the tension actually dissipates with the advent of a monstrous bear-cum-angered-Inuit-spirit. Once the creature starts tearing exploratory parties to pieces, there is focus and legitimacy to the fears of the trapped men. But it is surely the sprawling and deepening nature of these fears that provides the true horror for us all. Or maybe that’s just 2021 speaking. Maybe vicious giant bears roaming the icy wastelands were more frightening, and will be again one happy day.

History, horror and much of human life is here, and it’s all done well. However, it never quite catches fire into the blazing glory you might expect from the acting talent involved and the pedigree behind the scenes. The executive producer is Ridley Scott, a man who knows his way around a trapped ship housing a monster keen to pick off its crew members one by gored and bloodied one. It’s directed by Edward Berger, who was responsible for Deutschland 83.

Nor does The Terror live up to the beauty and period detailing of the set design, as it alternates between the claustrophobic interiors of the two vessels and the bright, desolate expanse outside. Maybe it is trying to do too much, or maybe 10 episodes is simply too long to keep sufficient suspense going.

But, assuming you are one who prefers to lean in to a situation rather than escape it via reruns of, say, Scrubs or Brooklyn Nine-Nine, there is much to enjoy here, and you can tick those 10 episodes off whatever mental or actual countdown chart you are keeping during our collective incarceration. Don’t let the bears get you down."

The two ships, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, were the most technologically advanced vessels of their day. But they ventured too far south and by the autumn of of 1846 they were trapped in the ice near King William Island.

They saw no daylight for months on end and to keep track of the days and nights they rang the bell, every half an hour.

The crew's final message before they were wiped out - sent April 25, 1848 - indicated that there were survivors - but, at that point they were abandoning their ships after 18 months trapped in the ice.

The crew left the two vessels north of King William Island and set out on a harsh journey south toward a mainland trading post.

Eventually Sir Franklin, along with all 128 crew members, perished in the Arctic.

Exactly what happened remains largely a mystery, although research suggests the crew resorted to cannibalism and there were reports that their behaviour became erratic and bizarre. The wreckage sites were located in the 2000s.

This mysterious story of the slow demise of Sir John and his crew is compelling enough, but 10-part series The Terror, executive produced by Ridley Scott, adds a terrifying supernatural element.

Sir John Franklin, pictured, perished with his crew

The series, which premiered last night and is available to watch in full on iPlayer, is based on a novel by Dan Simmons in which the crew are stalked across the ice by some sort of monster.

This creature is a metaphor for their madness as they slowly lose themselves to the wilderness.

Ciaran Hinds plays Sir John Franklin, deeply religious and blithely certain that God meant him to map the Northwest Passage and create a short-cut from Britain to the Far East.

Greta Scacchi plays his wife, Jared Harris his mutinous captain and Tobias Menzies - best known as Prince Philip in The Crown - plays the cocky junior officer who thinks he knows it all.

The first episode sees Sir John and his captain debating over two opposing courses of action.

A hint of what is to come is given with the gory autopsy on a young sailor who died of TB.

Could a brooch provide the final chapter in the story of a Fife doctor who perished in the worst disaster in the history of British polar exploration?

The brooch contains the hair strands of Dr Harry Goodsir who witnessed unspeakable horrors and suffering on the 1845 Franklin expedition which ended in cannibalism.

Arctic veteran Sir John Franklin departed Britain in command of two ships, the HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, to seek the fabled Northwest Passage.

Terror and Erebus were abandoned in heavy sea ice in 1848 and the men sought a route to safety across the frozen Arctic on foot.

Every one of them died in the endeavour.

Partial skeleton of an officer was discovered

Twenty-five years later, an Inuit guide led explorers to a spot on King William Island where a shallow grave contained the partial skeleton of an officer.

The remains were sent home to the UK, where the renowned biologist Thomas Henry Huxley wrongly identified them as Lieutenant Henry Le Vesconte.

A new forensic analysis of the skeleton in 2009 – which was buried in the Franklin Memorial in Greenwich – found a likely match in Dr Goodsir.

Michael Tracy, of Chicago, Illinois, one of Dr Goodsir’s closest living relations, has spent over a decade researching the distant medical branch of the family.

The brooch was discovered after documents which are held in the Goodsir archive at Edinburgh University suggested it was held by relatives in Alberta, Canada.

The current owner is Court Mackid who agreed to jointly donate it with Michael to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh.

That was where Dr Goodsir once served as conservator, and where he and two other family members received their professional licences.

Further DNA advances could solve the mystery

The museum will take ownership following the easing of lockdown restrictions with a stipulation it would allow for future testing of the hair samples.

Michael said: “One thought, of course, was to have it tested for DNA, but the risk was too great because of the difficulty of analysing rootless hairs.

“There is only one lab in the world that can currently conduct these tests but due to the backlog it would have taken years to even get the hair strands tested.

“Who is to say what another decade will produce in the continual march of science?

“This brooch tells a story of these individuals and is beyond doubt unique, however, its final story has yet to be told.

“It is my profound hope and wish that the brooch’s content, combined with further advances in DNA technology, will conclusively identify the currently unknown remains interred beneath the Franklin Monument in Greenwich as those of Harry Goodsir.

“No words of mine can adequately express what this would mean to me.”

Dr Russell Porter, author of Finding Franklin: The Untold Story of a 165-Year Search, said the brooch “may be one of the most extraordinary relics of the Franklin expedition that’s never before been seen”.

Michael and Dr Potter are also working with fellow author Tom Gross to write a concise biography on Dr Goodsir and the once illustrious medical family from Fife.

Life and times of a famous medical family

Born in 1819, Harry Goodsir grew up in the East Neuk of Fife at Anstruther Easter, Backdykes, The Hermitage.

He was raised by his father John and mother Elizabeth, along with his five siblings John, Joseph, Jane, Archie, and Robert.

A sixth, Agnes, died in infancy.

Father John, as the local doctor, was well known to both local people and connected with the surrounding estate gentry.

As Harry was growing up, the shores of the Firth of Forth played an important role not only in his upbringing but also in his career.

Walking along its shoreline with his older brother, John, he would collect the abundant marine life in their path, cementing an interest in marine biology for the rest of his life.

His parents played significant roles, with his father encouraging his studies at school while his mother taught him to draw exceptionally well.

Her loss, when he was 21, would have a profound impact on him.

Central to Harry’s career path was the example of his older brother, John, who shaped his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh.

John Goodsir, the great anatomist and pioneer of the study of cell biology, was perhaps the most accomplished anatomist and the most successful teacher of his time.

Harry followed in the footsteps of his successful brother as he succeeded him in 1843 as the Conservator of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Museum.

It was John, who was one of the earliest to bring the compound microscope to Edinburgh, who offered to similarly equip his brother, Harry, if he sent him £10 to cover the cost of the instrument.

Harry was awarded his Licentiate in Surgery in 1840 and immediately set out to work by assisting Dr John Reid in the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, as well as supporting his ailing father’s East Neuk medical practice.

Harry was also a rising pathologist and morphologist in his own right and great things were expected from him.

Harry Goodsir was offered Arctic post by Franklin

Fate intervened for the young doctor and naturalist when he was offered the post of Acting Assistant Surgeon and Naturalist on HMS Erebus, a polar expedition that aimed to chart the elusive maze of Canada’s Northwest Passage and was the only member of the crew not from a naval background.

Michael said: “Harry was thrilled, because now he could immerse himself in marine biology and when the Erebus’s dredges were deployed and brought up various creatures of the deep he was exuberant.

“One has only to read the surviving letters he wrote home to clearly capture an accurate picture of his energetic and enthusiastic sense of scientific enquiry.

“His considerable expertise powers in specimen illustration was demonstrated daily on a table provided for him by Sir John Franklin in his quarters.

“Harry gleamed with joy as one of the first members of the crew to climb on his first iceberg.

“As the ship’s librarian, Harry not only compiled an Inuit vocabulary dictionary, but also closely observed the Inuit peoples’ anthropological characteristics, even to extent of wanting to make casts of their heads and faces.

“When Erebus and Terror were encased in the icy grip of the waters off King William Island and the long encampment began, one can only imagine the utter fear and panic that consumed the minds of the officers and crew.

“Cut-off from external communication, hope of an immediate search and rescue was abandoned.

“Each member of the crew began their slow, painful, march in extreme temperatures, moving ever so slowly in death’s icy grip.

“During these long days and months, death was probably welcomed.

“As for Harry, he may have been one of the last to perish near the Peffer River in the southernmost part of King William Island.

“Given the values with which he was imbued, one feels sure that Acting Assistant Surgeon Harry Goodsir demonstrated a doctor’s deep compassion to relieve the suffering of the officers and crew in such desperate conditions that turned out to be their shared ‘death march’.

“In the face of the extreme weather and with dwindling food supplies, Harry watched as, one by one, as the crew succumbed to a catalogue of illnesses: starvation; tuberculosis; scurvy; pure madness, possibly brought on by lead poisoning; and a resort to cannibalism in an ultimate effort to stay alive.

“Throughout, Harry administered medical treatment, comforted the disenchanted, and reassured the dying.

“No words can adequately describe the absolute bleakness, despair, and pure horror that must have passed through the minds of those gallant men of long ago as they walked to their own personal doom.

“As we all emerge from the long lockdown winter of 2021, imagine the nightmare of trudging through the snowy wastes of northern Canada with almost no food and little hope of survival.

“Rescue is not at the end of a mobile phone but rather a year away.

“In conclusion, it is worth remembering that the tragedy of this once prestigious Royal Navy expedition resulted in the greatest loss of life in the history of polar exploration.

“The immensity of the catastrophe, and subsequent lack of information as to the whereabouts of the dead, had far-reaching consequences on their families.”

Tragedy in the Arctic was shared by 128 families

Michael said the Goodsir family were grief-stricken and never fully recovered.

The tragedy of the Goodsir family was shared equally by the 128 families of the lost crews of the Erebus and Terror, all now shrouded in the snowy wastes of Canada.

“Harry’s life story demonstrates how a local Fife lad with an instinctive quest for natural history could; through his industrious application at primary school in Anstruther Easter, possibly attending Madras College in St Andrews, and the University of Edinburgh, become a naval surgeon and de-facto naturalist for the foremost expedition of his time,” said Michael.

“His self-belief and perseverance in the pursuance of scientific knowledge is an inspiration to us today.

“It is in this spirit that a commemorative plaque was laid near the spot where he perished on King William Island.”

Louise Wilkie, Curator, Surgeons’ Hall Museums, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said: “We are very happy to accept the Goodsir family brooch, kindly donated to the museum by Mr Court Mackid and Michael Tracy.

“Both Harry Goodsir and John Goodsir were conservators to the museum, so it seems quite fitting that the brooch will join the collection that they once worked hard to build and preserve.”

Harry Goodsir is brought to life by Paul Ready in Ridley Scott’s The Terror

Dr Goodsir is one of the leading characters in Ridley Scott’s The Terror which is the latest fictionalised account of the voyage that ended in cannibalism.

Executive produced by Ridley Scott for AMC, the ten-part drama originally aired in the UK on BT TV and is now being shown on BBC Two and iPlayer.

Dr Goodsir is portrayed in the series by Paul Ready who is best known to British TV fans as stay-at-home-dad Kevin in BBC comedy Motherland.

“You felt like you were really part of something,” Ready said of working on the show.

“I don’t know how rare that is, but it felt special.

“He was always in love with the natural world and the environment, and had great hope for people.

“But I think it was the people that let him down.”

One of the greatest maritime challenges

The series centres on the disastrous attempt by the crews of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror to discover a sea route through the Canadian Arctic to the Orient, with both ships becoming icebound in the Canadian Arctic’s Victoria Strait and the entire 129-man expedition perishing.

Reports of the crew turning to cannibalism while they slowly succumbed to disease and starvation scandalised Victorian society.

The Northwest Passage is around 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle and less than 1,200 miles from the North Pole.

In Franklin’s time, finding it was one of the greatest maritime challenges.

But the prize was lucrative as discovering a way through would open up a new trade route.

Explorers had tried – and failed – since the 15th Century.

To get there from the Atlantic meant dodging thousands of icebergs up to 300 feet in height.

From the Pacific was just as tricky with masses of ice pushed into the Bering Strait.

The fabled route captured the imagination of explorers.

Erebus and Terror made their final stop before the Atlantic crossing at Login’s Well, Stromness, Orkney, for water and supplies.

The ships were last seen in Baffin Bay in the Arctic six weeks later and after this they became part of one the enduring mysteries of the age of exploration.

Since the expedition was equipped with three years of provisions, the Admiralty in London did not send out rescue missions until 1848.

Final expedition was sent from Aberdeen

In total, around 50 rescue missions were launched to find Erebus and Terror, and these expeditions covered new ground, added more details to the rapidly evolving maps, and helped define the territory of Canada.

Lady Franklin decided to send out a final expedition from Aberdeen to clear up the great Arctic mystery which set sail on June 30 1857.

Two years later, on King William Island in the Canadian Arctic they discovered written proof of the death of Franklin and later the rest of his team.

It gave the locations of the ships and said that the crews had abandoned them after they became lodged in pack ice.

It wasn’t until 2014 that a Canadian mission, equipped with all the latest marine archaeological equipment, located Erebus.

Terror was discovered two years later."

Individuals on the terror watch list were encountered at the US southern border by federal agents during President Donald Trump's time in office.","rushing, encountered, told, terrorists, southern, terrorist, list, individuals, gop, border, watch, claims, terror, factchecking",terror,Terrorism,"(CNN) Amid a significant increase in the number of migrants showing up at the US southern border, a group of Republican lawmakers spoke on Monday in El Paso, Texas, to criticize the Biden administration's immigration policy.

Among the more notable claims made were comments from GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy, who said that people on the terror watch list were now attempting to enter the US through the southern border.

""They're now finding people from Yemen, Iran, Turkey. People on the terror watch list they're catching. And they're rushing it all at once,"" McCarthy told Fox News. He suggested during a news conference that recently detained individuals on the terror watch list were also coming from Sri Lanka and China.

Rep. John Katko, who was also part of the Republican cohort visiting the border, echoed McCarthy's claim on Fox News Tuesday morning , saying that the US Border Patrol told him they had encountered migrants on the terror watch list.

""I was stunned,"" Katko said. ""And I've never heard that before.""

Facts First: There's no evidence of a sudden rush of individuals on the terror watch list showing up at the southern border. The information that is available is vague and leaves many questions unanswered. That said, it's entirely false to imply a small number of individuals on the terror watch list coming to the southern border is a new phenomenon. Furthermore, it's worth noting that being on the FBI's terror watch list does not mean someone is a terrorist or has proven ties to terrorists.

Here's what we do know:

On Tuesday, CNN's requests to McCarthy's office for evidence supporting his claims went unacknowledged for hours. Then around 2:30 pm, Axios reported that according to an unnamed congressional aide, CBP had confirmed to Congress on Tuesday that ""four people arrested at the southern border since Oct. 1 match names on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database.""

After the Axios report published, a representative from McCarthy's office pointed to it in response to CNN's request for comment. According to the report, one of the individuals was from Serbia and the other three were from Yemen.

On Tuesday evening, in response to the Axios reporting, Arizona Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego challenged the substance of those claims in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, saying, ""There is no correlation from what I'm reading to what Mr. McCarthy and other people are talking about.""

""I actually just had a briefing about 90 minutes ago regarding this issue and none of what I heard in that briefing matches this information,"" Gallego told CNN.

When Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was asked about the reporting during a congressional hearing Wednesday, Mayorkas said individuals on the terror watchlist being encountered at the southern border ""is not a new phenomenon"" and has taken place for years.

The Axios reporting does not clarify when these four individuals were apprehended but says the arrests occurred at some point during the five and a half months between October and March 16. Fox News reported Tuesday that one of the individuals ""was encountered on Jan. 28."" It's also unclear whether the individuals were actually on the list or if their names merely matched those among the hundreds of thousands kept in the database. And it's currently unknown if the four people are still in custody or have been released.

After repeated requests to clarify McCarthy's claim, Customs and Border Protection provided CNN a statement Tuesday evening, which noted that ""encounters of known and suspected terrorists at our borders are very uncommon.""

The watchlist

In an FAQ , the FBI says that anyone they suspect to be ""involved in terrorist activities"" could be on the terror watch list. A DHS official told CNN ""one should not immediately conclude"" why someone is on the watch list.

Most individuals flagged by the watch list attempt to enter the US on planes. Encountering a very small number on the border who are on the terrorist watch list is not unique to the Biden administration.

Individuals on the terror watch list were encountered at the US southern border by federal agents during President Donald Trump's time in office. Furthermore, the number of these individuals encountered at the border in a given year is extremely small and is a very small percentage of the total known or suspected terrorists who try to enter or travel to the US annually.

In January 2019, CNN reported that roughly a dozen non-US citizens who were on the terror watch list had been encountered on the US southern border by federal officers from October 2017 to October 2018, according to an administration official familiar with CBP data.

Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CNN that most years the number of those undocumented immigrants on the terror watch list encountered at the southern border ""is in the low single digits.""

""The numbers are so small it's hard to say anything statistically significant about them,"" Nowrasteh said, noting additionally that not a single American has ""been killed by an illegal immigrant in a terrorist attack on US soil -- that hasn't happened.""

Previous allegations

Republican allegations of terrorists crossing the US southern border are not new.

Amid a wave of migration in January 2019, Trump claimed ""we have terrorists coming through the southern border because they find that's probably the easiest place to come through. They drive right in and they make a left.""

But the then-President's claims of terrorists coming through Mexico were contradicted by his own State Department."

Post August 5, 2019, Islamabad has tried different tricks to remain relevant in Kashmir. However, most of the Pakistani moves have either failed or backfired. But as far as Pakistan-sponsored terror is concerned, it is once again threatening to thwart the desire of the Indian Government to restore normalcy and peace in Kashmir. It is a last-ditch attempt by Pakistan which might fail but, it is certain to succeed in delaying the process of normalisation.

A new wave of terror is emerging in Kashmir with indigenous flavour. Having been recognised the world over as the fountainhead of terrorism and the biggest promoter of cross-border terror, Pakistan is desperately trying an image makeover. It is recruiting locals in order to label its insidious plans against India as home-grown resistance against the atrocities committed by Government forces. The fear of being blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog for terror funding and financing, has also compelled Islamabad to remain a latent promoter of cross-border terror.

The familiar names of terror organisations active in Kashmir, like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), are gradually being replaced by new ones like The Resistance Force (TRF), Lashkar-e-Mustafa, Ghaznavi Force and Al-Badr. Most of these groups are old wine in a new bottle with the majority of the cadre being locally recruited. However, their operational and financial control remains with their bosses in Pakistan.

These new terror outfits are not as well-equipped as their parent organisations and rely mainly on the arms smuggled into the Valley through various means using the over ground network. Local youth are lured into militancy in the name of jihad after being radicalised through social media platforms and venomous speeches of the mullahs and anti-India leaders. They are not being trained in the jihadi training camps in Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK) or Afghanistan but locally in the jungles of South Kashmir and are initiated into terrorism by lobbing grenades at security forces’ pickets or crowded places. The focus is also shifting from rural to urban insurgency, with encounters taking place in and around Srinagar, while Jammu is emerging as another preferred base of these terrorists. Target selection, too, has undergone a change. The earlier modus operandi of large-scale attacks on security forces or suicide attacks on their camps has been given up and the terrorists are now concentrating more on targeted killings and use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Now, instead of azadi (freedom), establishing Nizam-e-Mustafa (Shariya rule) and retaining the monolith character of Kashmir is the main motivator of local terrorists. Minorities and police personnel form the main targets of motivated and targeted killings.

Earlier, the weapons recovered from the terrorists used to be a big proof of Pakistan’s involvement as they either had Pakistani or Chinese markings. To overcome this, Islamabad is now encouraging Kashmiri terrorists to buy weapons from Bihar. Smuggling through tunnels and dropping arms with the help of drones also continue since the supply from Bihar and its transportation all the way to Kashmir is prone to interception by law enforcement agencies. Bihar, also being a major source of arms supply to Maoists active in the ‘Red Corridor’, is not able to meet the full requirement of Kashmiri terrorists. Pakistan’s intention in all this is very clear, it wants Kashmir to remain a flashpoint on the international radar; keep it on the boil; discourage outside investment which is likely to generate employment and wean away the youth from militancy and also create a 1990s-like environment of insecurity among the minorities so that the possible return of Kashmiri Pandits is thwarted. By ensuring that the youth remain unemployed and frustrated, it wants to ensure that the ready supply of fodder to the jihadi cadre is not affected.

An insecure environment will also keep tourists away from Kashmir and hence prevent the revival of the tourism and handicrafts industry, the backbone of Kashmir’s economy. To this end, Pakistan has been successful in selling a narrative of demographic invasion and minimising the Muslim-majority character of Kashmir and promoting the Hindutva agenda of the RSS-backed BJP Government at the Centre. Unfortunately, many so-called nationalist mainstream leaders in Kashmir have been vociferously promoting the Pakistani narrative.

The ‘Deep State’ in Pakistan is not satisfied with indigenous uprising being confined only to Kashmir as this makes its case weak globally. A concerted effort post August 2019 has been diverted towards reviving militancy in Jammu as well. Many sleeper cells have been created and the terrorists are being trained for lone wolf attacks to disturb communal harmony.

There are other reasons for shifting the focus towards Jammu by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Jammu’s location close to the International Border (IB) and its heterogeneous population with close proximity to Punjab — another target of the ISI — provides the ideal breeding ground for militancy. Also, the murders of Kashmiri Muslims by terrorists, both Pakistani and local, have created huge resentment among Kashmiris.

The citizens are not only fed up but are turning against the terrorists and not helping them as much as they used to. They are sharing information about the presence of terrorists with the security forces, as a result of which most of the top commanders have been killed.

Thus, safe havens in Jammu are considered more lucrative. But the latest successes of the J&K Police in capturing top commanders of the TRF as well as Lashkar-e-Mustafa in Jammu have sent shockwaves not only among them but also among their bosses in Pakistan.

Due to a strong anti-infiltration grid created on the Line of Control by the Indian Army, terrorists and their handlers have been preferring the IB sector for infiltration; hence Jammu acts as a suitable base for their further despatch to Kashmir or Punjab. Similar is the argument for smuggling and distribution of narcotics. Hence, Jammu has emerged as an ideal base for narco-terrorism.

Like Kashmir, the ISI also wants to trigger insecurity in the Jammu region so that future investors are discouraged. It has not gone down well with the ISI that the J&K Government is not planning to confine new industries to the Jammu-Kathua belt but is encouraging investors to set up industry in far-flung districts, too.

The new wave of terror in J&K, if not nipped in the bud, may prove costly and damaging, as has happened many times in the past. Surely, our leaders, experts and planners would have learnt lessons from the past and would not let another opportunity for ensuring lasting peace slip away. Terrorism, whether local or imported, is the enemy of peace and jihadis are the enemies of humanity.

Unfortunately, Pak apologists operating in India continue to remain silent and accord their latent support to the madness. They refuse to condemn, name and shame Pakistan or take a firm stand against targeted killings of minorities, quite similar to their response in the 1990s. Only a united approach would lead to elimination of the menace of terror and return of peace.

IS remains the UK's ""most significant terrorist threat"" at home and abroad, the foreign secretary told MPs.

""This is a critical moment,"" Mr Raab said.

""Yes, Daesh's [another name for IS] brand has weakened - it remains, nonetheless, globally recognised.

""In December 2020, the UK Counter-Terrorism Referral Unit saw a 7% rise in the volume of terrorist content online and we can see a worrying rise in the proportion of children and teenagers that are now being arrested for terrorism offences.

""And it was Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Met [Metropolitan Police] who described lockdown and the accessibility of terrorist content online as a perfect storm because terrorists have digital access to those who are probably the most susceptible to extremist narratives.

""So we are tackling Daesh's propaganda head on and I am proud the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] leads on this work on behalf of the global coalition.""

The foreign secretary said the government had ""carried out a range of targeted and effective cyber operations"".

MPs were told that there are an estimated 10,000 IS fighters still at large in Iraq and Syria, with Mr Raab saying: ""Support for Daesh still lingers on in many communities.

""At the same time, while Iraq and Syria remain Daesh's primary focus, it also presents a clear and growing global threat.

""So diminishing Daesh's ability to operate in other parts of the world, including Africa and Asia, must also be a priority for the international community. We must not allow it to take roots elsewhere.

""I can report to the House that on 11 February a coalition surveillance aircraft located a number of Daesh fighters - they were occupying two dispersed encampments on the banks of the Tharthar River, west of the city of Bayji [Iraq].

""Two UK Typhoon FGR4s conducted careful checks of the surrounding area for civilians before carrying out simultaneous attacks using two Paveway IV guided bombs against each group. The bombs hit their targets within the encampments, eliminating the terrorist threat.""

The foreign secretary's update to parliament came as it was revealed that police and the intelligence services had thwarted three terror attacks since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Latest Home Office figures show that the number of arrests for terrorism-related activity fell by 34% in 2020, the lowest level in almost a decade.

However, police said the number of plots disrupted has risen to 28 since March 2017.

Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said she was ""deeply troubled"" to hear that young people were being targeted by IS propaganda.

She asked the foreign secretary: ""Does [Mr Raab] agree that it is appalling that British children in the UK are being groomed to join Daesh? And can he therefore tell me what steps the government is taking to protect children from this threat?""

Mr Raab advised people not to travel to Syria, and added that the UK was working to facilitate the return of unaccompanied or orphaned children ""where that's feasible, where that can be done where there's no risk to security and where practically it can be done"".

He added: ""I won't comment on the numbers, it's obviously very sensitive but I take that very seriously.

""We regard those children as the innocents of the scourge of war and wherever it's safe and possible, we will put our protective arms around them."""

Speaking on the sidelines of the ceremony to commemorate the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism, Cabrita said that the fight against this scourge is a “common challenge” for all member states and that the Portuguese presidency has “clear priorities” in this area.

Cabrita acknowledged that Portugal had not been a priority target of terrorist attacks but that, within the framework of its European responsibility and as it chairs the presidency of the Council of the EU, he considered it to be a common issue.

He listed three priorities in this area, the first being to work together with the other member-states in the European Strategy of the fight against terrorism.

Secondly, the conclusion of the regulatory process on eradicating and eliminating online terrorist contents so terrorist content can be removed from digital platforms in an hour, he added.

Finally, the Portuguese presidency intends to expand the debate on Europol’s new mandate, to strengthen the coordination of this organisation with national police forces.

Europol is a European police service for processing and exchanging criminal information, contributing to the enforcement of EU laws, mainly in the fight against organised crime.

Terrorism fatalities were remembered today at several ceremonies in Madrid, the city that 17 years ago was the target of one of the largest terrorist attacks in history, with 193 people killed.

“We have to be resilient [in the fight against terrorism] without becoming a fortress of security,” Cabrita said, adding that Europe must ensure that new attacks do not occur.

The European Day for the Victims of Terrorism, commemorated on 11 March each year by the European Parliament days after the jihadist massacre in the Spanish capital in 2004, had a central tribute presided over by the kings of Spain.

The 11 March 2004 attacks in Madrid were coordinated, near-simultaneous terrorist attacks against the Spanish capital’s suburban train system three days before the Spanish general elections.

The explosions killed 193 people and injured 2,050. The official investigation by Spanish justice concluded that a terrorist cell inspired by al-Qaida directed the attacks, although that organisation was not directly involved."
