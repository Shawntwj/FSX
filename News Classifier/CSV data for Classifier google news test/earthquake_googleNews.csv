The 6.2-magnitude earthquake caused significant damage to hundreds of homes, a mall, hospital, hotels and government buildings early on Friday and has been followed by more than 39 aftershocks since.

“Soon the central government will rebuild, then for collapsed houses, the government will help for those that were heavily damaged,” Widodo said as he visited the city of Mamuju earlier on Tuesday.

The Indonesian government will give as much as 50 million rupiah ($3,558.72) for the rebuilding of “heavily damaged” houses, while houses with “medium” and “minor” damages will given up to 25 million rupiah and 10 million rupiah respectively.

“We hope that with the help of the central government, the recovery of collapsed houses, economic recovery, recovery of service processes in government and the bureaucracy will also return to normal,” he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, a military official who is part of the country’s official search and rescue joint forces, said that nearly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Mamuju and the nearby city, Majene.

Many of them have fled to Parepare, a neighbouring city more than 250km south of Mamuju and nearly 150km from Majene, the official said.

Straddling the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.

The country’s meteorology agency has warned of continued aftershocks, and the risk of extreme weather in coming weeks.

Indonesia has faced a string of disasters this month, including a plane crash on Jan. 9 that killed all 62 on board, a flash flood in South Kalimantan on Borneo island that killed at least 15, volcanic eruptions and a deadly landslide that killed 40 in Java.

Medan, Indonesia – Villagers in Indonesia’s West Sulawesi are running short of food and water after taking refuge in the hills following a deadly earthquake in the early hours of Friday morning, and fears of aftershocks that could trigger tsunamis.

The 6.2-magnitude earthquake that hit the Majene and Mamuju regencies as many people slept has killed 84 people, with dozens still feared missing and more than 19,000 left homeless.

“We urgently need supplies for babies and children like milk, porridge, blankets and nappies,” Muhammad Ansar Tahir of the Ansor Youth Movement of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Islamic organisation, told Al Jazeera. He says his group has so far identified about 30 makeshift camps in the area.

“[On Sunday,] a pregnant mother had to give birth in a tent in one of the camps.”

Just a day before the quake, a 5.9-magnitude tremor also struck the area, damaging homes and other buildings.

Irlan Suhendra, a 23-year-old economics student, has been in a camp in the mountains on the outskirts of South Tubo Village in Mamuju since Thursday.

“We had actually gone to the camp the night before the first earthquake, but we thought it was safe to go back, so I was sleeping in my home when the second earthquake hit. I woke up and tried to open the front door but the walls were shaking too much and I couldn’t,” he told Al Jazeera.

Finally, when the trembling stopped, Suhendra was able to escape his home with his younger brothers and grandmother. “We were scared of liquefaction like in Palu,” he said.

In 2018, more than 4,300 people were killed or declared missing when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit Palu in Central Sulawesi, turning the ground to liquid mud that swallowed buildings.

Suhendra spent Friday night under a tarpaulin the villagers had brought from home and said that no one was able to sleep due to heavy rain and the fear of aftershocks. They have been in the camp ever since with 44 people sharing four tents. The tents are made up of a single tarpaulin strung between trees and sometimes do not reach the ground allowing rainwater and insects to get inside.

While they have sporadically returned to their homes, which are located about 300 metres (984 feet) away down a steep hill to bring food and gas bottles to the camp, their gas supply has now run out and heavy rain has made cooking or heating water difficult due to the damp conditions.

Suhendra told Al Jazeera that they have so far only received a few provisions from the regional government, such as noodles and drinking water, but are having to eat the noodles without cooking them.

Monsoon rains have battered the island of Sulawesi since Friday, hampering aid efforts and slowing down search and rescue operations. Rain is forecast to continue for the rest of the week.

Ade Chandra, the deputy chief of police in Pasangkayu, North Mamuju, which is a six-hour drive from the epicentre of the earthquake, told Al Jazeera that damage in the local area has made the logistics of delivering aid difficult. “We are bringing in aid through the local port and from Palu. Unfortunately, the road from Makassar is damaged and there are constant landslides,” he said.

“Our focus now is on security in the area and transporting aid. We are focusing on supplying those in the camps with daily necessities and especially baby products like formula.”

‘Digging with our hands’

Groups of volunteers like Tahir have also stepped in to assist with the government response, and said they are focusing on two kinds of support in conjunction with the Disaster Mitigation Agency and the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency: assisting with the evacuation and delivering supplies and donations to the camps.

“We are using heavy machinery in some cases as many of the buildings that have collapsed are several storeys high and are too heavy to lift otherwise. In other cases, we have been digging with our hands to get people out. We have found people with light injuries, heavy injuries and some who were deceased,” he said. “If we find people with light injuries, we direct them to one of the camps.”

Tahir also said that they have received private donations of supplies from local businesses and individuals, and that they were working hard to identify the locations of the various camps to deliver the donations as soon as possible.

As the camps have been erected by local communities and not by the government, it is difficult to locate them all quickly and easily, he said, and volunteers must conduct ground sweeps of the local area.

Suhendra said that his family and neighbours in the camp are “traumatised and still panicked” by the events of the last few days. His village of South Tubo is home to 270 families, who have dispersed to different camps in the mountains. He added that social media hoaxes that have depicted tsunamis hitting the surrounding area have only added to their trauma.

“I haven’t returned to normal yet. I was hit by rocks when I was running to escape the earthquake and they shredded the skin on my legs and feet,” he told Al Jazeera. “I’ve just been using sticking plasters to cover the bleeding.”

While Suhendra was speaking to Al Jazeera, a 4.2-magnitude struck 10km (6.2 miles) away from Mamuju, prompting a flurry of panic in the camp.

With his family and neighbours preparing for their fifth night in the camp, Suhendra said he had a “suggestion” for the government.

“They need to penetrate into the villages. All the aid is centralised in Mamuju City. We need rice and milk for the babies but aid is not getting to us. Our people need help.”"

II. Description of Situation

Major earthquake occurred 2 times on Thursday at 14.35 local time and early Friday morning measuring 6.2 on Richter Scale at 02.28 local time. According to data as of Friday (15/1), at 06.00 WIB (West Indonesia Time) the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said that the type of tectonic earthquake hitting Majene area, West Sulawesi, was of shallow crustal earthquake caused by active fault activity.

The road access to the Mamuju - Majene axis was cut off on Monday (18/1) due to a heavy landslide. The condition of electricity in West Sulawesi after the earthquake has gradually recovered, parts of the area have already been active, and the telecommunications network has also been functioning. BASARNAS and the joint SAR team have identified 90 people killed in the earthquake in West Sulawesi. Efforts to search the victims are still being carried out and are focused on 4 villages, namely: Binanga Village, Rimuku Village, Karema Village, and Simboro Village.

On Saturday (16/1) BMKG stated another aftershock measuring 5.0 on the Richter Scale hit Majene Regency. The following aftershock is expected to reoccur, so that the BMKG asks the people to stay calm and be alert.

The Human Initiative responded to the earthquake in West Sulawesi by deploying a medical team, SAR team, and assessment team to 2 regencies, namely Mamuju and Majene regencies. The response team has carried out rapid assessments at the evacuation shelters of Kayuangin Village, Bambangan Village, Lombong Village and Kabiraan Village, Majene Regency. Meanwhile, a quick assessment of the needs of survivors was also carried out at Karema Village, Rimuku Village, Botteng Utara Village, Mamuju Regency. Based on the results of the rapid assessment, it was found that the refugee tents they are staying could not protect them from rain, and there was very little sleeping equipment (sleeping mats, blankets).

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred at 8:01 p.m. just east of Aromas, near where Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara counties converge.

“At first we thought someone drove into the side of the building,” said Dalton Haines Scrodin, who was working the night shift at the Mobil gas station in Aromas. “I haven’t felt one like that for a long time.”

“There were about three or four customers at the time,” he said. “They all ran outside. It got my heart pumping.”

About five minutes later, a 3.0 temblor was reported in the same area. At least four smaller earthquakes, ranging in magnitudes from 2.1 to 1.4, were reported in the 20 minutes after the 4.2 earthquake.

Social media activity indicates that the earthquake was strongly felt in the four counties near where it was centered, but it was felt in pockets throughout the region. A USGS intensity map indicates that some shaking was felt in the Central Valley and even as far north as Santa Rosa and the Sacramento region.

The larger quake’s epicenter was 4.9 miles underground, according to the USGS, and occurred about half a mile north of Highway 101, in the rural hills near the 101-Highway 156 intersection about 4 miles northwest of San Juan Bautista.

There were no immediate reports of any major injuries or damage.

“I heard the house crackling. But nothing fell,” said Scott Freels, a retired firefighter who lives in San Juan Bautista near the epicenter. “We’re used to earthquakes. I live just a stone’s throw from the fault. But as soon as it hit, my mom texted me and said that was a good one.”

BART tweeted that it was reducing train speeds to conduct track inspections and that riders can expect delays of up to 20 minutes as a result.

The initial quake was the second-biggest earthquake in California this year. A 4.3 earthquake was reported Jan. 2 near Pinnacles National Park.

Two magnitude-4 quakes centered about 50 miles off the coast near Petrolia this week were felt in Humboldt County: a 4.3 on Tuesday and a 4.4 at 10:25 p.m. Saturday."

TOKYO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - A strong earthquake hit off the coast of eastern Japan on Saturday, injuring dozens of people and triggering widespread power outages, but there appeared to be no major damage and no tsunami warning was issued.

The earthquake had a 7.3 magnitude and its epicentre was off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 km (36 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It shook buildings for some time after it hit, shortly after 11:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).

Houses and offices in the capital Tokyo, hundreds of kilometres away, also swayed and shook. No tsunami warning had been issued, the meteorological agency said.

At least two dozen people were injured, according to reports from the Kyodo news agency.

A Reuters cameraman on location in Fukushima said his 10th floor hotel room shook for some time. One man at the hotel was taken to hospital after falling and hitting his head on a door, the cameraman said.

Although injured, the man was still able to walk, the cameraman said.

Television footage also showed broken glass from shop fronts.

Some 950,000 households were initially without power, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told a briefing carried on public broadcaster NHK. The blackouts appeared to be concentrated in northeast Japan, including Fukushima and neighbouring prefectures.

There were no irregularities at the Fukushima Daiichi and Daini nuclear power plants, or at the Kahiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, owner Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (9501.T) said.

The utility also said there was no change in the radiation levels around its plants.

Kato said there were no irregularities at the Onagawa nuclear facility.

The quake hit off of Fukushima just weeks before the 10th anniversary of a quake on March 11, 2011 that devastated northeast Japan and triggered a massive tsunami leading to the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter of a century - one centred at the Daiichi facility.

Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific on Thursday, the US Geological Survey said, sparking a tsunami warning for New Zealand, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and other nations in the region.

The quake struck at just after midnight on Thursday local time (1320 GMT Wednesday) about 415 kilometres (258 miles) east of Vao in New Caledonia at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the USGS.

""Hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within the next three hours,"" the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.

Waves reaching between 0.3 and one metre above the tide level are possible for some coasts of Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu, the centre said.

The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency released a statement telling people in coastal areas to move away from waterfronts.

""We expect New Zealand coastal areas to experience strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore following a magnitude 7.7 earthquake,"" the disaster agency said.

""People in or near the sea in the following areas should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas and away from harbours, rivers and estuaries.""

A map accompanying the statement indicated the affected areas included the far north of New Zealand's north island, the Great Barrier Island east of Auckland and a stretch of coast along the country's east.

The northern parts of New Zealand were the only areas in danger of any tsunami.

Smaller waves were forecast for other nations in the region including Australia, the Cook Islands and American Samoa.

There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7.

The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity.

In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.

At 12:51 p.m. on Feb. 22, 2011, the 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck close to Christchurch city at a depth of 5 km. Although not as strong as a magnitude 7.1 quake which hit the area less than six months earlier, its shallow depth and proximity to the city centre resulted in widespread damage.

Hundreds of people gathered at a memorial wall in Christchurch observed a minute’s silence and flags flew at half-mast.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was time to look ahead with hope for the future of New Zealand’s second-largest city.

“It’s been a hugely difficult decade for this city - at times I’m sure it’s felt impossible,” Ardern said in a speech at the memorial.

“But as we look ahead to the coming decade, I see hope and energy and optimism, and I see Christchurch taking its rightful place amongst New Zealand’s best and brightest cities.”

About 87 people who died in the quake were foreign nationals from countries including Australia, China, Japan and the United States.

The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings and homes in Christchurch, forcing the government to embark on reconstruction projects that continue a decade later.

Several buildings in the city centre remain empty, and some residents are still embroiled in legal disputes over insurance payouts.

The city was also the target of a terrorist attack in March 2019, in which a white supremacist killed 51 Muslim worshippers and injured dozens of others in a mass shooting in two mosques."

Although the U.S. Geological Survey cannot predict where and when future earthquakes will occur, the bureau, along with a team of organizations, helped create a system that can provide vital seconds of warning that an earthquake is happening and shaking is imminent.

The ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning system is a network of sensors that collects and shares real-time information about the magnitude, location and expected shaking from earthquakes on the West Coast to distribution partners who then deliver alerts via cell phones and the internet. Partners can also initiate automatic protective actions such as stopping trains to prevent derailments and closing water valves to protect infrastructure.

ShakeAlert can save lives and reduce injuries by giving people time to take protective actions, such as moving away from hazardous areas and making sure to drop, cover and hold on. ShakeAlert complements existing products from the Advanced National Seismic System that contribute to earthquake risk reduction.

After 15 years of planning and development, ShakeAlert-powered alerts will be delivered directly to wireless devices to more than 50 million people in California, Oregon and Washington, the most earthquake-prone region in the conterminous U.S.

“The rollout of public alerting for ShakeAlert in the Pacific Northwest is a major milestone in the evolution of this critical system and has the potential to provide users with life-saving warnings seconds before they experience damaging shaking in future earthquakes,” Gavin Hayes, USGS senior science advisor for earthquake and geologic hazards, said. “This represents a major achievement for the USGS, the ANSS and for our state and regional partners.”

Earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest

Japan and the Pacific Northwest have almost mirror-image tectonic settings. Both are susceptible to quakes as one tectonic plate slides under another in a subduction zone.

The Pacific Northwest is susceptible to three main types of earthquakes as its underlying tectonic plates build up stress on faults: deep intraslab tremors that occur within a tectonic plate, shallow crustal quakes, and large megathrust earthquakes on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The area can also experience episodic tremor and slip events, which can release energy equivalent to at least a M7 earthquake.

As the Juan de Fuca Plate spreads away from the Pacific Plate and plunges beneath the North American Plate, it’s strained as it’s bent and pulled by gravity into the Earth’s mantle. When the strain builds to a breaking point, earthquakes as deep as 25 to 43 miles (40 to 70 km) can occur within the Juan de Fuca Plate roughly every few decades; these quakes tend to happen beneath western Washington state.

There have been three deep intraslab quakes with magnitudes greater than M6.5 to hit the region since 1949: the M6.8 Nisqually quake on February 28, 2001, the M6.5 Puget Sound quake in 1965 and the M7.1 Olympia quake in 1949.

Shallow crustal earthquakes tend to occur less frequently than deeper intraslab quakes in the Pacific Northwest, but when they do happen they can be more damaging because of their shallow depths and proximity to densely populated cities. Some quakes are so shallow that they can break or deform the ground surface while others are up to 22 miles (35 km) deep and may not be connected to faults that we see at the surface.

The M6.8 to 7.5 Entiat earthquake in 1872 in central Washington and the approximately M7.5 Seattle Fault earthquake 900-930 A.D. are two examples of crustal earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest.

Lastly, the Cascadia Subduction Zone is a 600-mile (1,000 km) long megathrust fault with a history of large M8 to M9 earthquakes. It stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California, and separates the Juan de Fuca and North American plates.

Subduction zone earthquakes are the largest earthquakes in the world and reach magnitudes greater than 8.5. The last known megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest was in January 1700 and was estimated to be M9. Looking at geological evidence, scientists estimate that these great earthquakes have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, which make them likely to happen on average every 400 to 600 years.

Earthquake early warning for the Pacific Northwest

In 2012, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, which is an Advanced National Seismic System regional network operated by the USGS, the University of Washington and the University of Oregon, joined the earthquake early warning efforts that began in California in 2006.

Incorporation of the PNSN into ShakeAlert extended the USGS ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning System across the entire U.S. mainland Pacific Coast, which grew to include support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the City of Los Angeles and the state governments of California, Oregon and Washington.

Sources/Usage: Some content may have restrictions. Visit Media to see details. Karl Hagel and Pat McChesney, field engineers with the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network team at the University of Washington, install earthquake monitoring equipment on the slopes of Mount St. Helens, with Mount Hood in the distance.

Residents in most locations throughout the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, Portland, Tacoma, Newport (Oregon) and Eureka (California) should expect that most alerts they receive will be from nearby shallow crustal and intraslab earthquakes.

The vast majority of these alerts will be for earthquakes smaller than M7. In these scenarios, ShakeAlert users who will experience strong (or worse) shaking should expect warning times of less than 10 seconds after which it becomes difficult to take protective actions because of the intense shaking.

In these quakes, there will be a region near the epicenter where shaking arrives before the alert. People should take protective actions as soon as they feel shaking whether they have received an alert yet or not."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics, a key supplier of automotive semiconductors, said it will restart production at its advanced chip plant in northeast Japan after a quake on Saturday cut power to the facility and shut it down.

A resumption of full output will, however, take a week, which could delay some shipments at a time when customers, particularly carmakers, are struggling with a global chip shortage.

“We will do what we can to ensure there is no disruption to supplies,” a Renesas spokeswoman said.

The 7.3 magnitude tremor off Japan’s northeast coast caused strong shaking at the Naka factory in Ibaraki prefecture, which has the company’s only cutting-edge 300-millimeter fabrication line.

When the Sylmar earthquake rumbled through Los Angeles 50 years ago, on Feb. 9, 1971, the top of the earthen Lower Van Norman Dam melted into the reservoir. No one knows exactly what kept the dam near Granada Hills from collapsing. Was it the number of feet of earthen wall that remained? Was it the duration of the quake, since a few more seconds might have shaken loose the rest of the dam face, unleashing a torrent on tens of thousands of homes below?

That the dam survived has rendered those questions a subject for scientific inquiry rather than the annals of catastrophe.

But what might have been remains part of the mystique that sustains the Sylmar earthquake — formally, the San Fernando earthquake — as the keystone in the long arc of seismic knowledge and the practice of earthquake safety. The quake might not have been the Big One, but it still managed to wake California up to a danger that was largely unrecognized. The modern era of earthquake awareness and preparedness is deeply rooted in Sylmar.

Before then, earthquakes were either removed in time — 1906 in San Francisco, 1933 in Long Beach — or physically distant —1964 in Anchorage.

The 6.6 magnitude earthquake that struck the northeast San Fernando Valley seconds after 6 a.m. not only woke up the city but fixated the nation’s budding seismic community as none had before.

“Los Angeles was the city of the future,” said geophysicist Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Sciences Center. “You had the space-age LAX. You have this modern glistening city and all of a sudden hospitals are being knocked down. It really got people’s attention in many ways.”

The indelible images of Sylmar were the hospitals.

At the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar, two buildings dating to the 1920s collapsed and several others were severely damaged, causing 49 of the 64 deaths attributed to the disaster.

Less costly in lives, yet more startling to engineers and scientists, was the partial collapse of the 4-month-old Olive View Medical Center. Elevator towers tumbled, and the second floor of the 50-bed psychiatric unit collapsed onto the first. Three died there.

No less shocking was the collapse of the soaring, nearly completed overpass from the new Antelope Valley Freeway (Highway 14) to the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) in Newhall Pass and portions of the Foothill Freeway (I-210) interchange, where two men in a pickup were killed.

“There were some structures that people thought were safe that turned out not to be,” Hough said.

The hospital buildings and the freeways, all made of concrete, proved unable to roll with the earthquake’s punches.

“We as an engineering community learned from that, that just having strength was not enough,” said Jonathan Stewart, professor of civil and environmental engineering at UCLA. “You had to have ductility” — the ability to stretch. “The [building] code would essentially produce nonductile concrete buildings.”

Another revelation was the damage to single-family homes, at the time thought to be resilient enough to ride out moderate quakes. They proved helpless when the fault rupture reached the surface, a phenomenon that had not previously occurred in an urban earthquake.

California Full Coverage: 50 years after the Sylmar earthquake The Times recalls how the quake that rumbled through L.A. on Feb. 9, 1971, woke California up to a largely unfamiliar danger.

“It would go through people’s lawns, it would go through homes,” said Tim Dawson, engineering geologist with the California Geological Survey. “It would torque the buildings. That was the recognition of that earthquake, ‘Oh, we shouldn’t be building on top of faults that can rupture the surface.’”

For the seismic community, the near debacle of the Lower Van Norman Dam, causing no loss of life but forcing the evacuation of 80,000 people, was the most frightening lesson.

“This was a big one because people started to realize you could have killed 100,000 people if that dam had cut loose,” said acting state geologist Steve Bohlen.

Luck may have played a part. The water level had been lowered 10 feet in 1967 after an evaluation had raised doubt about its stability.

“It was very close,” Bohlen said. “Had the shaking gone on for maybe another five seconds or 10, it could have been horrific. It galvanized both the state and the federal government.”

The near catastrophe led the California Division of Safety of Dams, an agency created after the 1928 failure of the St. Francis Dam, to tighten its standards to include liquefaction, resulting in dams across the state being retrofitted.

Within two years, the California Legislature responded with laws championed by state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist that required earthquake zones to be mapped and set new design standards for hospitals. The mapping law was later enhanced to include landslide and liquefaction zones.

“These two acts and the mapping that followed by California Geological Survey has been a very good thing for California,” said Stewart, the UCLA professor. “It forces us to be real about the hazards. You can’t just ignore it.”

Congress reacted, too, creating the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in 1977. Until then, despite pressure from the seismic community, the U.S. Geological Survey had no program focused on risk reduction, Hough said.

Before that, universities had placed seismometers around the world to record nuclear explosions.

“Now we’re used to USGS being the preeminent agency,” Hough said. “Early warning systems, everything we know, resources and products really started with” the earthquake reduction program.

The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was founded by the state Legislature in 1972. Hundreds of new sensors have been added to advance seismic knowledge, inform building codes and help in emergency response.

Recordings from the handful of sensors scattered around Southern California at the time of the earthquake made another thing clear: Ground accelerations, the key force that buildings must resist, were far greater than seismologists had previously thought possible. Building codes would have to be redrawn to accommodate.

It was a slow process not completed until 1978, Stewart said, as researchers studied the damage to understand why buildings failed and what could be done to make them more resilient. “You write papers. It’s only after you’ve reached some degree of consensus that you can have proposals to change the building code,” Stewart said.

Far more than commonly appreciated, earthquakes are attenuated events. They may be remembered for their brief, terrifying moments. But they also send ripples into the future for years and even decades as their lessons work their way into academic literature, laws, building codes and retrofitting programs.

Olive View and the freeway overpasses were rebuilt to higher standards. The Veterans Administration Hospital was eventually demolished and converted to a park. But some of Sylmar’s ripples will continue well into this century.

The Alfred E. Alquist Hospital Safety Act of 1973 was strengthened in each of the two succeeding decades. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the law was amended to require all hospitals to conduct seismic evaluations and make improvements to any buildings that could not survive a major earthquake. They were given a 2020 deadline to comply with the possible extension for some to 2030.

The hazard of older concrete buildings exposed by Sylmar remained a politically taboo subject for more than 40 years because of the high cost of upgrading hundreds of aging and economically challenged structures. After a 2013 Times investigation, Mayor Eric Garcetti reached a compromise solution by requiring retrofits but giving building owners 30 years to comply.

Fault mapping ordered by the 1972 Alquist-Priolo Act has yet to be completed. The most recent addition, boundaries of the Santa Monica fault, was published in 2018. New maps of active faults in San Diego will be published next, said Dawson of the California Geological Survey. Faults on the Palos Verdes Peninsula are still being studied.

“It’s very slow, time-consuming work,” Dawson said. “There’s a lot of detective work. It’s really easy to map a fault out in the hinterlands. It gets a little harder within urban areas. Many of the clues we look for are harder to see once you build over it.”

New technologies — such as aerial lidar imagery, a radar-like sensor based on light — make the work go faster but also expose new faults.

“There’s always more faults to be mapped,” Dawson said.

The 50-year-old quake remains alive in a recent USGS innovation, “Did you feel it?,” a crowd-sourcing website that compiles participants’ questionnaires into maps of earthquake shaking."

(Inside Science) -- Google’s 6200-mile-long fiber optic cable connects Los Angeles and Chile on the world wide web by sending pulses of light through a garden-hose-sized tube covered in metal and protective insulation. Now, researchers are finding ways to use that cable for a new purpose: sensing earthquakes and potentially giving an early warning of seismic waves.

Zhongwen Zhan, a geophysicst at Caltech, said his group has been focused for the past few years on using unused strands of fiber optic cable running under the city of Pasadena, where Caltech is located, to do seismic testing. ""Then I was thinking: This would be even better if you could do it in the ocean,"" said Zhan, who authored research published today in the journal Science.

Zhan and his colleagues figured out that they could use the existing optical telecommunications equipment as sensors -- no extra instruments or cable needed. To do so, they monitored something called the state of polarization -- the orientation of the light as it moves in waves. Under the ocean, it’s easy to spot disruptions to the light pulses because the seafloor environment is so geologically quiet compared to land. The researchers were able to record 30 ocean swell events and 20 earthquakes over a nine-month period in late 2019 and 2020. “The seismic waves shake the cable, bending, twisting, extending it,” said Zhan, which deforms the fiber inside the cable: all signs that a seismic event has happened.

Right now, it’s not possible to pinpoint exactly where along the cable it happened. But in the future, Zhan said multiple cables could be used as sensors, which would allow people to triangulate and pinpoint the location of the shaking. When new cable is being laid, there are also ways to do it that would make this kind of sensing easier.

Cables could provide a window into the world beneath the waves -- 70% of Earth’s surface is water, yet most geophysical instruments are on land. Using existing cables as undersea observatories could improve our understanding of ocean processes, Zhan said. In addition, the cables have the potential to provide better earthquake and tsunami early warning: ""You want to detect and figure out what is happening before the waves hit people, and if you have sensors only on land you are missing a big part of their coverage,"" said Zhan. ""There is really a lot of opportunity here."""

Huge waves triggered by the 9.0-magnitude quake – one of the strongest on record – crashed into the northeastern coast, crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant and forcing more than 160,000 residents to flee as radiation spewed into the air.

Hiroshima nightmare haunts Japan again Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan yesterday (13 March) described the devastating quake and tsunami, which were followed by an ongoing nuclear crisis, as ""Japan's worst crisis since World War II,"" which was when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and the tremor have left survivors struggling to overcome the grief of losing families and towns to the waves in a few frightening hours on the afternoon of 11 March 2011.

About 50 kilometres south from the plant, in the gritty coastal city of Iwaki, which has since become a hub for labourers working on nuclear decommissioning, restaurant owner Atsushi Niizuma prayed to his mother killed by the waves.

“I want to tell my mother that my children, who were all close to her, are doing well. I came here to thank her that our family is living safely,” said Niizuma, 47.

Before setting off for work, he quietly paid his respects at a stone monument at a seaside shrine with carvings of his mother’s name, Mitsuko, and 65 others who died in the disaster.

On the day of the earthquake, Mitsuko was looking after his children. The children rushed into a car but Mitsuko was swept away by the waves as she returned to the house to grab her belongings. It took a month to recover her body, Niizuma said.

The Akiba shrine has become a symbol of resilience for the survivors, as it was barely damaged by the tsunami while houses nearby were swept away or burned down.

About two dozen residents gathered with Niizuma to decorate it with paper cranes, flowers and yellow handkerchiefs with messages of hope sent by students from across the country.

“It was sleeting 10 years ago, and it was cold. The coldness always brought me back to the memory of what happened on the day,” said Hiroko Ishikawa, 62.

“But with my back soaking up the sun today, we are feeling more relaxed. It’s as if the sun is telling us that ‘It’s okay, why don’t you go talk with everyone who came back to visit their hometown?’”

Remembering the dead

At 2:46 p.m., exact moment the earthquake struck a decade ago, Emperor Naruhito and his wife led a moment of silence to honour the dead in a commemorative ceremony in Tokyo. Silent prayers were held across the country.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told the memorial ceremony that the loss of life was still impossible to contemplate.

“It is unbearable when I think of the feelings of all those who lost their loved ones and friends,” said Suga, dressed in a black suit.

At the ceremony attended by emperor and prime minister, the attendees wore masks and kept their distance, and did not sing along with the national anthem to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

“I would like to express condolences from the bottom of my heart to everybody who suffered from the effects of the disaster,” Suga added, reaffirming support for those affected by the disaster.

The government has spent about $300 billion (32.1 trillion yen) to rebuild the region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere. Decommissioning of the crippled plant will take decades and billions of dollars.

Some 40,000 people are still displaced by the disaster.

Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK public TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.

The work to decommission the wrecked Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, deal with contaminated water and solid waste, and make the area safe is immense.

About 5,000 workers pass through gates into the crippled plant each day to pull apart the plant, which still has about 880 tonnes of melted fuel debris in its reactors.

The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), has estimated the project would take decades, while critics say it could take up to a century to return the plant to a usable state.

The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers. Some antinuclear activists are planning demonstrations in front of TEPCO for Thursday night.

Only nine of Japan’s 33 remaining commercial reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.

During damaging earthquakes, a fault can slip a metre or more – more than 20 metres in the 2011 Japan earthquake – within seconds of the event starting.
In the same region as the 2011 great east Japan earthquake and tsunami, the Sanriku earthquake occurred, in AD869.
What can we do to help reduce earthquake risk?
Incorporating long-term evidence can provide a better understanding of the science behind earthquake hazard than using relatively short historical records alone.","fault, faults, better, risk, predicting, need, look, occurred, thousands, earthquakes, earthquake, fukushima, japan, tsunami, hazard, data",earthquake,geophysical event,"Ten years ago, on March 11 2011, a devastating earthquake occurred along part of a fault that scientists believe had not ruptured for more than a thousand years. The quake triggered a tsunami that caused more than 15,000 deaths in Japan, as well as a serious nuclear accident at a power plant in Fukushima.

It’s common for earthquakes to occur along faults that haven’t ruptured for hundreds or thousands of years. This is because rates of tectonic movement along individual faults vary from less than a millimetre up to several centimetres per year. During damaging earthquakes, a fault can slip a metre or more – more than 20 metres in the 2011 Japan earthquake – within seconds of the event starting. It could take hundreds or thousands of years to store enough stress on a fault before such an event occurs.

These long intervals between damaging earthquakes make assessing fault risks tricky, because much of the data informing our estimates of hazard is from historical records dating back hundreds of years at most.

But Earth holds the secrets to millions of years of earthquakes in its rocks. Studying them – and bringing the data together – we can develop a better idea of where the next big earthquake might happen.

We have only been using modern scientific instruments to measure and monitor earthquakes, and recording the data, for the last hundred years or so. Written records of earthquakes go back several hundred years.

But basing hazard calculations on the events that occurred in a relatively short time period – relative to the long-term average time between earthquakes on individual faults – may cause us to miss data from faults that have not ruptured. For example, in the central Apennines, Italy, the 2016 Amatrice earthquake that killed three hundred people occurred along a known fault that hadn’t hosted a historical earthquake.

Historical earthquakes give us clues about what types of earthquake can occur in certain spots. In the same region as the 2011 great east Japan earthquake and tsunami, the Sanriku earthquake occurred, in AD869.

Geological data

There is longer-term evidence, though, that can help. This comes through geologists analysing the physical structures of faults and looking at changes in the shape of the Earth’s surface caused by movements occurring over millions of years. Such data can be used to identify deformation that has occurred through multiple earthquakes over many millennia.

Techniques include tracing the same dated surface, sediment or structure that has been displaced across a fault and using this to measure how much movement has taken place over a time period either measured directly or inferred through relative timing of different geological events.

Read more: Fukushima: ten years on from the disaster, was Japan's response right?

We can also use sediments to identify past tsunamis. In Japan, researchers have found tsunami deposits buried under beaches and along shorelines showing the extent of where past tsunami have reached, giving us clues about their locations and size.

So why is such data traditionally not fully used in hazard and risk calculations? The problem is that such data can be difficult to collect and may not have sufficient detail to show which faults or parts of a fault have moved faster than others. Where it’s possible to obtain relevant and detailed data, it may not be easy for those who model hazards – trying to predict the likelihood of new events – to use.

Bringing the data together

I’m part of a group that aims to fix that accessibility gap, so that those calculating risk can integrate evidence across tens of thousands of years into their models. We’ve formed an international team bringing together those with expertise in collecting primary data on the ground and those with the modelling skills to calculate hazard and risk.

Our first endeavour has been to create a database which brings together our mapping of fault and rates of fault slip in an open-access format. We use this data to identify which faults pose the highest risk at particular sites.

For example, looking at the town of L'Aquila which suffered heavy damage in the 2009 earthquake, preliminary findings show that it’s not just the faults closest to the city that pose a threat. Significant risk comes from fast-moving faults further away like the fault that crosses the Fucino basin responsible for the 1915 earthquake that killed 33,000 people.

What can we do to help reduce earthquake risk? A first step is having good data about hazard and risk so that governments, civil protection authorities, insurers and residents can identify where to prioritise resources.

We can’t currently predict earthquakes – giving exact times and dates of when and where they will occur – and it’s not clear if we ever will be able to with precision.

But, we can provide probabilistic modelling identifying where events are more likely and the highest damage is expected. Incorporating long-term evidence can provide a better understanding of the science behind earthquake hazard than using relatively short historical records alone. As in most geological problems, we need to use every possible clue we can to solve the enigma of earthquake occurrence."

Ten years ago today, Japan was rocked by a magnitude 9 mega earthquake, followed by a giant tsunami, that brought the country to a standstill. The disaster devastated Japan’s northeast coast, killing some 20,000 people and leaving thousands more missing.

Japan was caught off guard by the strongest earthquake ever recorded, which not only traumatized the entire country but also sparked political chaos amid the ruling government’s inexperience in disaster response. That set in motion urgent calls for new standards in disaster preparedness.

The 10-year anniversary of the disaster stirs mixed emotions in Ueno Shigehiko, 52, who was forced to flee with his family to the land-locked prefecture of Saitama, north of Tokyo, after his home and factory in Kesennuma were destroyed. The hard-hit fishing town in Miyagi prefecture was reduced to rubble and almost swept off the map by the tsunami triggered by the earthquake.

Saitama is a home away from home. Ten years after relocating to this sprawling suburban yet urban commuter town for Tokyo, Ueno is still shocked by the change of scenery. “The 10-year anniversary is just one day, but for me I think about it every day. I still wonder why I’m here [in Saitama],” he jokes. “You can’t compare 10 years in Saitama to 42 years in Kesennuma.”

For a fishing town like Kesennuma, the sea is a source of pride. But the ocean also proved the source of the town’s undoing. It was once a bustling fishing port and fish market home to cargo ships, fishing boats and sailors, and famous for tuna, salmon, squid, sea urchin, and bonito.

Ueno was born and raised in Kesennuma. After the disaster of March 11, 2011, he was left to pick the pieces and start from scratch at 42. At the time he owned a business, inherited from his father, that made fertilizer from oyster shells. After the factory was washed away Ueno said he knew there would be no more work in a town dependent on the local fishing industry.

“I never thought I’d be in this position. All the years I had put into that job – it was gone in a blink of an eye and I now wish I had done a job I loved. This is what I tell my two children.”

Ueno is an avid mountain bike rider and he and his wife find joy going on regular trips to the seaside. “The sea can be a scary place but it’s the sea and the mountains that make up Kesennuma,” he says. “It’s what I got used to looking at for 42 years.”

The first time he came to the capital was when he evacuated to Saitama eight days after the tsunami on a government program providing homes rent-free to disaster victims. Until then the closest he had ever come to Tokyo was during middle school when he went to Tokyo Disneyland shortly after its opening in 1983. The park is located in neighboring Chiba prefecture, 1.5 hours away from Tokyo.

Unlike residents who are still unable to return to no-go zones close to the nuclear disaster, he says he feels incredibly lucky to have the option to move back. Even so, in spite of Kesennuma’s new disaster-proof housing project on artificially elevated land completed in 2019, Ueno says the town will never be the same again unless its fishing and seafood industry bounces back. With depopulation worsening in Kesennuma and rural Japan in general he has doubts the new housing will be enough to encourage residents to return.

Despite these revitalization efforts Ueno says Kesennuma’s landscape still remains unrecognizable. “The town has not recovered at all. I’ve gone back many times and there’s a seawall now, but it’s still not a town yet. On TV I saw some images of revitalization, but it’s only a small part that’s developing. I feel sad that I don’t have a hometown to go back to and enjoy a cooked homemade meal.”

He is now a homeowner in Saitama, which was partially subsidized by the local government. But it’s a world away from the life he built in Kesennuma. “There’s no job to go back to and in Saitama I didn’t really know anyone and don’t have any family here.”

The disaster is still a sensitive topic and his family still carries scars that they’d rather not talk about. “For many years we just didn’t talk about it and actually even now we don’t really talk about it,” he says. “My children refuse to watch television and news reports on the disaster.”

While he doesn’t want the world to forget, every anniversary continues to be a painful reminder. Ueno says he and his wife can’t help but get emotional when they see footage of the disaster. “Even yesterday when I turned on the TV I couldn’t stop crying and my wife too. “

Ueno doesn’t carry resentment, but if he could change one thing it would be ensuring telephones are operational immediately after a massive disaster to prevent people from making risky decisions in the absence of information. “Building a high seawall is well and good but if there only had been a way to communicate… because after the earthquake some worried mothers rushed to pick up their kids from preschool without knowing they had already fled to higher ground. Many died en route.”

Immediately after the quake, 2.5 million households were without electricity. With power lines washed away, power plants flooded, and towns surrounded by water, evacuation centers were cut off from the outside world. “For many days we had no food, no bedding, no electricity and no information,” he remembers. “For almost a week I didn’t even know about the nuclear disaster at Fukushima Daiichi.”

Over the last 10 years he says he has learnt about the importance of memorials and the need to bring visitors to help the town’s revitalization. “There was fierce public debate whether or not to have memorial sites because Kesennuma was never a tourist hotspot,” Ueno explains. “I used to think it was a waste of money and I wanted them to leave but now I understand why they want to remember history because the photos don’t convey the extent of the devastation.”"

That could cause not only major building collapses but serious injuries and death.
For more on earthquake preparation, the Utah State Historic Preservation Office is hosting a virtual event Thursday, 3/18/21 at 6 p.m., available on Zoom or YouTube.","utah, historic, state, major, buildings, prepared, earthquake, damage, magna, salt, preservation, building",earthquake,geophysical event,"It’s been a year since the magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook the Salt Lake Valley. The center was in Magna, but it was felt widely across the Wasatch Front and as far as California.

It was also followed by nearly 2,600 aftershocks, including six ranging between magnitude 4.0 to 4.9.

State estimates found there were upwards of $62 million in building-related damages, contributing to $629 million in total economic losses related to buildings, not including damages to public infrastructure.

State Historic Preservation Officer Chris Merritt said after about three days of surveying the quake’s impact, he and his team identified damage to 145 historic buildings.

In Magna, which saw the most damage, walls and some entire buildings collapsed. In Salt Lake City’s warehouse district west of downtown, some of the biggest brick buildings, such as the Crane Building just north of Pioneer Park, had massive structural cracks running almost the entire height of the walls.

Merritt said the damage was not as dramatic in residential neighborhoods, though that is where danger can be greatest. Chimneys in many older houses in the Liberty Wells neighborhood collapsed, tearing through roofs or landing on cars.

Luckily, though, no one was seriously injured and no major buildings fully collapsed. Merritt credits that in part to preparations made prior to the earthquake, including messaging around planning for natural disasters, building retrofits and quick responses from first responders and other state agencies.

“The preparation paid off,” he said. “But to me, it's like shaking people awake, like we need to keep going. We need to keep investing.”

Researchers estimate there is a roughly 50% chance a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake will hit the state in the next 50 years. That could cause not only major building collapses but serious injuries and death.

Merritt said he worries not enough has been done since the Magna quake to ensure older buildings, particularly unreinforced masonry structures, withstand the next major event.

Much of the problem comes down to cost. He said retrofitting a building could run anywhere from $10,000 to $1 million, depending on the scope of the work and size of the building. While there are grant programs and tax credits available, they are limited.

Steve Bowman, geologic hazards program manager with the Utah Geological Survey, said short of investing thousands of dollars in building upgrades, there are smaller things people can do to prepare. He advised people to consult Be Ready Utah, which can help them come up with an emergency plan. He said it also helps to get to know and plan ahead with neighbors.

“When you do have one of these events that impact your neighborhood, you can really come through it together and not have to do it all alone,” he said.

He said that kind of preparation won’t just help during earthquakes, but any major disaster.

“We’ve never seen so much seismic activity,” says Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO).

“At the moment we’re feeling it constantly. It’s like you’re walking over a fragile suspension bridge,” said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, a lifelong resident in the town of Grindavik.

Grindavik lies in the southern part of the Reykjanes peninsula, a volcanic and seismic hotspot, where more than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred since 24 February – exceeding the total number of earthquakes registered there last year.

Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, Iceland frequently experiences earthquakes as the plates slowly drift in opposite directions at a pace of about 2cm each year.

The source of the past weeks’ earthquakes is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, moving roughly 1km (0.6 miles) beneath the peninsula, as it tries to push its way to the surface.

“We’ve never seen so much seismic activity,” says Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO).

Some of those quakes clocked in at magnitudes as high as 5.7.

“Everyone here is so tired,” says Gudmundsdottir, a schoolteacher. “When I go to bed at night, all I think about is: am I going to get any sleep tonight?”

Many in Grindavik have visited relatives, spent time in summer houses, or even rented a hotel room in Reykjavik, the capital, just to get a break and a good night’s sleep.

Authorities in Iceland warned of an imminent volcanic eruption on the peninsula in early March, but said they did not expect it to disturb international air traffic or damage critical infrastructure nearby.

Unlike the eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes, the eruption on the peninsula is not expected to spew much ash or smoke into the atmosphere.

Experts are expecting lava to erupt from fissures in the ground, possibly resulting in spectacular lava fountains, which could extend 20 to 100 metres in the air.

Already last year authorities put an emergency plan in place for Grindavik. One option includes putting locals on boats in the North Atlantic, if an eruption shuts roads to the remote town.

“I trust the authorities to keep us informed and evacuate us,” Gudmundsdottir says. “I’m not scared, just tired.”"

Known as ShakeAlert, the system will be available to the public’s wireless devices in Oregon starting March 11. Depending on the point of origin of a major earthquake, a ShakeAlert can give residents critical seconds to several tens of seconds of warning to prepare for shaking.

University of Oregon researchers are playing a pivotal role in the science, development and rollout of the technology, which detects earthquakes using about 400 seismic sensors spread across the Pacific Northwest and more than a thousand up and down the West Coast. The system will eventually span the entire West Coast. It launched in California in 2019, and Washington will launch ShakeAlert in May.

West coast members of Congress have led the effort to jump-start funding for ShakeAlert. Over the last several years, Congress has provided more than $25 million per year for operations and infrastructure to the U.S. Geological Survey, which leads ShakeAlert.

Oregon recently awarded $7.5 million to the UO for the Oregon Hazards Lab to complete buildout of the ShakeAlert system in Oregon by 2023. With the funding, the lab will purchase and install sensors at an additional 83 sites and improve data communications throughout Oregon. The state previously contributed approximately $1 million to enhance Oregon’s seismic network.

ShakeAlert includes a number of university partners, including the UO and the University of Washington, which collaboratively operate the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.

UO geophysicist Doug Toomey heads the UO’s ShakeAlert team. Below, he answers questions about the launch and the new alerts.

Q: What is happening March 11 when ShakeAlert is released to the public?

A: March 11 is the 10-year anniversary of the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and also the first day that Oregonians will be able to receive wireless earthquake early warnings, or ShakeAlerts. This is a monumental achievement for the West Coast of the United States, for the state of Oregon, and for the many individuals and groups that are contributing to Oregon’s resilience.

Q: How will the public be notified in the event of an earthquake?

A: The public will receive alerts by all available means, with the primary mechanism in the near future being alerts delivered by wireless devices, such as phones. ShakeAlerts will be transmitted to phones by the Wireless Emergency Alert system as well as apps that can be downloaded. The wireless system exists on all smartphones, and the public may know this as the Amber Alert system.

Provided users have not turned off this alerting mechanism, they can receive ShakeAlerts via wireless alerts.

Q: Are there apps available for ShakeAlerts?

A: The public should also consider downloading and installing apps, and when doing so they should look for those that say “Powered by ShakeAlert.” Android users will also benefit from ShakeAlerts that are integrated into that operating system. It is perfectly fine to have multiple delivery mechanisms on a wireless device. In fact, it may be preferable since alerting times can vary depending on the mechanism.

Q: In what other ways could ShakeAlerts issue warnings?

A: In addition to wireless devices, ShakeAlerts can be delivered by other means, for example sirens, road signs, stoplights at bridges, emergency broadcasts and other methods. For Oregonians to benefit from these diverse alerting mechanisms it is important that the system be adopted and embraced by the public and private sectors, since this will accelerate development of novel and effective alerting technologies.

Q: A few seconds doesn’t seem like much. How can that be beneficial?

A: ShakeAlert can protect the public by giving them precious seconds or tens of seconds of warning before strong shaking arrives from an earthquake. Studies show that when people are caught unaware by an earthquake or natural hazard, their ‘lizard brain’ takes over and they often take actions that are not safe. For example, panicking or running can lead to injuries due to falling or being hit by debris. By giving forewarning of imminent shaking via a ShakeAlert, the public can gather themselves and take protective action.

Q: What should a person do when they receive a ShakeAlert?

A: When someone receives a ShakeAlert they should move to a safe location and duck, cover and hold on to something until the shaking is complete.

At present, ShakeAlerts will warn that an earthquake has occurred and that shaking is expected. The public must be aware that shaking could begin immediately, the next few seconds or perhaps in tens of seconds. Given the range of alerting times, the recommended action is to find a safe spot to duck, cover and hold on.

Q: What can ShakeAlert do to save lives and mitigate damage to critical infrastructure?

A: For several years now the ShakeAlert system has been delivering alerts so that stakeholders could evaluate how to protect critical infrastructure, including water and power utilities and transportation infrastructure.

For example, in San Francisco the Bay Area Rapid Transit system has been slowing trains in response to ShakeAlerts delivered in California. In the Pacific Northwest, water utilities are installing devices that could shut water valves in response to a ShakeAlert, thus safeguarding precious drinking water during and after an event.

Similarly, power utilities such as the Eugene Water and Electric Board are looking at turning off power-generation facilities, such as those at Carmen Smith Reservoir, so that large and expensive turbines are not spinning when strong shaking arrives. Similarly, power distribution facilities, like the Central Lincoln Public Utilities District, are exploring how ShakeAlerts can protect their infrastructure and personnel.

As the ShakeAlert system becomes part of the earthquake culture in the Pacific Northwest, I think we will see many novel lifesaving and infrastructure-saving practices develop over the next several years.

What they’re saying

“A catastrophic earthquake in the Pacific Northwest is not hypothetical. It is a not a question of if an earthquake will happen. It is a question of when. In an earthquake, every second counts. Thanks to the incredible work of the University of Oregon and other West Coast universities, we now have an early warning system that will give people extra seconds to save lives, avoid or reduce injury and mitigate infrastructure damage during a major earthquake.”

—Peter DeFazio, U.S. Representative from Oregon

“If there’s anything we’ve learned from this pandemic and last year’s catastrophic wildfires, it’s the importance of trusting science and preparing for emergencies before they strike. Whether it’s wildfires or The Big One, I will continue to fight for the resources Oregonians need to stay safe.”

—Jeff Merkley, U.S. Senator from Oregon

“When the devastating earthquake hits, our state needs a response that equips all Oregonians with valuable minutes and seconds to protect themselves. I’m proud to have worked with colleagues to secure the funding for ShakeAlert.”

TOKYO (AP) — Ten years after a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeastern coast, triggering meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, much has been achieved in disaster-hit areas but they are still recovering. Numbers show how much progress has been made and what still remains.

9.0 EARTHQUAKE

The magnitude 9.0 earthquake was one of the strongest temblors on record. It struck off the coast at 2:46 p.m. and generated a towering tsunami that reached land within half an hour.

___

18,426 DEAD

The National Police Agency says 18,426 people died, mostly in the tsunami, including 2,527 whose remains have not been found. Local authorities still regularly conduct searches in the sea and along the coast for traces of those still missing. None of the fatalities has been directly linked to radiation.

42,500 PEOPLE HAVEN’T RETURNED

Nearly half a million people were displaced across the northeastern region. Ten years later, 42,565 people, including 35,725 from Fukushima, still haven’t been able to return home.

___

$295 BILLION COST

The government has spent 32 trillion yen ($295 billion) for the region’s recovery, including construction of roads, seawalls and houses, and support for people’s livelihoods. In addition, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the destroyed nuclear plant, says its costs for decommissioning, compensating evacuees and decontamination of radioactive materials outside the plant will total 21.5 trillion yen ($200 billion), though analysts say it could be much higher.

___

2.4% OFF-LIMITS

A decade after the disaster, no-go zones remain in nine Fukushima municipalities surrounding the wrecked nuclear plant. The area accounts for 2.4% of prefectural land, down from more than 10% in the initial no-go zone. Decontamination efforts, such as the removal of topsoil and tree branches and the washing down of roofs, helped reduce radiation levels. But many residents are reluctant to return because of a lack of jobs and continuing radiation concerns.

14 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE

About 14 million tons of radioactive soil, trees and other waste from decontamination efforts across Fukushima are packed in massive numbers of plastic waste bags piled at temporary storage sites. The bags, enough to fill 11 enclosed baseball stadiums, are now being transported to a medium-term storage facility being built in the two towns that are home to the Fukushima nuclear plant. The government has promised to remove the bags from the prefecture in 30 years, but a final repository has not been determined.

432 KILOMETERS (270 MILES) OF SEAWALL

Much of Japan’s northeastern coastline hit by the tsunami has been fortified with enormous concrete seawalls as high as 15 meters (50 feet). All of the walls have been completed except for sections of the eastern coast of Fukushima. When completed, the total length will be 432 kilometers (270 miles). Critics say the walls look like giant fortresses and block sea views, while posing a possible risk of preventing water from flowing back to sea if they are breached by a future tsunami.

___

4,000 NUCLEAR PLANT WORKERS

About 4,000 workers are employed every day at the damaged nuclear plant to help in its decommissioning, which officials say will take up to 40 years, a target critics say is overly optimistic. They are removing spent fuel rods from cooling pools, reinforcing a seawall to protect from future tsunamis, treating radioactive cooling water leaking from the reactors and removing highly contaminated debris.

___

1.24 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WATER

Since the disaster, contaminated cooling water has leaked from the damaged reactor containment vessels into the basements of reactor buildings, where it mixes with groundwater. Much of the water is treated and stored in 1,000 huge tanks now crowding the plant. The operator, TEPCO, says the tanks currently contain 1.24 million tons of water and will be full in the fall of 2022.

In 2020, a subduction zone interface earthquake, the type expected at a subduction zone, occurred on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone to the east of an area called the Shumagin Gap.
However, where the first earthquake occurred, just on the edge of the Shumagin Gap, the subduction zone is locked, and earthquakes have occurred there.
In October 2020, a strike-slip earthquake occurred in the Pacific Plate right in the middle of the gap, which was unexpected.

""The first earthquake that occurred in the Shumagin Islands region of Alaska was the right type,"" said Kevin P. Furlong, professor of geoscience, Penn State. ""The second one was a strike-slip earthquake and that made no sense. That was the part that got us thinking.""

In subduction zones, where two tectonic plates meet, one plate slides beneath the other. If the plates slide smoothly, they are considered unlocked or uncoupled. If the plates hang-up on each other for a time until the forces overcome the friction holding them and then release, causing an earthquake, they are considered locked or coupled. Some portions of a subduction zone can be locked while other parts may be unlocked.

In 2020, a subduction zone interface earthquake, the type expected at a subduction zone, occurred on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone to the east of an area called the Shumagin Gap. This first earthquake happened where other, similar earthquakes occurred in the past.

The Shumagin Gap is an area of the subduction zone considered to be unlocked and where geoscientists assume no earthquakes will occur. However, where the first earthquake occurred, just on the edge of the Shumagin Gap, the subduction zone is locked, and earthquakes have occurred there.

In October 2020, a strike-slip earthquake occurred in the Pacific Plate right in the middle of the gap, which was unexpected.

""There must be a fault in the subducting Pacific Plate, and we can't see it,"" said Furlong.

He explained that in the oceanic crust there are strike-slip faults that develop at the mid-oceanic ridges. This fault in the Shumagin Gap could be a relic of a fault from the mid-ocean ridge, activated in a different way. It appears to be in the correct direction, Furlong added.

To investigate this event, Furlong and Matthew Herman, assistant professor of geology, California State University, Bakersfield, modeled the earthquakes. They also included data from the small tsunami that occurred from the second earthquake. They found that, with the presence of a fault in the subducting plate, the uncoupled nature of the Shumagin Gap made an earthquake there more likely than if the area was coupled. The researchers report their result today (Mar. 24) in Science Advances.

""The potential for unusual earthquakes in these regions makes sense from our computational models,"" said Herman. ""But it is still pretty counterintuitive that making the expected kind of earthquakes less likely actually makes other types of big earthquakes more likely.""

The researchers found that tsunami data was helpful, especially in areas where GPS data were not available. Tsunamis also allow paleoseismologists to look at past events through any deposits left by previous earthquakes. Previously there was no evidence of large earthquakes in this area from tsunami data.

""There are probably other areas that are uncoupled where we assume they are safe from earthquakes, but they aren't,"" said Furlong. ""They are unlikely to have a big subduction earthquake, but they could have a strike-slip earthquake. If there are people in the area, it could do damage with shaking and a small tsunami.""

Furlong suggested there is an increased recognition that there are other ways of generating earthquakes on plate boundaries, and that we need to be a little more forward-thinking when we consider earthquakes on these boundaries.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has determined that a large earthquake — which is expected to occur again in the Pacific Northwest sooner or later — could cause the spillway gates of a dam in Oregon to buckle, resulting “in a potentially catastrophic flood.”

The Corps announced late Monday it will try to minimize the danger by reducing the maximum height of the lake by five feet starting in April. Hundreds of thousands of people, including those in the state capital, live downstream from the Detroit Dam, whose construction in the 1950s created the narrow, nine-mile long Detroit Lake.

The move comes as Oregon and the wider Pacific Northwest are coming to grips with “the big one” that experts say is coming. Earthquakes in the Cascadia subduction zone, which extends from the ocean off Northern California to Canada’s Vancouver Island, have an average magnitude of around 9, making them among the world’s biggest.

A quake in that zone has a 37% probability of happening off Oregon’s coast in the next 50 years, according to Chris Goldfinger, an Oregon State University professor and earthquake geologist.

Just last week, an earthquake early warning system was launched in Oregon. Operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, the state joined California in the system that sends alerts to smart phones. Washington state is expected to join the ShakeAlert system, which operates on an array of seismic sensors, in May.

“When a Cascadia event happens, the critical seconds of notice ShakeAlert warnings provide will save lives and reduce damage to important lifeline systems,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the day it launched, on Thursday.

Lawmakers are also trying to prepare the state for a major earthquake.

In the Oregon Legislature, House Bill 3083 mandates that contracts for public works must adhere to seismic safety standards and seismic rehabilitation standards in constructing or renovating public buildings or critical infrastructure in earthquake-prone areas. A House committee has a work session scheduled for the bill on April 1.

Lindsay Baker, an assistant director of the Oregon Department of Transportation, raised concerns about the bill, saying “there is simply not sufficient funding to fully armor the entire transportation system in a reasonable timeframe.”

But Baker later told the House Committee on General Government she was relieved to hear that the state’s transportation system is not the focus of a new standard for seismic resiliency.

In 2020, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a seismic hazard analysis for Detroit Dam, and found the risk to be higher than Corps officials previously thought.

“Structural analysis has shown a possibility of the spillway gates buckling under the force of a full reservoir during a large earthquake,” the Corps said in its statement. “Risk is high enough to warrant immediate actions.”

A breach would send a surge of water shooting down the Santiam Canyon, which was devastated by a wildfire last summer, and onto where it opens up on the eastern edge of the Willamette Valley.

“Because Detroit Dam is located upstream of many communities including the state capital of Salem, Oregon, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large portions of the narrow North Santiam River canyon and urban areas,” the Corps said in its draft environmental assessment .

Lowering the maximum level is a temporary solution to mitigate the risks and will have little impact, the Corps said. The lake is used for recreation, and most of the boat ramps would be unusable for up to a month.

The Corps said it continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the spillway and other components of the dam to determine if long-term modifications or changes to operations will be necessary. That includes the potential for major reconstruction to address seismic risk.
