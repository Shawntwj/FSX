The interim analysis of the UK trial was based on 62 Covid-19 cases, of which 32 were attributed to the new UK variant.
Four of these cases in the vaccine group were due to the UK variant.
Sequencing data is available for 27 of these 44 cases, and 25 of them, 93%, are attributed to the South Africa variant.
“This is the first Covid-19 vaccine for which we now have objective evidence that it protects against the variant dominating in South Africa.”What comes next for Novavax?","results, novavaxs, africa, efficacy, vaccine, south, exploring, variant, block, republic, islands, uk, covid19, vaccines"

So far, the closest relative to Sars-CoV-2 has been detected in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis in China's Yunnan province - with a genetic similarity of 96.2 per cent.
In another study published as a pre-print pending peer review in January, researchers had also found - in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus shameli in Cambodia - coronaviruses 92.6 per cent similar to Sars-CoV-2.
All three are horseshoe bats from the genus Rhinolophus.
But related species such as the Blyth's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus lepidus) and the Trefoil horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus trifoliatus) can be found here, said National University of Singapore (NUS) mammal researcher Marcus Chua.","causes, rhinolophus, coronaviruses, similar, virus, bats, cent, horseshoe, carrying, china, sarscov2, antibodies, covid19, closely, related, outside, bat"

The Health Ministry (MOH) said the patient, a 28-year-old male Bangladesh national, was confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on April 12 last year and subsequently recovered.
But on Jan 25 this year, his test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection, and he was isolated.
But this is just one element of the human immune system.
But experts say that knowledge about the coronavirus, and how the immune system responds to it, is an evolving area.","virus, spore, recovered, national, say, experts, immunity, immune, system, wanes, called, reinfection, infection, likely, covid19, case, typically"

Since January, the majority of the more than 80 million COVID-19 vaccines available worldwide have gone to only a few high and middle-income countries like US, China, Israel, UK and the United Arab Emirates.
With their vaccination campaigns underway, wealthy nations have also pre-purchased access to supplies that can cover more than their populations.
As a result, high-income countries with only 16 per cent of the world’s population currently hold 60 per cent of the vaccine doses.
RICH COUNTRIES AT FRONT OF QUEUEThis is reflective of the unfortunate cycle that repeats itself during a global pandemic: Rich countries benefit from new health technology first, while poor countries have to wait years or decades for it to trickle to them.","lowincome, countries, million, prolong, vaccination, wait, vaccine, supplies, health, hoarding, crisis, pandemic, world, covid19, vaccines, commentary"

Team member Peter Daszak sounded an upbeat note on arriving at the airport at the end of the four-week trip to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first COVID-19 cases were detected in December 2019.
The visit was never expected to definitively pinpoint the origin of the pandemic – an undertaking that, based on others, could take years.
Here is a look at the theories the team explored during their visit:THE BATSThe mission to Wuhan did not change a major theory about where the virus came from.
Scientists think bats are the most likely carriers, and that they passed it on to another animal, which passed it on to humans.","wuhan, visit, virus, animal, learnt, experts, major, pandemic, passed, likely, covid19, team"
