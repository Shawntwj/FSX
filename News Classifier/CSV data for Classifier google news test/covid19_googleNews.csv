Vaccines that make use of the entire pathogenic virus are called whole virus vaccines. Using a pathogen or a part of a pathogen in a vaccine is a traditional approach, and most vaccines available today work this way.

In contrast, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use genetic material that is chemically synthesized in a laboratory to teach our immune system how to fight off future infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

There are two different types of whole virus vaccines: live attenuated and inactivated.

Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of a pathogen. These elicit strong immune responses but are not suitable for people with a weakened immune system.

In an inactivated vaccine, the pathogen is killed or modified in such a way that it is unable to replicate. It cannot cause disease and is, therefore, suitable for those with a compromised immune system.

The inactivation step usually involves heat, radiation, or chemicals to destroy the pathogen’s genetic material, which stops it from replicating.

Inactivated vaccines can trigger a strong immune reaction, but it is usually not as strong as the reaction that live attenuated vaccines can produce. Due to this, a person may need booster shots to ensure ongoing protection.

The COVID-19 vaccines that Sinovac, Sinopharm, and Bharat Biotech have developed are inactivated vaccines.

Other examples of inactivated vaccines include those against polio, hepatitis A, and rabies.

But how to put the state to work analytically to understand the various experiences of Southeast Asia in managing COVID-19?

Some advanced democracies such as the United States have experienced bitter partisan conflict over the public health response, and in many fragile democracies, populist leaders have downplayed the threat of the virus. At the same time, some democratic governments — from Australia to South Korea — have acted quickly and assertively to combat the pandemic through aggressive testing and contact tracing programs, as well as strict lockdown measures.

Although most of the scholarly and academic commentary on the politics of the COVID-19 response has focused on the advanced industrial democracies, there are important lessons to be drawn from the experiences of Southeast Asia. The figure below charts the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 residents for each of the 11 Southeast Asian countries.

As the data show, some of the world’s most successful governments in combatting COVID-19 are in this region — Vietnam and Singapore, in particular. It also contains some notable laggards, such as the Philippines and Indonesia.

How can we make sense of the politics of Southeast Asia’s COVID-19 experience? And what lessons does this experience hold for the rest of the world? A comparative examination of the Southeast Asian record suggests that party-state linkages are one important factor that explains why some countries were able to manage the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, whereas others were not. The state is certainly not the only factor that matters for understanding why the impact of COVID-19 has been so varied — pandemic management is inherently a complex, multi-level governance challenge — but a focus on the state provides useful analytical leverage for making sense of the Southeast Asian experience.

First, some terminological clarity is necessary. By the state, I mean the political organization with the monopoly on the use of legitimate violence within a given territory. This is Max Weber’s definition of the state. We can distinguish states from political regimes, which are the institutions that allocate political authority within a state, and also from governments, which are the teams of individuals who wield political authority under a particular political regime.

The state is a tricky concept because it is so abstract. Still, for decades, scholars working across the social sciences have invoked the state to understand factors from capitalist development to taxation to repression. Most notably for scholars of Southeast Asia, scholars working on comparative economic growth have focused on the concept of the developmental state as explaining the success of Singapore relative to other capitalist regimes such as Malaysia and Thailand. The state has also played an important role in our understanding of the military and the bureaucracy in countries like Indonesia and Myanmar.

But how to put the state to work analytically to understand the various experiences of Southeast Asia in managing COVID-19? The strongest states have the ability to work with their citizens to accomplish complex governance tasks, as well as the ability to compel their citizens to comply with policy directives — even unpopular ones. Michael Mann called the first of these abilities infrastructural power and the second despotic power.

But not all states possess infrastructural and despotic power in equal measures. To see why, we can focus on two ways in which states vary. First, states vary in their objective physical conditions. Some states cover small and geographically compact territories (Singapore, Brunei). Others cover large and geographically dispersed territories (Indonesia, the Philippines). All else equal, it is easier to deliver services and enforce costly and perhaps unpopular policies in small territories, especially those without distant peripheries that are difficult to administer. A compact geography facilitates despotic power.

Second, and turning to focus squarely on politics, states vary in their relationship to ruling parties. Although states and political parties are conceptually distinct, in some countries the institutional structure of the ruling party is basically coterminous with the state’s administrative and repressive apparatus. In other countries, the two are only loosely related, if at all.

Examples of tight party-state linkages include the Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Singapore. In these two cases especially, members of the ruling party occupy nearly every important position in the bureaucracy, and there are few sources of administrative autonomy. This fusion of the party and the state matters for pandemic management because it gives the ruling party all of the administrative and repressive tools that it needs to implement policies to contain COVID-19, even unpopular and economically disruptive ones. These linkages align the ruling party’s incentives for pandemic management with those of state officials. Tight state-party linkages, for this reason, facilitate infrastructural power.

This fusion of the party and the state matters for pandemic management because it gives the ruling party all of the administrative and repressive tools that it needs to implement policies to contain COVID-19.

Examples of loose party-state linkages include countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Indeed, a firm distinction between the ruling party and state is a characteristic found in perhaps all electoral democracies. In these cases, ruling parties and elected administrations must work with the state’s administrative and coercive apparatus to implement policies. Party elites and elected officials are not part of the same institutional hierarchy as are police and public health authorities. They may have different incentives, and aside from high-level political appointees, party membership plays little substantive role in career advancement. This division between the state and the ruling party is beneficial for ensuring that ruling parties do not become too powerful; but it does undermine their ability to respond quickly and effectively to an acute crisis such as a pandemic.

We can also speak of party-state linkages in countries where partisan competition is highly circumscribed, as in Thailand, or even absent, as in Brunei. Here, the analogue of the ruling party is the ruling junta and the palace. In Thailand, but especially in Brunei, these are tightly linked to the administrative and coercive apparatus of the state itself.

In sum, we can distinguish Southeast Asian countries according to their geographic endowments and party-state linkages. The state in geographically compact Singapore, which has been deeply tied to the ruling People’s Action Party since independence, was well-positioned to respond effectively to the pandemic. Vietnam’s geography is rather less easy to work with than Singapore’s, but the very close relationship between the party and the state gives it substantial infrastructural power. The Indonesian state — a sprawling and politically decentralized archipelago — was ill-positioned to respond to COVID-19. Other states lie between these two extremes.

My emphasis on the state does not imply that government policies and leader choices are immaterial. President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines did not downplay the COVID-19 threat because he lacked an effective and capacious state. Nor did President Joko Widodo in Indonesia vacillate and delay his COVID-19 response because of his state’s geographical complexity and his party’s relative weakness. Nor does an emphasis on the state deny the importance of factors like preexisting health infrastructure, which in the notable case of Thailand has made pandemic management far easier than it might otherwise have been.

But one benefit of a focus on the state is that it helps to situate the successful Southeast Asian cases relative to other successes in the region and beyond. Vietnam and Singapore — like South Korea and Taiwan, as well as Rwanda and New Zealand — monitor health conditions, aggressively sanction their citizens for noncompliance, and coordinate policy delivery across jurisdictions and administrative bodies. But South Korea, Taiwan, and New Zealand do not quite match the strong party-state linkage that characterize Singapore, Vietnam, and Rwanda. It may be that in countries like South Korea, a professional and autonomous bureaucracy provides an alternative to the strong party-state linkages that we see in the successful Southeast Asian cases. Although the specific details may differ outside of Southeast Asia, all of this reinforces the general point that a focus on the state yields useful analytical leverage over the politics of COVID-19."
3,2021-01-07 00:00:00,"Behind the scenes of a COVID-19 contact tracer’s work, tough cases and how TraceTogether has helped",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-contact-tracing-work-tracetogether-moh-435061,"The woman had previously been on stay-home notice when her husband tested positive, Mr Lin said.
Mr Lin said the contact tracing team can relay such requests to different parties working with MOH.
He joined MOH as a contact tracing executive officer last September, before becoming the head of a contact tracing centre three months later.
Singapore has identified three clusters in recent weeks, with Assoc Prof Lee saying they were “certainly a cause for concern”.
“Without such technology to aid us in contact tracing, the contact tracing process will take longer.","understand, really, contacts, tracers, tough, lee, covid19, scenes, tracing, helped, prof, contact, cases, mr, work, lin, tracetogether",covid19,pandemic,"Some patients or close contacts might not want to talk as they think they are in a scam call, in which case the officers can send a formal SMS or email, or encourage them to call the MOH hotline.



“We are not scammers because we don’t ask members of the public for their financial details or to transfer any money to us,” Mr Lin said. “This is something they should be aware of.”



And then there are young patients with parents who are “stressed” about their children being questioned, so they become overprotective, Mr Lin said.



Close contacts in “distress” might also make difficult requests, he said, recalling an incident involving a woman who, after she was put on quarantine in a dedicated facility, requested for a refrigerator to store breast milk.



The woman had previously been on stay-home notice when her husband tested positive, Mr Lin said. Therefore, her isolation was extended and led to “a lot of concerns”.



Mr Lin said the contact tracing team can relay such requests to different parties working with MOH.



“Sometimes they just want to vent their frustrations, so we need to have a big heart and listen to what they want first, and then direct this to the relevant stakeholders,” he added.



THE HUMAN TOUCH



Lending a listening ear and adding a human touch to interviews are skills that Mr Lin brought over from his previous job, as a leading steward for Singapore Airlines.



He joined MOH as a contact tracing executive officer last September, before becoming the head of a contact tracing centre three months later.



This “bigger responsibility” requires him to handle more difficult calls, take on more cases if needed, and oversee his colleagues’ well-being so they are “ready for the work”.



“There are many cases passed to you, so you need to have a bigger picture and understand more stories,” he added. “Initially it was a bit stressful, but that’s okay.”



Mr Lin looked back fondly at one incident when language proved to be an issue during contact tracing. A foreign national spoke some English but could not understand a question.



“We tried to get their details, for example, their birth dates, and they don’t understand what we are saying,” he said. “So what the tracers did was they sang a birthday song. So they understood that we wanted their birthdays.”



Ultimately, Mr Lin said he decided to do contact tracing because he wanted to do his part for Singapore while protecting his loved ones and the community.



“Sometimes we feel like public health detectives,” he said. “It's quite an honour to actually represent the community in doing this.”



IDENTIFYING CLUSTERS



Detectives sometimes take on tough cases, and Assoc Prof Lee said the large COVID-19 clusters linked to two churches early last year were “probably the most challenging” to contact trace.



“It was the first time we really had to put in all the resources and effort, and we had to learn from basics how to actually deal with it,” he said, pointing to the early use of serological tests and attempts to link the clusters.



When it comes to identifying clusters, Mr Lin said the contact tracing teams only identify close contacts of a confirmed case and “don’t really determine a cluster”.



Potential linked cases are rigorously examined by a separate team conducting epidemiological investigations, before senior officials declare them a cluster in official details released to the public.



Singapore has identified three clusters in recent weeks, with Assoc Prof Lee saying they were “certainly a cause for concern”.



“Which is why there have been new announcements in terms of strengthening of some of our safe management measures,” he said, noting that the virus will “always try to exert pressure on us in terms of trying to spread”.

“The main thing is that we do our contact tracing rapidly ... And this is of course made possible by the hard work of the men and women in the contact tracing teams, and also the use of new technology like TraceTogether and SafeEntry.”



Assoc Prof Lee said the key is to get “high coverage” in terms of getting more people to use this technology, so close contacts can be identified even quicker. Currently, more than 80 per cent of the population is participating in the TraceTogether programme.



“We want to really beseech the population to use their TraceTogether app, or carry the TraceTogether token with them at all times when they leave the house, and also to do SafeEntry at all the venues that they go to,” he said.



In January, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan told Parliament that TraceTogether data could be used for criminal investigations, triggering privacy concerns after the Government previously said that the data would only be used for contact tracing.

“We are always concerned if there's any reduction in the use of TraceTogether or SafeEntry, but we hope that people will understand that it is really for their own personal benefit and for the benefit of their loved ones, their friends and people who they may be in contact with,” Assoc Prof Lee added.



“Without such technology to aid us in contact tracing, the contact tracing process will take longer. And every minute more that we spend on contact tracing, means a minute more for the virus to transmit.”

North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world, continues to insist that it has successfully grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, with no coronavirus cases confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic.

According to the country’s state-controlled news agencies, North Korea has taken aggressive measures to contain the virus, such as shutting down its borders with China and banning entry from abroad since China confirmed the first coronavirus cases in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.

While many countries hesitated to close down their borders and cancel flights in the early stages of the pandemic, fearing a negative impact on their economics and thus on the approval ratings of governments, North Korea was not one to think about how to handle the pandemic while causing the least public damage. Its authoritarian system could take whatever measures it wanted to prevent the spread of the virus inside of the country. Its harsh measures led the World Health Organization to report several times that not a single COVID-19 case had been confirmed in the North in 2020.

The North has claimed that a world-class public health system is one of the reasons that it avoided any cases. However, there are no significant developed medical facilities outside of Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Those who are not living in Pyongyang might be suffering invisibly, without their government’s support amid the pandemic.

“Considering the special relationship between China and North Korea, there is a high possibility that a COVID-19 case was found in North Korea before South Korea, but considering the health situation and capacity of North Korea, it is unlikely that the patient was confirmed,” Hwang Seung-sik, a spatio-temporal epidemiologist at Seoul National University. “If the North Korean authorities do not officially acknowledge the confirmed cases, no one knows how serious the situation there has become. A lot of time has already passed.”

China is the North’s biggest trading partner and the primary support for the economy. Given the close geopolitical and economic relationships between the two nations, experts have said it was too late for the North to shut the borders with China after China confirmed the virus in January 2020. There were cases of what was then being called “acute pneumonia” reported in China in late 2019; there were also several suspicious deaths that occurred in the North.

The Economic Toll

Pyongyang’s quick decision to shut the border with China may have prevented a full-fledged COVID-19 disaster, but it has come at a steep cost. South Korean news outlets reported last year that trade between North Korea and China fell 76 percent year-on-year. The biggest drop came in October, when trade was down 99.4 percent compared to the previous year. The information was shared by lawmakers who sit on the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee.

Amid the economic devastation, the U.S. dollar exchange rate in North Korea, which stood at around 8,000 North Korean won per dollar in October 2020, has fallen to around 6,500 won since, which analysts see as suspicious – and unsustainable. In fact, North Korean authorities have issued orders against the use of the U.S. dollar and China’s renminbi and imposed tougher sanctions, including imprisonment, for people caught using those currencies.

Usually North Koreans buy and sell goods in about 500 markets using the U.S. dollar and renminbi rather than the won. But now the North Korean government is restricting the use of foreign currency, presumably in a bid to strengthen control over the market and enhance the value and credibility of the won.

In the aftermath of these currency restrictions, prices in North Korea have increased by several times. The cost of major food items such as sugar and condiments have quadrupled compared to the beginning of 2020.

The COVID-19 Situation

Even though the North says that it has not had a single confirmed coronavirus case, it has not stopped tightening restrictions. Over the past year, North Korea has increased the number of tests and has on occasion locked down entire cities such as Kaesong, Hyesan, Nampo, and Pyongyang, according to the Information Committee lawmakers.

Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has drastically decreased his public appearances, compared to his actions and remarks in past years. Cautious measures to keep Kim safe from the virus should not be necessary if North Korea has not had any COVID-19 cases domestically and has banned entry from abroad.

Despite its claims to the contrary, North Korea’s restrictions and economic data suggest that “it is having trouble with containing the virus and it had already confirmed coronavirus cases,” according to Park Won-gon, a professor of international relations at Handong Global University in South Korea.

“It is unreasonable to say that there is no coronavirus case in North Korea,” said Park. “Considering there was a period of about a month during which China had not clearly revealed information about the coronavirus, even though it confirmed cases in Wuhan in late 2019, more than one coronavirus case must have entered into North Korea, but they might not know.” Park added that the North was actively engaging in trade with China during that time, making the spread of COVID-19 across the border likely.

Amid North Korea’s drastic and harsh measures to prevent the spread of the virus, experts believe that the North’s economic situation is and will continue to be very bad. Beyond negative data from economic indicators, North Koreans are likely suffering from famine and starvation due to food shortages.

Some also suggest that China may be secretly providing aid to North Korea by sea or other routes, but it is doubtful whether North Korea, which has taken a simple but extreme pandemic strategy of blocking every route from the outside world, is actively receiving aid from China.

The South Korean government has publicly said it will provide the North with the necessary aid for its anti-virus activities whenever it needs it, but Pyongyang has flatly refused, saying that it does not need help from other countries.

Last month, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said the coronavirus outbreak had made the North more like its insular self, pointing to the fact that the North had not answered Seoul’s offer of support in the fight against COVID-19. A few days later, Kim Yo Jong, Kim’s younger sister who is also known as the North’s de facto No. 2 leader, reacted harshly and made clear the North will not seek or accept any support from the South.

Based on what Kang and other South Korean officials have said, the South Korean government is seeking cooperation with the North, predicting that there will eventually be confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the North. But experts say Pyongyang will not accept those offers.

“The Moon government wants to kickstart engagement with Pyongyang via health cooperation and donating COVID tests, protective equipment, food and medicine. But for political reasons, North Korea will likely reject aid from the South and rely on China’s discreet assistance,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of Ewha University in Seoul.

For North Korean people, not only COVID-19 but historically devastating floods in August also piled on the misery.

David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, warned about the risk of starvation faced by North Koreans at the September 2020 Korean Peninsula Peace Forum hosted by the Unification Ministry. “Many North Koreans are at greater risk of starvation due to abnormal weather conditions such as drought, floods, and tropical depression,” Beasley said.

South Korea’s Unification Ministry has also suggested that the floods in North Korea were likely worse than in 2007, when the previous worst-ever floods occurred. “In 2007, when the worst flood damage occurred, 500 to 700 millimeters of rain fell for about seven days in North Korea,” said a South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman at a briefing in August. The total rainfall in “August this year seems to be higher than then.”

“It’s a very difficult situation for North Korean people and it’s also very difficult economically,” said Seo Jae-pyoung, secretary-general of a Seoul-based organization of North Korean defectors. “Things made in China are not coming through the jangmadang, [markets] so what people need to eat is not being supplied. For example, soybean oil, sugar, and flour were [imported] from China as they are not produced in North Korea, but they are not being supplied since the pandemic began. As a result, the prices of items in jangmadang have risen a lot and people’s pain is enormous.”

Yet in a bitter irony, thousands of North Koreans rehearsed in Pyongyang for the New Year’s Eve party, according to satellite analysis by 38 North, a website devoted to North Korea analysis. Additionally, the Eighth Congress of the Workers’ Party, one of the most important events in the North, is set to be convened in early January. The North Korean people must provide the goods or money needed for these large-scale events.

Experts say the pain will not end unless the North unveils special measures and alternatives such as economic revitalization through cooperation with the international community or market opening. But these alternatives will not come to fruition under the Kim regime.

“Other countries have taken quarantine measures. But what the North has done since the pandemic began are not quarantine measures,” said Seo, the secretary-general of the North Korean defector organization. “They just blocked [everything] without considering their people’s lives.”"

""I have been looking at vaccines from the early days since February and March, and tracking quite closely. And I feel very confident that the trials have been done very rigorously, the data has been scrutinised by regulatory agencies in Singapore and rest of the world,"" he said.

TWO DOSES PLANNED

He confirmed that Singapore has no plans to ""stretch"" the doses of the vaccines, as the country has procured enough doses for its more than 5 million residents.

In other countries, there has been discussion of giving people ""half doses"", which involves injecting one dose of the vaccine first and possibly forgoing the second dose in favour of inoculating more people.



Prof Tan stressed the importance of getting two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for full protection. Trials have shown that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the only one approved and administered in Singapore currently, has an efficacy of about 95 per cent with two doses spaced three weeks apart.

""It's very important for everyone to understand that full protection only takes place if you have two doses,"" he said. ""There will be people who will get some mild side effects from the first injection - pain, a bit of swelling, maybe even a fever.

""I think we have to be prepared when we have our first shot that there may be some minor symptoms that may last a day or two, so that we don't get put off from coming for our second shot.""

On how long the immunity from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would last, Prof Tan said that studies show protection lasts for three months, but that is because that is the extent of the period of observation.

""I expect that it will be longer than that. Some of the emerging research ... suggests that immunity will last more than six months, eight months. So we think that it's not going to be a very short-lived immunity.""

1. EIGHT VISITORS PER DAY AT EACH HOUSEHOLD

There will be no large family gatherings this year as every household should only receive up to eight visitors each day.

This restriction will take effect from Jan 26 and is aimed at mitigating the risk of large community clusters arising from infections that spread within a household and through them to all their contacts.



People should also limit themselves to visiting a maximum of two other households a day as much as possible, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

The authorities encouraged members of the public to “connect digitally” with their family and friends instead of going on physical visits.

One reason for this? The technology provides a short cut to the manufacturing process, using the human body as the ""factory"".

Before the coronavirus pandemic, no mRNA vaccines have been used commercially.

But two leading Covid-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna now in use in various countries both use this platform, and late-stage trials have shown that they are more than 90 per cent effective at preventing the disease.

Moderna co-founder Robert Langer, a David H. Koch Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will be speaking at the Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS) this week, had earlier said that with traditional vaccines, a large factory is needed to make the protein, or the virus, and it takes a long time to grow them.

But with mRNA, the body is the factory.

""With messenger RNA, the body does all the manufacturing itself so you can create a vaccine much more rapidly which is critical in a pandemic like we have now,"" Prof Langer, 73, told The Straits Times in an e-mail interview.

The virtual summit, organised by Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF), will be held from tomorrow (12 jan) to Friday (jan 15), and will see the world's top scientists and technologists engaging and inspiring over 500 young researchers from more than 30 countries.

Generally, a vaccine works by ""showing"" the immune system an important part of the virus and ""training"" it to recognise and remember a pathogen without exposing the patient to the risk of disease.

But different vaccine technologies go about doing this in different ways.

Traditional vaccines work by injecting a killed or weakened form of the virus into the human body so that the immune system recognises the invader and begins summoning its soldiers - antibodies and T-cells - to get rid of it.

mRNA vaccines like Moderna's, on the other hand, involve injecting into the patient only fragments of the virus' genetic material, instead of the whole virus. These fragments are encased in nanoparticles.

When these viral genetic fragments enter the human cell after injection, they commandeer the cell to begin producing the signature spike protein of the coronavirus.

This trains the body to recognise a key part of the virus - the spike protein - without exposing it to the whole virus.

Explained Prof Langer: ""When injected into the body, the RNA enters cells and the cells make the protein which is the vaccine.

""This contrasts with many previous methods where the protein itself is used, which often takes a year to manufacture.""

The RNA does not enter the nucleus where the cell's genome resides, and is degraded by the cell within a day of the injection, noted an article in the scientific journal Nature last month (Dec)."

Trading restrictions caused by COVID-19 create opportunities for start-ups.

3D-printing, robotics and the internet of things allow for a much more distributed way of manufacturing and operating.

COVID-19 is often linked to its impact on mobility and globalization. Stringent measures have been taken to contain the situation, which have constrained the movement of people and goods, nationally and internationally. The coronavirus pandemic has also accelerated previously existing geopolitical trends, especially regarding trade protectionism associated with, for example, medical equipment, pharmaceutical products and COVID-19 vaccine-related research. This, in turn, continues to feed a techno-nationalist zeitgeist as governments resort to export controls and sanctions in “strategic” sectors such as semiconductors and 5G networks and other so-called “dual use” technologies.

This environment has created an acute demand for new and innovative management tools and systems to support good corporate governance and risk management practices. Governments also need to apply new technologies and tools to better fight COVID-19 and facilitate trade.

The emerging solution to manage the challenges of both COVID-19 and techno-nationalism are coming from a burgeoning new field called TradeTech. The dynamics of the development in this field are captured in the new World Economic Forum report, ‘Mapping TradeTech: Trade in the Fourth Industrial Revolution’.

TradeTech

TradeTech leverages the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, cloud-based platforms and other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to unlock new possibilities and enable transparency and traceability in digital trade and global value chains.

The importance of digital trade has also been outlined in a 2019 paper published by the McKinsey Global Institute titled Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains. Services trade is on a trajectory to outperform global goods trade. The authors of the report write: “In 2017, gross trade in services totaled $5.1 trillion, a figure dwarfed by the $17.3 trillion global goods trade. But trade in services has grown more than 60% faster than goods trade over the past decade.”

Although differences between political and economic systems are on a trajectory of decoupling, and value chains are fragmenting around different standards and values – which will present challenges to TradeTech – there will still be many opportunities to turn this field in a significant growth industry.

Three areas, in particular, offer great promise for the future of TradeTech.

1. Expanding upon existing supply chain technology

Visibility and data-sharing are critical for 21st century supply chain and logistics management. They allow companies to drive efficiencies, resilience and customer satisfaction. The complete end-to-end data, paired with powerful analytics, also enables compliance in export controls, denied parties, restricted entity and data privacy regulations. Advanced technology provides the components to realize innovative TradeTech solutions to bring global commerce to a new level of performance and compliance.

Initiatives such as IATA’s ONE Record in aviation, or the TradeLens data-sharing environment for container ocean shipping – originating from the collaboration between Maersk and IBM – are two initiatives intending to ease data-sharing and raise visibility. The maritime sector is also working on digital standards through the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA).

Global supply chains – rightly and wrongly – have been criticized for their vulnerability to shocks. While many argue that near-shoring is the solution, the reality proves that this is easier said than done. What is certain, however, is that a higher level of visibility is needed regarding the suppliers along the chain, their location, abilities and capacities, the progress of orders and levels of material stocks, as well as the location and condition of goods in transit.

Compliance risk can be mitigated through unique digital trade identities. In a digital world with limited travel, it is hard to know with whom we are dealing. Privately, a Google or Facebook identity can be used across multiple applications. But big businesses need to establish and maintain thousands of profiles, one for each application they wish to use. This comes at a heavy cost and not without risk. While we are lacking a neutral entity that issues standardized and recognized identities for businesses, more reliable product identity technologies have emerged. Start-ups like Evrythng and Santrust, for example, have developed immutable QR codes to ensure authenticity of products.

For some time, export software solutions have been helping companies and employees to increase efficiencies in document processing, execute export licensing and deal with denied parties lists. Compliance and performance traditionally go largely hand-in-hand and many older, well established software solutions will coalesce into new technology ecosystems.

2. TradeTech Ecosystem

The new constraints and risks such as trading restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and techno-nationalism create opportunities for start-ups and innovative companies. A buzzword in the FinTech industry is the term “Reg-Tech”. Major banks are investing in know your customer (KYC), regulatory, and onboarding technology to reduce risk and costs as part of the broader digital transformation agenda.

Blending Reg-Tech into the mix of TradeTech solutions minimizes the impact of regulatory scrutiny, while coping with the changes of procedures, laws and regulations. New export control-driven Reg-Tech involves work being done on microscopic tracking technology that can be placed inside the tiniest of sub-components and components, which then get subsumed within larger machines. These can be used to trace “end use “and “end users” of restricted technologies.

When sovereign interests and our own health is at risk, the stakes for private business are at the highest level. With the expanded use of TradeTech and Reg-Tech, the need for cyber security is also increasing, as the fight against cyber risk and cybercrime is fought with the most advanced and sophisticated “cyber weapons”.

3. Beneficial spillover from TradeTech to other sectors

Data analytics services cut across major parts of supply chain networks throughout the global economy. With their industry-agnostic solutions, data companies drive progress and innovation throughout the world. Specialized companies fill data gaps with their own or third-party sensors and analyze newly created data along with data that is stored in traditional systems like enterprise resource planning (ERP), transport management systems (TMS), and port community systems (PCS). These companies, such as Navis and FourKites are themselves innovators but they also create the foundations for others to innovate on, across all industries.

TradeTech allows for the better management of sites, partners and activities far away. Technologies like 3D-printing, robotics and the internet of things allow for a much more distributed way of manufacturing and operating. While holding the global economy together, they also distribute the grounds for innovation and growth. TradeTech at large is driving many new solutions, ranging from better measurement and reduction of carbon footprints, to enforcement of labour standards, to tools that help to realize the circular economy – a model that fosters the reuse of products and materials to replace the take-make-waste approach.

coronavirus, health, COVID19, pandemic What is the World Economic Forum doing to manage emerging risks from COVID-19? The first global pandemic in more than 100 years, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world at an unprecedented speed. At the time of writing, 4.5 million cases have been confirmed and more than 300,000 people have died due to the virus. As countries seek to recover, some of the more long-term economic, business, environmental, societal and technological challenges and opportunities are just beginning to become visible. To help all stakeholders – communities, governments, businesses and individuals understand the emerging risks and follow-on effects generated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Marsh and McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, has launched its COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications - a companion for decision-makers, building on the Forum’s annual Global Risks Report. The report reveals that the economic impact of COVID-19 is dominating companies’ risks perceptions. Companies are invited to join the Forum’s work to help manage the identified emerging risks of COVID-19 across industries to shape a better future. Read the full COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications report here, and our impact story with further information.

A recent Gartner survey finds that 70% of supply chain leaders are planning to invest in the circular economy in the next 18 months. “Already, 35% of companies believe that digital technology will be a key enabler for their circular economy strategies, but very few are leveraging existing technology for this purpose yet,"" says Sarah Watt, senior director analyst with the Gartner Supply Chain practice.

Sensors and satellite imagery combined with other technologies that provide additional data points can be used to trace carbon footprints, illicit discharge and water pollution, and enforce environmental standards for sustainably-caught seafood. Many of these same technologies can also be used to track controlled technologies, from an export controls perspective, throughout global value chains.

Conclusion

Techno-nationalism, accelerated by the COVID pandemic, has disrupted supply chains and global commerce. But the need to manage new risks brings additional pressure for innovation to the TradeTech field, which, in turn, has spawned new ecosystems of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and businesses. These solutions provide transparency and traceability in supply chains, which facilitate commerce; as well as offering small and medium-sized enterprises the possibility to better connect to the global marketplace."

Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, said on Friday (Feb 19) that the Covid-19 situation has improved but cautioned against easing measures.

Noting that the virus has an ""incubation time"", he said: ""We will monitor one, two, a few weeks after the New Year celebrations and festivities are over.

""If the situation remains stable and under control, we will review and we will consider the measures again and see whether or not there is scope for us to adjust.""

He was speaking to reporters during a visit to a Covid-19 vaccination centre at Jalan Besar Community Club.

Some of the additional measures introduced last month include a cap of eight unique visitors per household per day. Individuals were also reminded to wear masks at all times when outside the home, including when visiting someone else's home.

Enforcement checks have been stepped up during this period, with strict action taken against individuals and business operators that breach safe management measures.

Mr Wong noted on Friday that restrictions had to be tightened after the Christmas and New Year break as the number of community cases rose.

In the third week of January, for instance, there were 21 new cases in the community, up from three the week before.

""We were concerned and therefore, we had tightened up the measures. Since then, the situation has improved, but it's too early to say what happens,"" said Mr Wong.

Events which were postponed earlier due to an increasing number of coronavirus cases in the community, such as the National School Games (NSG), may be reviewed to see when they can be held.

The NSG, which usually sees about 60,000 student-athletes competing across 29 sports, had been scheduled to begin this month.

Thanking Singaporeans for their cooperation, Mr Wong said: ""By all accounts, when I meet people and ask them, everyone has had a much quieter, subdued New Year and they understand the rationale for doing this.""

He added that with the cooperation of Singaporeans, he was hopeful the Republic will not have a spike in cases after the Chinese New Year period."

The private sector can integrate the new digital standard into their verification solutions, said the SNDGG.
“Only this hash is needed to check the authenticity and validity of the digital certificate,” it added.
As of Feb 21, 250,000 people have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to an update from SNDGG.","develops, sndgg, vaccination, digital, singapore, verification, covid19, certificate, test, healthcerts, developed, crossborder, standard, results, solutions, businesses, private",covid19,pandemic,"By scanning the QR code, airline staff members and immigration authorities will be able to check on the authenticity of the digital certificate through a separate platform developed by GovTech.

This platform, called Verify, will check whether the certificate was tampered with and notarised by MOH, said SNDGG.



As of Feb 24, nine companies have been authorised to work with clinics to issue certificates following the HealthCerts standard, it added.

On extending HealthCerts to digital vaccination certificates, SNDGG said the Government is “closely monitoring” international developments on the use of digital vaccination certifications for travel.

It is in discussions with the International Civil Aviation Organisation and various countries on the mutual recognition of such certifications, but these discussions “will take some time as most countries have only just started vaccinations”, it added.

“The World Health Organisation’s current recommendation is that COVID-19 vaccinations should not be imposed as a condition of entry,” said the SNDGG.

HealthCerts relies on an open-source framework known as OpenAttestation, which uses blockchain to issue cryptographically trustworthy documents that can be verified independently without the need for proprietary software or equipment.

Digital documents issued using the framework are tamper-proof, said the SNDGG.

GovTech has also “opensourced the HealthCerts schema, and the code for the issuance, verification, certificate storage and display modules, which facilitates wider adoption by private sector companies or other governments”.

The private sector can integrate the new digital standard into their verification solutions, said the SNDGG. For instance, the Unifier app developed by Temasek-linked start-up Affinidi, which is working with Singapore Airlines in an ongoing trial, can verify certificates issued according to the HealthCerts standard.

SNDGG also said an individual’s data will remain private as only a hash - or digital fingerprint - of the digital certificate is published to the blockchain upon issuance.

“Only this hash is needed to check the authenticity and validity of the digital certificate,” it added.



“REAL STRESS TEST”

COVID-19 has been a “real stress test” for the Smart Nation initiative, said Dr Balakrishnan in Parliament.

""It has exposed gaps. It has validated our investments over the many years and it has also allowed us to differentiate ourselves and to emerge stronger in a post-COVID world,"" he added.

“Many of the solutions that we deployed during the crisis were developed by our in-house engineers within GovTech and other public agencies in weeks, sometimes overnight, over days,” he said.



These solutions include the TraceTogether contact tracing programme and SafeEntry system, which have reduced the time taken to identify and quarantine close contacts from an average of four days to less than 1.5 days.



The former now has 4.7 million users, nearly 90 per cent of Singapore residents, said SNDGG in its media release.

Other platforms such as MaskGoWhere and SupportGoWhere, as well as the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel, were developed rapidly. This ability to “provide crucial, accurate information from trusted sources” enabled the country to respond in a coordinated, effective and calm manner, said Dr Balakrishnan.

One-stop portals were also set up to meet specific needs of people and businesses hurt by the pandemic.

These include the COVID-19 Support Grant application portal, where about 98,000 applications have been approved since its launch in May last year.

Meanwhile, more than 700,000 manpower and workplace applications have been made by businesses through the GoBusiness COVID-19 portal.

GoBusiness, which consists of two other portals providing businesses with help on licensing and navigating Government assistance schemes, will get a new feature in April this year.

A new e-service navigator will be launched to provide businesses with easy access to more than 300 Government e-services, announced the minister.

Dr Balakrishnan also noted that technology will be critical for the safe resumption of people’s daily lives.

Apart from HealthCerts, those eligible for vaccination will be able to book their appointments via the National Appointment System when it is their turn to do so. The public will also be able to view their vaccination records on the HealthHub mobile app.

As of Feb 21, 250,000 people have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to an update from SNDGG.

However, the tiny Himalayan country has yet to use them, preferring a wait-and-watch policy on vaccination.

Authorities in the country of around 750,000 people said it will start vaccinating its citizens in March, once it has enough doses for all those eligible.

Meanwhile, it wants to look out for potential adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines from rollouts in other countries.

But there is another reason for delaying its own inoculation programme.

The authorities in Bhutan also want to avoid launching it during Dana, an ""inauspicious month"" that lasts between Feb 14 and March 13.

This delay in rolling out its vaccination programme is something Bhutan can afford given its efficient handling of the pandemic so far - an unlikely success story despite its meagre financial and healthcare resources.

It has to date recorded a total of 867 cases. There are just four active cases as of Feb 24.

It recorded its first and only Covid-19 death in January this year, around 10 months after it detected its first positive case.

This success has been built on the back of a set of swift and early measures that Bhutan put in place.

It began surveilling visitors for any signs of respiratory illness at the country's only international airport in Paro in January last year, before the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.

And when a 76-year-old American tourist, arriving from India, tested positive for the coronavirus in capital Thimphu on the night of Mar 5 - the country's first case - Bhutan immediately banned the entry of tourists.

Later in the month, those returning from abroad were made to serve a mandatory 14-day quarantine, subsequently extended to 21 days - a week more than what WHO prescribes.

Bhutan has also kept its borders sealed since - a tough decision in a country where tourism is a key driver for economic growth.

It has enforced lockdowns twice, which were not without logistical problems, set up dedicated flu clinics and intensified testing across the country. As of Feb 24, Bhutan has conducted 520,613 tests."

The remaining eight cases were imported cases and had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily update.

No new infections were reported in foreign worker dormitories.

PSA EMPLOYEE VACCINATED BUT LIKELY INFECTED EARLIER: MOH

The PSA employee had received both doses of his COVID-19 vaccination but was likely to have been infected before the vaccine protected him from the infection, said MOH.

The 33-year-old Malaysian arrived in Singapore on Dec 23 last year and served his stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Jan 6. His swab taken on Jan 3 was negative.

The man is a work permit holder who works at PSA as a lashing specialist.

He was asymptomatic and his infection was detected after a test on Feb 21 as part of rostered routine testing and an individual test two days later.

He was subsequently taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases by ambulance.

His serology test result has come back positive but MOH has assessed that this is likely a current infection.

According to MOH, the man received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 22 and the second dose on Feb 14.

""This accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination,"" said the ministry.

""However as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination, he was likely to have been infected before he was conferred protection after vaccination.""

BERRIES TUITION TEACHER

The other community case, a teacher at the Yishun branch of Berries World of Learning School, developed a runny nose on Feb 23 after work, said MOH.

The 27-year-old Singapore permanent resident sought medical treatment at a clinic the following day, where she was tested for COVID-19.

Her test came back positive for COVID-19 on Feb 25 and she was taken in an ambulance to Singapore General Hospital. Her serology test result is pending.

Berries' Yishun branch will be closed until Feb 28 for cleaning and disinfection as a precautionary measure, said MOH.

It's the question hanging over just about everything since Covid-19 took over the world last year. The answer can be measured in vaccinations.

Bloomberg has built the biggest database of Covid-19 shots given around the world, with more than 119 million doses administered worldwide.

US experts like Dr Anthony Fauci have suggested it will take 70 per cent to 85 per cent coverage of the population for things to return to normal.

Bloomberg's Vaccine Tracker shows that some countries are making far more rapid progress than others, using 75 per cent coverage with a two-dose vaccine as a target.

With vaccine manufacturers scaling up production, more people will be vaccinated in a shorter time.

Israel, the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world currently, is headed for 75 per cent coverage in just two months. The US will get there just in time to ring in the 2022 New Year (though North Dakota could get there six months sooner than Texas).

With vaccinations happening more rapidly in richer Western countries than the rest of the globe, it will take the world as a whole seven years at the current pace.

Bloomberg's calculator provides a snapshot in time, designed to put today's vaccination rates into perspective. It uses the most recent rolling average of vaccinations, which means that as vaccination numbers pick up, the time needed to hit the 75 per cent threshold will fall. The calculations will be volatile, especially in the early days of the roll-out, and the numbers can be distorted by temporary disruptions.

For example, New York's target date was briefly pushed out to 17 months this week after a winter blizzard prevented some from getting vaccinated (it's now back down to 13 months). Likewise, Canada's vaccination rate dropped by half in recent weeks following reports of delayed vaccine shipments.

Based on Canada's latest rate of inoculations it would take more than 10 years to reach 75 per cent coverage. That might serve as a wake-up call to Canadian politicians and health officials, but it doesn't mean the country is doomed to a decade of social distancing.

Canada has contracts to buy more vaccine doses per person than any other country, and its vaccination rates are expected to climb. The pace is likely to accelerate further as more vaccines become available. Some of the world's biggest vaccine-manufacturing hubs in India and Mexico are only just getting started.

China, on the other hand, will take 5.5 years to cover its mammoth population, even though it is administering over a million vaccine doses a day.

The situation is more grim in countries like India, Indonesia and Russia, which are likely to take over 10 years to inoculate their populations if they continue at the current pace of vaccinations."

Scientists are exploring ways to use the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology deployed in the COVID-19 vaccines as a way to fight cancer.

Experts say mRNA can stimulate the body’s immune system to recognize cancer cells and attack them.

They note that there are many different types of cancer, so any vaccine would need to be versatile.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.

The messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used in the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines could also be used to tackle cancer, according to experts.

“Cancer cells make proteins that can be targeted by mRNA vaccines. Progress in this area has been reported in treating melanoma,” Dr. Jeffrey A. Metts, chief of staff at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Atlanta, told Healthline.

“However, the treatment of cancer is different than preventing cancer. We can look to the dramatic drop in cervical cancer to see what improved awareness, screening, and administration of the HPV vaccine has achieved in the last 10 years,” Metts said.

“The HPV vaccine has shown that we can prevent 80 to 90 percent of cervix cancers and that is an incredibly effective strategy related to cancer. But it doesn’t treat it,” he said.

Cancer vaccines, however, blur the lines between prevention and treatment.

A traditional inoculation, such as the COVID-19 vaccines, primes the body’s immune system to recognize and attack viral cells.

A cancer vaccine works similarly , teaching the body’s immune system to recognize cancer cells either to prevent cancer from returning or actively seeking and destroying tumors in the body as an immunotherapy.

One reason this works is because mRNA editing is such a flexible technology.

“mRNA can be encoded with any protein imaginable. We can deliver mRNA into tumor cells such that the tumor will express proteins that signal the immune system to attack the tumor cell as a foreign pathogen that needs to be removed,” said Jacob Becraft, PhD, co-founder and chief executive officer of Strand Therapeutics, a company developing mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology.

“We can also deliver mRNA into immune cells, arming them with enhanced sensors for detecting tumors. This effectively teaches the immune system how to kill tumor cells,” Becraft told Healthline.

He added: “Existing therapies require us to create synthetic proteins in the lab that will kill the tumors or activate the immune system against them. With mRNA, we can encode any number of these proteins on the same molecule of mRNA, and cause the tumor cells to ‘create their own therapies’ directly inside of the tumor.”"

By the end of this week, active drivers will progressively receive an SMS with a link for them to book their COVID-19 vaccination appointments, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Tuesday (Feb 23).
The vaccination exercise is a joint effort by the LTA and the Ministry of Health, supported by the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) as well as taxi and private-hire operators.
“As of Feb 14, more than 14,000 public transport workers have received the first dose of the vaccination.
“Vaccination can give our taxi and (private-hire) drivers additional peace of mind by ensuring protection for them and their families,” said LTA chief executive Ng Lang.","workers, taxi, vaccination, privatehire, singapore, covid19, exercise, begins, 50000, dose, national, transport, drivers",covid19,pandemic,"SINGAPORE: More than 50,000 taxi and private-hire drivers will be able to book appointments for their COVID-19 vaccinations from this week, as Singapore progresses with its national vaccination programme.

By the end of this week, active drivers will progressively receive an SMS with a link for them to book their COVID-19 vaccination appointments, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Tuesday (Feb 23).

They can choose to take the shots at any of the vaccination centres, polyclinics or public health preparedness clinics operating as vaccination sites, said LTA.

The vaccination exercise is a joint effort by the LTA and the Ministry of Health, supported by the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) as well as taxi and private-hire operators.

Vaccination efforts for the point-to-point transportation sector began on Tuesday, with about 300 drivers getting their first dose at the site of the former Hong Kah Secondary School in Jurong West. The former school site is now serving as a vaccination centre.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to the centre, Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor said the exercise is part of efforts to offer vaccinations to about 80,000 land transport workers to “strengthen the resilience of essential transport services”.

“As of Feb 14, more than 14,000 public transport workers have received the first dose of the vaccination. And among them, more than 10,000 of these workers have received the second dose of their vaccination, thus completing the full vaccination regimen,” said Dr Khor, who is also the Member of Parliament for Hong Kah North.

She noted that NTA and NPHVA leaders - who are drivers themselves - had set an example by coming forward to receive the first dose of their vaccines, as had senior management from the taxi and private-hire operators.

“Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NTA and NPHVA have been working closely with our point-to-point drivers and tripartite partners to offer a safe commuting experience. They have been maintaining good personal hygiene, upkeeping the cleanliness of their vehicles and practicing safe management measures while ferrying commuters,” said National Trade Unions Congress (NTUC) director Yeo Wan Ling.

“Our drivers also want to do their part in Singapore’s vaccination strategy. This move will further protect them, their families, as well as our commuters,” said Ms Yeo, who is also an MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

“Vaccination can give our taxi and (private-hire) drivers additional peace of mind by ensuring protection for them and their families,” said LTA chief executive Ng Lang.

It will also provide assurance to commuters and contribute to the overall community resilience against COVID-19, he added.

Ms Tammy Tan, group chief corporate communications officer for taxi giant ComfortDelGro, said the firm is glad drivers are being offered vaccinations.

“We are in strong support of the move and have been urging our drivers to sign up - not just for their own health, but for the safety of passengers and their family members too,” she said.

Grab Singapore managing director Yee Wee Tang said the firm will offer drivers an extension of its group prolonged medical leave insurance policy, to cover the potential loss of income should they be hospitalised due to vaccination side effects.

“We will also continue to engage our driver-partners through our driver app to help them better understand the benefits of the vaccination,” said Mr Yee, adding that getting drivers vaccinated is “an important step in helping Singapore move into recovery mode”.

Earlier this month, Grab announced plans to have all of its staff, drivers and delivery riders across the region vaccinated by the end of next year.

Ridership for taxis and private-hire sectors have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis, due to a drop in tourism and many working from home.

In December, the Government announced a S$133 million COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund, which will see about 52,000 drivers receive S$600 per vehicle per month between January and March, and S$450 between April and June this year.

16,2021-02-05 09:40:21+08:00,Data privacy concerns over Thailand's COVID-19 contact tracing app amid new wave of cases,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/transparency-thailand-covid19-contact-tracing-app-mor-chana-297901,"When Mor Chana is active, it records where and when each AID is located and sends the data to the central server.
However, these details are not spelt out in the app’s privacy policy, which currently states it requires the user’s phone number, age and address.
We reviewed these permissions against the functions and purposes of the app,” head of the DPEX Centre and data privacy specialist Kevin Shepherdson told CNA.
“When comparing the permissions used with other Southeast Asian countries’ apps, Mor Chana did not do very well.
This is because our reviewers were unable to verify why these permissions were required – they were not explained in the app’s privacy policy,” he added.","permissions, app, mor, concerns, users, covid19, tracing, apps, contact, cases, risk, privacy, chana, thailands, policy, wave, data",covid19,pandemic,"Mobile phone users who install the latest version of Mor Chana will first be prompted to take a selfie and allow the app to access certain resources necessary for contact tracing such as GPS location and Bluetooth.

The app will then create a QR code for them and complete the installation. This code, according to Julapong, provides them with an anonymous identity (AID) and can only be deciphered by officials from the Disease Control Department using a special tool.

When Mor Chana is active, it records where and when each AID is located and sends the data to the central server. If there is no GPS signal, the app will search for Bluetooth signals from nearby phones and record their GPS locations instead. Users are not required to check-in at individual establishments.

Such data is analysed when COVID-19 patients are identified, along with their past travel history. Health officials can indicate individuals at risk of infection, using their GPS locations and AIDs stored in the central server. They can then proceed to alert the users of the health risk via app notifications.

“The system doesn’t list names but (only) AIDs. So, the doctors won’t know to whom these AIDs belong,” Julapong said.

“If users open the app to check the message, they’ll see a warning from the Disease Control Department that they were in close contact with a risk group at a certain place and time and that they’re at risk and should urgently contact the department.”

PRIVACY POLICY NOT CLEARLY SPELT OUT

Unlike in its earlier versions, Mor Chana no longer requires users to reveal their personal information such as names, addresses or phone numbers. This would mean that the onus is on those identified as being at risk of infection to get in touch with the authorities.

As for its request for a selfie upon installation, Julapong said the photo is only stored on the user’s phone and will be used to prove that they are the owner of the device when reporting themselves to healthcare officials in any potential disease investigation process.

However, these details are not spelt out in the app’s privacy policy, which currently states it requires the user’s phone number, age and address. Moreover, the privacy policy does not provide clear details on who can share the data, simply saying the DGDA may share it with “other relevant authorities” under legal basis in different cases.

For data law experts, failure to accurately and comprehensively declare the app’s requirements and purposes could affect the transparency of Mor Chana as well as the number of active users.

“A privacy policy is crucial to create transparency and trustworthiness for an app,” said Prapanpong Khumon from the School of Law at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.

The specialist in personal data protection laws said a clear and accurate privacy policy is the responsibility of the data controller, who should declare what personal data is collected for use, why it is collected and to whom or which entities it may be disclosed.

Despite previous confirmation by the government about Mor Chana’s data privacy, Prapanpong said its current privacy policy is so broad it “opens a window of possibility” for the personal data to be shared with other parties.

“If the policy could detail clearly which groups or units can access the data, people would have more confidence and understanding in this regard,” he added.

“It’s better than just guessing if that is possible.”



CONCERNS OVER PERMISSIONS GIVEN TO APP

While there were initial concerns over the permissions given to the app, recent software updates indicate an attempt to allow users to be more selective in managing these permissions.

Last year, a data privacy study carried out by the Data Protection Excellence (DPEX) Centre in Singapore revealed that Mor Chana is the most privacy-intrusive contact tracing app among those rolled by six Southeast Asian governments.

In its Privacy Sweep report, the centre reviewed six contact tracing apps developed by the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Data protection experts studied the types of permissions sought by these apps on the Android operating system and whether they exceeded what would be expected based on their functionality. They also assessed how each of the apps explained to consumers why it wanted their personal data and what it planned to do with the data.

“It appeared then that Mor Chana used the most permissions – camera, device and app history, location, microphone, photos/media/files, and phone storage – to perform its functions. We reviewed these permissions against the functions and purposes of the app,” head of the DPEX Centre and data privacy specialist Kevin Shepherdson told CNA.

“When comparing the permissions used with other Southeast Asian countries’ apps, Mor Chana did not do very well. This is because our reviewers were unable to verify why these permissions were required – they were not explained in the app’s privacy policy,” he added."

The 43-year-old Singaporean, who was the country's sole community case reported on Sunday (Feb 7), is employed by BGC Group and works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3.

His job involves issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice outside dedicated facilities and helping them to put on these devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

In response to CNA’s queries, BGC Group said on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing.

“BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively-tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,” said the firm.

“We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.”

MOH said on Sunday that all the man’s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period.

Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and said there were “no breaches”.

The HR company has about 30 people who are actively deployed in shifts at the airport currently. It said its employees who are required to be in close contact with incoming passengers are equipped with face shields, masks and gloves.

“Given that the nature of the job involves potential contact with imported cases, our employees understand the risk factors involved and have to strictly adhere to frequent disinfecting schedules and daily temperature reporting. We clean and disinfect our equipment before and after every passenger is tagged,” said BGC Group.

It added that it is awaiting its vaccination schedule as Singapore progressively rolls out doses to more frontliners, including airport staff.

The HR firm's Changi Airport project has been running since August last year. The 43-year-old confirmed case has been with the company for more than four months, it added.

Singapore introduced electronic monitoring devices in August last year for all incoming travellers serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities. Those aged 12 and below are exempted from this requirement."

To date, three main variants have been detected in various countries around the world. The first was identified in Kent, the UK, and is known as B117. The second is known as the South African variant or B1351, while the third emerged in Manaus, Brazil, and is called P1.

Studies have suggested that the two approved mRNA vaccines – BNT162b2 produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, and mRNA-1273 by Moderna – have managed to neutralise both the UK and South African variants. AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which was developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, however, provided minimal protection against the more worrying South African variant.

A laboratory study carried out by the University of Texas found that Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 vaccine could neutralise the highly contagious Brazilian P1 variant. Other studies are underway to figure out if the other two UK-approved vaccines are effective against this newer variant.

The solution: vaccine boosters focused on variants

Although so far both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines have been found to be effective against the concerning South African variant, B1351, the companies both decided they need to be prepared for the future of the Covid-19 crisis by developing vaccine boosters.

In addition, as AstraZeneca/University of Oxford’s vaccine elicited substantially reduced viral neutralisation against B1351, compared to the original Covid-19 strain, the partners also decided to develop a variant booster.

“Vaccine boosters can help tackle the threat of emerging variants by providing individuals [with] immunity against known variants,” explains Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences associate professor of microbiology Dr Eric Yager. “Boosters have been used successfully with seasonal flu vaccines. Receiving the flu vaccine each year can work like a booster to enhance immunity against that flu strain.”

In addition, Yager explains that “by reducing the number of people infected with the original virus and those infected with the variants, we can reduce the occurrence of additional variants”. This is because variants are created in people infected with Covid-19, and “fewer infected people means fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate, which in turn means fewer future variants”.

Vaccine manufacturers get to work on variant boosters

In late February, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they were developing a new vaccine targeting the B1351 variant. BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin explained that his company’s proprietary mRNA platform is flexible enough to allow boosters to be developed in weeks.

Pfizer CEO and chairman Albert Bourla noted in a release: “While we have not seen any evidence that the circulating variants result in a loss of protection provided by our vaccine, we are taking multiple steps to act decisively and be ready in case a strain becomes resistant to the protection afforded by the vaccine.

“We are making the right investments and engaging in the appropriate conversations with regulators to help position us to potentially develop and seek authorisation for an updated mRNA vaccine or booster if needed.”

Similarly, despite being confident its vaccine will be effective against not only the UK and South African variants, but also the emerging Brazilian variant, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel announced in late January: “Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in…South Africa into the clinic to determine if it will be more effective to boost titres against this and potentially future variants.”

Moderna’s variant booster candidate focused on the South African variant, which is known as mRNA-1273.351, has been shipped to the US National Institutes of Health for Phase I studies to begin.

The company is also developing a multivalent booster candidate that combines its original vaccine mRNA-1273 and the booster, mRNA-1273.351 into a single shot known as mRNA-1273.211. Yager explains the benefit of a multivalent booster approach is “it would produce protection against known emerging variants and boost immunity against the original virus”.

Finally, the University of Oxford has started developing a second-generation version of its ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine to target Covid-19 variants with mutations similar to B1351.

University of Oxford professor of vaccinology Sarah Gilbert said: “Efforts are underway to develop a new generation of vaccines that will allow protection to be redirected to emerging variants as booster jabs, if it turns out that it is necessary to do so.”

“We are working with AstraZeneca to optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary.

“This is the same issue that is faced by all of the vaccine developers, and we will continue to monitor the emergence of new variants that arise in readiness for a future strain change.”

The need for an existing vaccine booster

Boosters are not only useful in protecting and boosting immunity against new variants. They can also overcome another challenge facing Covid-19 vaccines: declining immunity.

Throughout the pandemic, studies have suggested that individuals’ immunity against Covid-19 wanes over time, meaning it is possible for people to be re-infected with Covid-19. This, in turn, has created concerns about the durability of immune response in vaccinated people.

To alleviate this, vaccine companies, including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are also developing boosters of their original vaccines. This involves simply adding another dose of the vaccine to “re-expose our immune system to an antigen in order to ‘boost’ immunity… after immunity has declined over time”, explains Yager. “Boosters would serve to maintain protection against the original virus and help keep communities at herd immunity.”

Moderna has begun dosing a trial of its existing mRNA-1273 vaccine booster, while Pfizer and BioNTech will be offering US Phase I trial participants the opportunity to receive a third dose of BNT162b2 between six and 12 months after the initial two-dose regimen.

In this respect, Covid-19 vaccines are following in the footsteps of tetanus vaccines, which are administered approximately every ten years to “ensure individuals remain protected against the illness”.

These multi-faceted vaccine booster efforts by pharma companies have been bolstered by the actions of multiple regulatory agencies. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have both published guidance that establish pathways to allow clear, accelerated pathways to approval for the multiple different types of boosters.

Administering vaccine boosters

The pandemic has taught the world that although having vaccines is good, it is only meaningful if those vaccines can actually be delivered and administered to the global population. Once these vaccine boosters are developed, studied and approved, the next challenge is getting them to patients at the right time.

Yager notes the roll-out of boosters will be challenged by the need for “substantial communication to the public [about] why booster vaccines are necessary”. It is also important that this does not contradict or undermine messaging about the safety and efficacy of the existing two-dose vaccine regimes.

Another challenge is knowing when it is the right time to administer a booster. Since everyone is different, their neutralising antibody levels will decline at different rates post-vaccination, explains AXIM Biotechnologies CEO John Huemoeller.

To overcome this, AXIM Biotechnologies is developing a point-of-care Covid-19 test called ImmunoPass. It can rapidly and accurately determine an individual’s level of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the new emerging variants. AXIM is in the process of filing for emergency use authorisation in the US and the idea is that ImmunoPass will be used by a nurse or doctor in their offices to figure out if someone’s neutralising antibodies have declined to a certain point, which means they are in need of a booster shot.

The digital certificate, which shows a user's vaccination status and virus test results, is available for Chinese citizens via a programme on Chinese social media platform WeChat that was launched on Monday.

The certificate is being rolled out ""to help promote world economic recovery and facilitate cross-border travel,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said.

However the international health certificate is currently only available for use by Chinese citizens and it is not yet mandatory.

The United States and Britain are among countries currently considering implementing similar permits.

The European Union is also working on a vaccine ""green pass"" that would allow citizens to travel between member countries and abroad.

China's programme includes an encrypted QR code that allows each country to obtain a travellers' health information, state media agency Xinhua reported Monday.

""QR health codes"" within WeChat and other Chinese smartphone apps are already required to gain entry to domestic transport and many public spaces in China.

The apps track a user's location and produce a ""green"" code - synonymous with good health - if a user has not been in close contact with a confirmed case or has not travelled to a virus hotspot.

But the system has sparked privacy concerns and fears it marks an expansion of government surveillance.

He is Chief Operating Officer of IHH Healthcare Singapore.

His organisation was first brought on for temperature screening at land and sea checkpoints in January 2020. He continued his work as a temperature screener and a medical assessor over the Chinese New Year holidays to fill in for the manpower gap.

Yeo went on to swab and treat Covid-positive patients at the Singapore Expo Community Care Facility. He also took part in swabbing missions at dormitories and nursing homes, and helped to set up swabbing centres. He currently runs vaccination centres as part of Singapore’s national vaccination strategy.

So, what’s it like serving at the frontlines of a pandemic? “Honestly, I was never prepared to work at the frontlines,” Yeo says. He was a 5th year medical student during the 2003 SARS crisis, and news of medical staff dying from the virus had “left me with an emotional scar”.

But remaining focused on the broader goal of eliminating Covid-19 has helped him change his perspective. “I tell myself that all the pressure and stress that I am experiencing now is only temporary and is worth bearing. All this time, I am driven by my desire to ensure that my loved ones and my country stay safe and protected during the pandemic,” he says.

Yeo is also an avid fan of social media, and often uses it to share important information and dispel myths. For instance, he gave daily updates following his vaccination shots and explained the test results that proved his immunity.

“If used in the right way, social media can amplify the goodness and kindness of healthcare; and encourage people to unite and stand in solidarity against Covid-19,” he believes.

The public owes its safety to the brave ones who stood tall in the face of an unrelenting virus. We celebrate the courage and selflessness of the healthcare frontliners who fought on our behalf.

Parties have spilled out on to the streets, children giggle in school playgrounds and beaches heave with families.

With the vast majority of its elderly population already inoculated, and millions more already under the protection of their first jab, the country has made an educated bet to trust in the vaccine.

New infections are down to 3 per cent of those tested, hospitals are emptying and epidemiologists are cautiously optimistic.

If new vaccine-defying variants can be kept at bay, Israel may be the first nation to tame the pandemic and open up its economy for good.

A month after my second jab, I embraced this new normal and invited 30 of my vaccinated friends to a joyful, mask-less party at my house. For more than a week now, restaurants have been jammed, nightclubs and bars are spilling over with joyous revellers and masks, still mandated by law indoors, are quickly vanishing.

“It’s like a thunderstorm after a drought,” said Daniel Lipshitz, 27, chugging beers on a Saturday afternoon in a crowded Jaffa bar.

“No, it’s like sex after being stuck on a desert island,” giggled his friend, Noa, who asked that her last name be printed as “Party Animal”. “Even my grandmother is throwing a party.”

NOT YET FREE OF COVID-19

The initial giddiness aside, Israel has become the test case for what life after the pandemic could look like.

For now, some restrictions remain – no more than 20 people are allowed indoors, for instance, although the rule is largely being ignored. There is also an acrimonious debate on how to manage the return of Israelis stranded abroad for months."

Using molecular dating tools and epidemiological simulations, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, with colleagues at the University of Arizona and Illumina, Inc., estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was likely circulating undetected for at most two months before the first human cases of COVID-19 were described in Wuhan, China in late-December 2019.

Writing in the March 18, 2021 online issue of Science, they also note that their simulations suggest that the mutating virus dies out naturally more than three-quarters of the time without causing an epidemic.

“Our study was designed to answer the question of how long could SARS-CoV-2 have circulated in China before it was discovered,” said senior author Joel O. Wertheim, PhD, associate professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

“To answer this question, we combined three important pieces of information: a detailed understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spread in Wuhan before the lockdown, the genetic diversity of the virus in China and reports of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in China. By combining these disparate lines of evidence, we were able to put an upper limit of mid-October 2019 for when SARS-CoV-2 started circulating in Hubei province.”

Cases of COVID-19 were first reported in late-December 2019 in Wuhan, located in the Hubei province of central China. The virus quickly spread beyond Hubei. Chinese authorities cordoned off the region and implemented mitigation measures nationwide. By April 2020, local transmission of the virus was under control but, by then, COVID-19 was pandemic with more than 100 countries reporting cases.

SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic coronavirus, believed to have jumped from an unknown animal host to humans. Numerous efforts have been made to identify when the virus first began spreading among humans, based on investigations of early-diagnosed cases of COVID-19. The first cluster of cases — and the earliest sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes — were associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but study authors say the market cluster is unlikely to have marked the beginning of the pandemic because the earliest documented COVID-19 cases had no connection to the market.

Regional newspaper reports suggest COVID-19 diagnoses in Hubei date back to at least November 17, 2019, suggesting the virus was already actively circulating when Chinese authorities enacted public health measures.

In the new study, researchers used molecular clock evolutionary analyses to try to home in on when the first, or index, case of SARS-CoV-2 occurred. “Molecular clock” is a term for a technique that uses the mutation rate of genes to deduce when two or more life forms diverged — in this case, when the common ancestor of all variants of SARS-CoV-2 existed, estimated in this study to as early as mid-November 2019.

Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestor is often taken to be synonymous with the index case of an emerging disease. However, said co-author Michael Worobey, PhD, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at University of Arizona: “The index case can conceivably predate the common ancestor — the actual first case of this outbreak may have occurred days, weeks or even many months before the estimated common ancestor. Determining the length of that ‘phylogenetic fuse’ was at the heart of our investigation.”

Based on this work, the researchers estimate that the median number of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China was less than one until November 4, 2019. Thirteen days later, it was four individuals, and just nine on December 1, 2019. The first hospitalizations in Wuhan with a condition later identified as COVID-19 occurred in mid-December.

Study authors used a variety of analytical tools to model how the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have behaved during the initial outbreak and early days of the pandemic when it was largely an unknown entity and the scope of the public health threat not yet fully realized.

These tools included epidemic simulations based on the virus’s known biology, such as its transmissibility and other factors, developed by study co-author Niema Moshiri, PhD, assistant teaching professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. In just 29.7 percent of these simulations was the virus able to create self-sustaining epidemics. In the other 70.3 percent, the virus infected relatively few persons before dying out. The average failed epidemic ended just eight days after the index case.



“Typically, scientists use the viral genetic diversity to get the timing of when a virus started to spread,” said Wertheim. “Our study added a crucial layer on top of this approach by modeling how long the virus could have circulated before giving rise to the observed genetic diversity.

“Our approach yielded some surprising results. We saw that over two-thirds of the epidemics we attempted to simulate went extinct. That means that if we could go back in time and repeat 2019 one hundred times, two out of three times, COVID-19 would have fizzled out on its own without igniting a pandemic. This finding supports the notion that humans are constantly being bombarded with zoonotic pathogens.”

Wertheim noted that even as SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in China in the fall of 2019, the researchers’ model suggests it was doing so at low levels until at least December of that year.

“Given that, it’s hard to reconcile these low levels of virus in China with claims of infections in Europe and the U.S. at the same time,” Wertheim said. “I am quite skeptical of claims of COVID-19 outside China at that time.”

The original strain of SARS-CoV-2 became epidemic, the authors write, because it was widely dispersed, which favors persistence, and because it thrived in urban areas where transmission was easier. In simulated epidemics involving less dense rural communities, epidemics went extinct 94.5 to 99.6 percent of the time.

The virus has since mutated multiple times, with a number of variants becoming more transmissible.

“Pandemic surveillance wasn’t prepared for a virus like SARS-CoV-2,” Wertheim said. “We were looking for the next SARS or MERS, something that killed people at a high rate, but in hindsight, we see how a highly transmissible virus with a modest mortality rate can also lay the world low.”

Chinese company CanSino Biologics said in a filing on the Hong Kong stock exchange on March 23 that the inhalation vaccine candidate is jointly developed with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology.

CanSino said its application for human testing received the green light from the Chinese authorities on March 22. But the company warned that the vaccine's safety and efficacy are subject to confirmation in trials.

CanSino had developed an injection-based, single-dose Covid-19 vaccine that is being used in China. It has also been approved for use in Pakistan, Mexico and Hungary.

Its inhalation vaccine candidate is no different in terms of virus species, cell banks, production technology or preparation formula from the injection-based Covid-19 vaccine, said Chinese state-owned newspaper Global Times. However, it has an atomisation inhalation device.

This device enables the vaccine to be atomised into tiny particles and then inhaled into the respiratory tract and lungs to stimulate an immune response in the mucous membranes, a Beijing-based immunology expert, who declined to be named, told the Global Times.

One important goal of an inhaled vaccine is to prevent the pathogen from growing in the nose, a point from which it can spread to the rest of the body, and to other people.

Research by scientists at Imperial College London, published in the journal Science last October, showed that a strong mucosal immune response is vital for staving off respiratory infections.

Professor Jiang Chunlai from Jilin University's School of Life Sciences told the Global Times: ""We have seen intranasal vaccines against influenza in China. But there have been limited clinical studies on inhaled (Covid-19) vaccines.""

Prof Jiang said further clinical trials are needed to determine the dosage, and inhalation is also not suitable for all types of vaccines.

CanSino's inhalation vaccine candidate is not the first that uses an alternative delivery method.

Last November, an experimental dual vaccine for both influenza and Covid-19 delivered via a nasal spray entered the stage of human studies in Hong Kong.

The clinical trial was to enrol about 100 adults, said Professor Yuen Kwok Yung, chairman of infectious diseases at The University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology.

The candidate vaccine is similar to a nasal spray flu immunisation already on the market that is designed to start working where respiratory viruses typically enter the body - the nose.

The joint study by researchers from the University of Hong Kong, Xiamen University, and vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy started last October.

The clinical trial will seek to demonstrate the vaccine's safety as well as the optimal dosage."
