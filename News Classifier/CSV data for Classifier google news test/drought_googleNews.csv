“We hope companies can reduce water usage by 7% to 11%.”With limited rainfall forecast for the months ahead, Taiwan Water Corporation this week said the island has entered the “toughest moment”.
“We are making preparations for our future water demand,” TSMC told Reuters, describing the move as a “pressure test”.
Both Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation and United Microelectronics Corp signed contracts with water trucks and said there was no impact on production.","order, droughthit, worst, auto, week, semiconductor, united, chipmakers, supply, production, truckload, tsmc, taiwan, water, prepare, trucks"

According to the advisory, most of the central and southern districts of Balochistan are experiencing mild to moderate drought.
""Keeping in view the climatology and current seasonal forecast of PMD for these areas, drought conditions may exacerbate and affect agriculture and livestock.
Dry conditions will cause water stress in the cultivated lands/areas of the country due to limited supply of irrigation water for Rabi crops,"" the advisory said.

AdvertisementA strip of the far north coast also dropped out of moderate drought into abnormal dryness, according to monitor data.
Overall, 85.9% of the state remained in moderate, severe, extreme or exceptional drought, down from more than 95% in the week-earlier report.
The season’s second Sierra snowpack survey, which is used to forecast water supply, found Wednesday that the water content was 70% of average to date and 45% of the April 1 average, when the snowpack is usually deepest and has the highest water content.

The urgency of California’s drought and wildfire risks require that we invest in soil health now.

Worldwide, soil carbon sequestration could remove 110 parts per million of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 50 years, studies show.
Improving soil health can improve the resilience of rural farming communities, many of which dwell at the margins of economic viability.","worsening, health, healthy, counter, climate, sequestration, improve, atmosphere, california, drought, soils, soil, carbon, water, needs"

Jamaica, which foreigners have long associated with pot, reggae and Rastafarians, authorised a regulated medical marijuana industry and decriminalised small amounts of weed in 2015.
Heavy rains followed by an extended drought, an increase in local consumption and a drop in the number of marijuana farmers have caused a shortage in the island's famed but largely illegal market that experts say is the worst they have seen.
