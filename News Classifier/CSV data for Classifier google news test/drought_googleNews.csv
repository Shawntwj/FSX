Toward the late 21st century, the global population and land area experiencing severe droughts are estimated to increase by more than two-fold— increasing from 3% between 1976 and 2005 to 7%–8%, stated Yadu Pokhrel, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in MSU’s College of Engineering. The study was published in the Nature Climate Change journal.

More and more people will suffer from extreme droughts if a medium-to-high level of global warming continues and water management is maintained at its present state. Areas of the Southern Hemisphere, where water scarcity is already a problem, will be disproportionately affected. We predict this increase in water scarcity will affect food security and escalate human migration and conflict. Yadu Pokhrel, Study Lead Author and Associate Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Michigan State University

The research group, which includes Farshid Felfelani, a postdoctoral researcher from MSU, and over 20 contributing authors from Japan, China, and Europe, is predicting a massive reduction in natural land water storage in as much as two-thirds of the world; this large reduction was also induced by climate change.

Land water storage, technically called terrestrial water storage, or TWS for short, is the build-up of water in rivers, ice and snow, lakes and reservoirs, soil, wetlands, and groundwater—all crucial components of water and energy supply in the world. TWS modulates the water flow inside the hydrological cycle and establishes the availability of water and also drought.

Our findings are a concern. To date, no study has examined how climate change would impact land water storage globally. Our study presents the first, comprehensive picture of how global warming and socioeconomic changes will affect land water storage and what that will mean for droughts until the end of the century. Yadu Pokhrel, Study Lead Author and Associate Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Michigan State University

According to Felfelani, the study has provided the international team with a significant prediction opportunity.

Felfelani added, “Recent advances in process-based hydrological modeling, combined with future projections from global climate models under wide-ranging scenarios of socioeconomic change, provided a unique foundation for comprehensive analysis of future water availability and droughts. We have high confidence in our results because we use dozens of models and they agree on the projected changes.”

The study is based on a set of 27 global climate-hydrological model simulations covering 125 years and was performed under a global modeling project, known as the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. Pokhrel is also a working member of the study.

Our findings highlight why we need climate change mitigation to avoid the adverse impacts on global water supplies and increased droughts we know about now. We need to commit to improved water resource management and adaptation to avoid potentially catastrophic socio-economic consequences of water shortages around the world.

In our study, we collected tree rings from an experimental pine forest that scientists planted in Scotland in 1935.
Years with a favourable climate generally produce wide tree rings, while bad years with droughts or other stressful weather produce narrow rings.
To understand how trees recover from drought, we compared the width of these rings formed in drought years with growth modelled in an average year and throughout their recovery.
But our study clearly demonstrates that this mechanism exists in Scots pine, and can help forests recover a lot of the woody biomass that drought robs them of.","trees, forests, recover, rings, overdrive, tree, growth, drought, climate, study, species",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"One in 12 people could face severe drought every year by 2100, according to a recent study. And water stored on two-thirds of the Earth’s land surface will shrink as the climate warms. As plant ecologists, we’re concerned with what that means for forests – one of the largest carbon sinks and biggest assets the world has in the fight against climate change.

Droughts can stunt forest growth, kill trees and even change how forests function, or what species they’re made up of. We studied one species in particular to understand how trees have responded to past droughts, and how resilient they’re likely to be.

What we found suggests that some trees could rebound from difficult periods with more vitality than we might have imagined, which could be good news for forests facing a drier future.

Tree ring records

Scots pine is one of the most widely distributed conifer species in the world. In its native range across Europe, it supports a broad range of wildlife such as red squirrels, and is widely grown for its timber.

In our study, we collected tree rings from an experimental pine forest that scientists planted in Scotland in 1935. Trees form these rings in their trunks and, in doing so, record how growth varied according to the climate conditions of each season. Years with a favourable climate generally produce wide tree rings, while bad years with droughts or other stressful weather produce narrow rings.

These rings effectively allow scientists to look back in time. To understand how trees recover from drought, we compared the width of these rings formed in drought years with growth modelled in an average year and throughout their recovery.

Playing catch-up

We found that even trees of the same age and species growing in the same place took very different lengths of time to recover from drought. On average, the rate of tree growth took four years to recover to levels that might have been expected if no drought had occurred, with most trees taking between one and six years – though some trees still hadn’t recovered this growth rate nine years later.

After digging a little deeper, we found that the size of each tree before the drought, or how fast it was growing at the time, made a significant difference to how resilient it was. Fast growing trees bounced back quicker, but larger trees took a longer time to achieve growth rates that would have been expected if no drought had happened.

What really surprised us was what happened in some trees after growth had recovered. Rather than continuing to grow at rates we might have expected from the temperature and rainfall records in those post-recovery years, the growth of some trees went into overdrive, and these trees actually started growing faster than in our modelled scenario where no drought had occurred.

While this growth “overdrive” was only temporary and didn’t occur in all of the trees we studied, the combined effect of this compensatory growth was powerful. These trees grew so fast that they started to recover some of the trunk girth that had been lost from the forest as a result of the drought. This meant that the total impact of the drought after nine years was much less than after four years, which is normally the post-drought period similar studies consider.

Compensatory growth happens elsewhere in nature – it’s been recorded in species of fish, grasses and moths. One study found that female greater wax moths deprived of food for 12 hours undergo rapid growth to catch up once food returns, though the cost of this behaviour is a shorter lifespan.

If or how mature trees use compensatory growth to deal with drought is largely unexplored, perhaps because, until now, studies have only captured their short-term response. But our study clearly demonstrates that this mechanism exists in Scots pine, and can help forests recover a lot of the woody biomass that drought robs them of.

Now we need to see how common this phenomenon is in other species and in other parts of the world. Even if this habit is widespread, the ability of trees to compensate for growth lost during a drought will depend on the climate remaining good for growth long after the drought has ended. Similarly, more frequent and severe droughts could quickly overwhelm any benefits.

Nevertheless, our results do suggest that we may be underestimating how resilient some forests are and overestimating how much future droughts will cost trees. This could have implications for climate change, so scientists will now need to find out more about this mechanism to strengthen their models. And since we found that trees respond differently to drought, having a variety of sizes and growth rates could leave forests in better stead to respond to the challenges the future will bring."

Success from solution group

Looking back over the past year, we cannot help but be surprised when the agricultural sector successfully overcame the most saltwater intrusion and drought event in history in the Mekong Delta with a group of solutions. This result was seriously evaluated at the conference on implementing the saltwater intrusion and drought prevention and control in the 2020-2021 dry season taking place on 23 September, 2020 in Tien Giang under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.

At this conference, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Xuan Cuong shared: saltwater intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta in 2019-2020 is the most severe disaster event in history, but the level of damage has decreased significantly. We have gathered valuable lessons for the coming time. Specifically, we had identified challenges of this season from very early time.

Therefore, right from September 2019, the Prime Minister had held a conference to the leaders of the Mekong Delta provinces to discuss groups of solutions to reduce the damage when disaster occurs.

What is that group of solutions? First of all, the prediction of saltwater intrusion and drought period is well and early assessed, localities in the Mekong Delta region arrange a seasonal calendar and production structure suitable to the state of water resources in each sub-region, along with close directions and administration from the Government, ministries, authorities.

Also at that important meeting, MARD Minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong posed the fundamental problem in the coming time. That is, it is necessary to find out the most suitable crops, animals and production methods to not only limit negative impacts but also exploit advantages.

""Changing the production axis, restructuring agricultural production towards sustainability and adaptation is the ultimate goal towards"", the Minister said.

Not subjective, but more confident

In the last days of 2020, in the fields, farmers in the Mekong Delta are busy sowing and taking care of the 2020-2021 winter-spring crop. Accompanying farmers and Mekong Delta provinces, since the beginning of this rice crop, there have been many field trips from the Department of Crop Production, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Most recently, on December 17, 2020, the survey team led by Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Quoc Doanh arrived in Can Tho City, Hau Giang, Soc Trang and Tra Vinh. Together with the mission, there are many specialized agencies and media.

Deputy Minister Le Quoc Doanh, after going live inspection on the field, met with farmers exuded optimism and confidence. He highly appreciated the preparation of production plans and seasonal calendars that the agricultural sectors of the Mekong Delta provinces applying to farmers in accordance with the guiding of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

He said that the rice fields in the Mekong Delta provinces are developing very well, especially in the coastal provinces with a high risk of saltwater intrusion. From last year's experience, farmers have been recommended by specialized branches to proactively sow seeds early. Up to this moment, drought and saltwater intrusion can be confidently avoided.

However, the danger of saltwater intrusion and drought is still likely to occur, it is suggested that localities and people must not be subjective. In order for the 2020 - 2021 winter-spring crop to be completely successful, he suggested that local people focus on sowing the entire remaining rice area in December 2020. Concentrate on using water in the most economical and reasonable way. At the same time, prepare facilities to deal with possible saltwater intrusion and drought, especially from mid to late winter-spring.

Mr. Le Thanh Tung, Deputy Director of the Department of Crop Production, said: By the end of December 2020, the Mekong Delta will sow seeds to more than 1.45/1.55 million hectares as planned, the remaining 100 thousand hectares pass to about 10 January 2021. Currently, the rice price is soaring, so the area could increase by several tens of thousands of hectares.

Through the survey, most of the rice areas located in the areas prone to drought and saltwater intrusion have passed the maximum growth period last year.

Expected to harvest about 200,000 hectares before the Lunar New Year, this area is mostly located in the area prone to drought and saltwater intrusion. Including the Go Cong freshening zone and some coastal areas of Tra Vinh, Soc Trang, Kien Giang, and part of Hau Giang.

Better understanding and adaption

The watercourse in the Mekong Delta depends almost entirely on the flow from the upper Mekong. Therefore, water resources of the Mekong River play a crucial role in influencing saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta.

According to the natural law in the Mekong Delta, it is possible to observe the flooding season of the previous year to foresee the drought situation right after the Lunar New Year. This year's dry season, experts also forecast that saltwater intrusion and drought will continue to be fierce.

On a macro perspective, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc also posed this issue at a conference to discuss saltwater intrusion and drought on September 23, 2020 in Tien Giang.

“We need to realize that drought, saltwater intrusion is an unavoidable problem, can only be limited and should be a normal story in the life of the Mekong Delta from now on. They are a risk, but at the same time, there are opportunities if we can respond and adapt. There must be a master plan for the Mekong Delta to have a longer-term vision, not be hot, deal each year, ”said the Prime Minister.

Live naturally, depend on natural laws to actively adapt. That knowledge was also recorded into the viewpoints, objectives, orientations and solutions in the Government's Resolution 120/NQ-CP on the development of the Mekong Delta to adapt to climate change.

In this context, the Resolution 120 of the Government is a long-term strategic solution for the Mekong Delta. The central key to the problem is to transform the Mekong Delta agriculture in the spirit of Government's Resolution No. 120 from production quantity to quality.

Resolution 120 defines the strategic pivot to prioritize fisheries and crops. It also specifies that saltwater, brackish water, and fresh water are all natural resources, not just fresh water as before. Understanding and adapting to the laws of nature, we save effort but also take advantage of the opportunities.

""We recall that 2016 was a year of severe drought, and many fields were dry and burned, leading to great damage.

In 2020, there will also be a severe drought, but the damage has decreased significantly. Last year also in Tien Giang, the Prime Minister also chaired a conference on prevention of saltwater intrusion. Thus, there have been many conferences recently, actively directing drastically, so the damage has decreased significantly. Many provinces have handled the problem of drinking water well for the people.

The year 2019-2020 seasion is a good season, the loss due to disaster is only 7-8%. If we take the initiative from the beginning of the year, the damage will be greatly reduced, ""Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at the conference on prevention of saltwater intrusion and drought on September 23, 2020 in Tien Giang.

Rapid Climate Change and Late Medieval Europe in a Global Perspectivehttps://dantean.hypotheses.org/DFG Transregio ""Arctic Climate Change (AC)³""http://www.ac3-tr.de/","century, weather, research, patterns, ages, middle, today, change, precipitation, historical, parallels, drought, europe, climate, study, droughts",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"Leipzig. The transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age was apparently accompanied by severe droughts between 1302 and 1307 in Europe; this preceded the wet and cold phase of the 1310s and the resulting great famine of 1315-21. In the journal Climate of the Past, researchers from the Leibniz Institutes for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO) and Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) write that the 1302-07 weather patterns display similarities to the 2018 weather anomaly, in which continental Europe experienced exceptional heat and drought. Both the medieval and recent weather patterns resemble the stable weather patterns that have occurred more frequently since the 1980s due to the increased warming of the Arctic. According to the Leibniz researchers' hypothesis based on their comparison of the 1302-07 and 2018 droughts, transitional phases in the climate are always characterized by periods of low variability, in which weather patterns remain stable for a long time. The published study presents preliminary findings of the Freigeist Junior Research Group on the Dantean Anomaly (1309-1321) at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO). Funded by the Volkswagen Stiftung, the group is investigating the rapid climate change in the early 14th century and its effects on late medieval Europe.

The Great Famine (1315-1321) is considered the largest pan-European famine of the past millennium. It was followed a few years later by the Black Death (1346-1353), the most devastating pandemic known, which wiped out about a third of the population. At least partially responsible for both of these crises was a phase of rapid climate change after 1310, called the ""Dantean Anomaly"" after the contemporary Italian poet and philosopher Dante Alighieri. The 1310s represent a transitional phase from the High Medieval Climate Anomaly, a period of relatively high temperatures, to the Little Ice Age, a long climatic period characterized by lower temperatures and advancing glaciers.

The Leipzig-based researchers are studying the regions of northern Italy, southeastern France, and east central Europe. These areas have been little studied with regard to the Great Famine thus far, but offer a variety of historical sources for the reconstruction of extreme meteorological events and their socio-economic effects, including how vulnerable societies were at the time. ""We want to show that historical climate change can be reconstructed much better if written historical sources are incorporated alongside climate archives like tree rings or sediment cores. The inclusion of humanities research clearly contributes to a better understanding of the social consequences of climate change in the past and to drawing conclusions for the future,"" explains Dr Martin Bauch from the GWZO, who heads the junior research group.

The study now published evaluates a large number of historical sources: chronicles from present-day France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Regional and municipal chronicles provided information on historical city fires, which were an important indicator of droughts. Administrative records from Siena (Italy), the County of Savoy (France) and the associated region of Bresse shed light on economic developments there. Using the data, it was possible, for example, to estimate wheat and wine production in the French region of Bresse and compare it with wheat production in England. Since these yields depend strongly on climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation, it is thus possible to draw conclusions about the climate in the respective production years.

While the summer of 1302 was still very rainy in central Europe, several hot, very dry summers followed from 1304 onwards. From the perspective of climate history, this was the most severe drought of the 13th and 14th centuries. ""Sources from the Middle East also report severe droughts. Water levels in the Nile, for example, were exceptionally low. We therefore think that the 1304-06 drought was not only a regional phenomenon, but probably had transcontinental dimensions,"" reports Dr. Thomas Labbé from the GWZO.

Based on the recorded effects, the team reconstructed the historical weather conditions between the summer of 1302 and 1307. Through evaluations of the 2018 drought and similar extreme events, it is now known that, in such cases, a so-called ""precipitation seesaw"" usually prevails. This is the meteorological term for a sharp contrast between extremely high precipitation in one part of Europe and extremely low precipitation in another. ""This is usually caused by stable high and low pressure areas that remain in one region for an unusually long time. In 2018, for example, very stable lows lay over the North Atlantic and southern Europe for a long time, which led to heavy precipitation there and an extreme drought in between in central Europe,"" explains meteorologist Dr Patric Seifert from TROPOS, who was responsible for reconstructing the large-scale weather situations for the study. The analysis of the possible large-scale weather situations indicates that between 1303 and 1307, a strong, stable high pressure system predominated over central Europe, which explains the extreme drought in these years.

The analysis of these historical weather situations is particularly interesting given the ongoing discussion about how climate change in the Arctic affects weather patterns in Europe. In recent decades, the Arctic has warmed more than twice as much as other regions of the world. This phenomenon, called ""Arctic Amplification,"" is being studied by a DFG Collaborative Research Centre led by the University of Leipzig. One theory assumes that the disproportionate warming of the Arctic causes the temperature differences--and thus also the atmospheric dynamics--between the mid-latitudes and the region around the North Pole to decrease. As a result, according to a common hypothesis, weather patterns may persist longer than in the past. ""Even if it was a phase of cooling in the Middle Ages and we are now living in a phase of man-made warming, there could be parallels. The transitional period between two climate phases could be characterized by smaller temperature differences between the latitudes and cause longer-lasting large-scale weather patterns, which could explain an increase in extreme events,"" Seifert cautions.

In their study, the researchers recorded a noticeable coincidence between the periods of drought and urban fires. Fires were a great danger for the densely constructed cities in the Middle Ages, where there were no fire brigades like there are today. The best documented fire between 1302 and 1307 was probably in Florence, where over 1,700 houses burned on 10 June 1304. Sources for Italy and France showed a correlation between extreme drought and fires. ""We think our analysis is the first to find a correlation between fires and droughts over a two-hundred-year period. Large urban fires usually followed droughts by a year. The wooden structures in medieval houses did not dry out immediately. But once they did, they ignited very easily,"" explains Bauch. Contemporaries were also aware of the connection between drought and fire: during dry periods, citizens were obliged to place buckets of water next to their front doors--a primitive sort of fire extinguisher, to be kept available at all times. It was only later that municipalities organized fire brigades, for example in Florence around 1348. Major infrastructural measures in response to the droughts have survived in the cities of northern Italy: Parma and Siena invested in larger, deeper wells, and Siena also bought a harbor on the Mediterranean coast, which it expanded after the drought years of 1302-04 in order to be able to import grain and become less dependent on domestic production.

""According to our analysis, the drought of 1302-1307 was a once-in-a-century event with regard to its duration. No other drought reached these dimensions in the 13th and 14th centuries. The next event that came close was not until the drought of 1360-62, which stretched across Europe and for which there indications in the historical record in Japan, Korea, and India,"" concludes Annabell Engel, M.A., from GWZO. In connection with global warming, researchers expect more frequent extreme events such as droughts. While numerous studies have already documented strong fluctuations in the 1340s, shortly before the plague epidemic, the first decade of the 14th century, unlike the 1310s, has been the focus of little research so far. The Leibniz researchers have now been able to show for the first time that exceptionally dry summers between 1302 and 1304 to the south of the Alps and 1304 and 1307 north of the Alps were the result of stable weather conditions and disparately distributed precipitation. The study thus sheds new light on the first years of the 14th century with its dramatic changes and draws a link to modern climate changes. ""However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about future climatic developments in the 21st century from our study. While climate fluctuations in the 14th century were natural phenomena, in the modern age, humans are exerting artificial influence on the climate, as well,"" note Bauch and Seifert.

Everything from hydroelectric power generation to agricultural production to the bubbling fountains at Las Vegas casinos could be impacted.

Impacts on hydro generation could have ripple effects across the Southwest, including solar and energy storage.

A forecast released in mid-January by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said that the federally owned Lake Mead and Lake Powell — the nation’s two largest reservoirs and critical storage for Colorado River water and its 40 million users — are both approaching near-record-low levels. If those levels continue dropping as expected, agreements signed by the seven Colorado River Basin states in 2019 will go into effect, with water deliveries curtailed to keep the federal government from stepping in and imposing cuts of its own.

The Upper Colorado River basin region includes all or parts of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Drought has been an ongoing problem across much of the region for most of the century. The Bureau of Reclamation’s latest quarterly report showed Lake Powell at 42% of capacity and Lake Mead at 40%.

Three hydro plants that could be affected as water levels fall are the 1,312 MW station built at Glen Canyon Dam in 1964, and two hydro plants at Hoover Dam, which were built in 1936 and have a combined capacity of 2,078 MW.

In 2019, the Glen Canyon station generated nearly 4 million MWh of electricity. Combined, the two Hoover Dam stations generated roughly 3.4 million MWh, according to S&P Global.

The Bureau of Reclamation said in its report that during the 21-year period from 2000 to 2020, inflow to Lake Powell, which is a good measure of hydrologic conditions in the Colorado River Basin, was above average in only four of the past 19 years. It said the period 2000-2020 was the lowest 21-year period since the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963.

The report said that under the current most probable forecast, the total water-year 2021 inflow to Lake Powell would be 5.72 million acre-feet, or roughly 53% of average.

If worst-case projections materialize, the water level at Lake Powell could drop below a critical level — measured as 3,525 feet above sea level — in early 2022, threatening the ability of Glen Canyon Dam to generate electricity."

Land water storage, technically known as terrestrial water storage, or TWS, is the accumulation of water in snow and ice, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, wetlands, soil and groundwater — all critical components of the world’s water and energy supply.
“To date, no study has examined how climate change would impact land water storage globally.
“Our findings highlight why we need climate change mitigation to avoid the adverse impacts on global water supplies and increased droughts we know about now,” Pokhrel said.","research, global, number, change, extreme, suffering, water, storage, land, double, climate, pokhrel, study, droughts",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"Michigan State University is leading a global research effort to offer the first worldwide view of how climate change could affect water availability and drought severity in the decades to come.

By the late 21st century, global land area and population facing extreme droughts could more than double — increasing from 3% during 1976-2005 to 7%-8%, according to Yadu Pokhrel, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering in MSU’s College of Engineering, and lead author of the research published in Nature Climate Change.

“More and more people will suffer from extreme droughts if a medium-to-high level of global warming continues and water management is maintained at its present state,” Pokhrel said. “Areas of the Southern Hemisphere, where water scarcity is already a problem, will be disproportionately affected. We predict this increase in water scarcity will affect food security and escalate human migration and conflict.”

The research team, including MSU postdoctoral researcher Farshid Felfelani, and more than 20 contributing authors from Europe, China and Japan are projecting a large reduction in natural land water storage in two-thirds of the world, also caused by climate change.

Land water storage, technically known as terrestrial water storage, or TWS, is the accumulation of water in snow and ice, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, wetlands, soil and groundwater — all critical components of the world’s water and energy supply. TWS modulates the flow of water within the hydrological cycle and determines water availability as well as drought.

“Our findings are a concern,” Pokhrel said. “To date, no study has examined how climate change would impact land water storage globally. Our study presents the first, comprehensive picture of how global warming and socioeconomic changes will affect land water storage and what that will mean for droughts until the end of the century.”

Felfelani said the study has given the international team an important prediction opportunity.

“Recent advances in process-based hydrological modeling, combined with future projections from global climate models under wide-ranging scenarios of socioeconomic change, provided a unique foundation for comprehensive analysis of future water availability and droughts,” Felfelani said. “We have high confidence in our results because we use dozens of models and they agree on the projected changes.”

The research is based on a set of 27 global climate-hydrological model simulations spanning 125 years and was conducted under a global modeling project called the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. Pokhrel is a working member of the project.

“Our findings highlight why we need climate change mitigation to avoid the adverse impacts on global water supplies and increased droughts we know about now,” Pokhrel said. “We need to commit to improved water resource management and adaptation to avoid potentially catastrophic socio-economic consequences of water shortages around the world.”

[Lingering La Niñas may help forecasters spot costly weather patterns two years away]

The forecast persistence of La Niña, a periodic cooling of the waters in the eastern tropical Pacific along the equator, through the winter favors a worsening of drought conditions along the southern tier of the U.S.

In Southern California, the wildfire season finally came to an end in late December, but rains have been sporadic and light into the start of the new year. The state’s first snow survey of the year shows that the statewide snowpack was just 52 percent of average on Jan. 1. Storms are likely to increase that percentage during the next few weeks, but the dry fall has put the Golden State at a deficit that could be difficult to make up given the favored storm track.

Unlike El Niño years, which feature above average water temperatures in the tropical Pacific and can direct a relentless firehose of moisture at the West throughout the winter, La Niña winters tend to favor stormy conditions in the Pacific Northwest instead.

A total of 49 percent of the Lower 48 states were in moderate to exceptional drought conditions as of Dec. 29, with dry conditions extending north into Alberta.

While droughts come and go, there is increasing evidence that parts of the U.S., namely the Southwest, are enduring long-term “megadrought” conditions seen in historical tree ring records. This is partly related to climate change, which worsens droughts by increasing temperatures, thereby turbocharging the loss of moisture from plants and soils. Climate change is also shifting weather patterns in ways that favor drier conditions in the Southwest U.S., pushing storm tracks northward.

The above chart shows the percent of total land area in the Lower 48 states that are in drought conditions. You’ll see the huge spike between 2010 and 2015, which coincided with a costly drought in Texas and California’s most intense and long-lasting drought more in than a millennium, and the recent climb that has not yet leveled off.

The seasonal precipitation forecast from the Climate Prediction Center at NOAA shows the likelihood of a La Niña-tinged winter weather pattern, with a drier than average southern tier. This would be especially bad news for states like California, New Mexico and Arizona, but also southern Texas and Florida, too.

But, the researchers say, there has so far been no study of the potential impact of global climate change on global terrestrial water storage overall.
And they found that, while 3 per cent of the planet’s people were vulnerable to extreme drought in the timespan from 1976 to 2005, later in the century this proportion could increase to 7 per cent or even 8 per cent.
Drought stress risesThe footprint of extreme drought and fire is massive.","global, researchers, human, water, change, extreme, 2060, climate, drought, double, risk, north, study",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"As climate change threatens a doubling of the impact of extreme drought and fire within a generation, researchers are uncovering the influence of human activity on both these growing risks.

One study has found that human numbers exposed to the hazard of extreme drought are likely to double in the decades to come, as global heating bakes away the groundwater and limits annual snowfall.

Another team of researchers says the risks of extreme wildfire could also rise twofold in the next 40 years in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, eastern North America and the Amazon. In those places already severely scorched by frequent fire − western North America, equatorial Africa, south-east Asia and Australia − hazards could rise by 50 per cent.

And a third, separate study warns that global temperature rise will shift the patterns of rainfall around the tropics − with the consequent risks to tropical crop harvests and to equatorial ecosystems such as rainforest and savannah.

All three studies are reminders of the intricacies of the planetary climate system and the impact of human action in the last hundred years.

An international research team reports in the journal Nature Climate Change that it looked at the simple problem of global terrestrial water storage: all the moisture in the canopies of forest trees, in the mountain snows and ice, in the lakes, rivers, wetlands, and in the soil itself.

This wealth of stored water is a big player in the patterns of global flooding and drought in the monsoon climates and the arid lands alike. But, the researchers say, there has so far been no study of the potential impact of global climate change on global terrestrial water storage overall.

So researchers from the US, China, Japan and Europe began modelling tomorrow’s world. And they found that, while 3 per cent of the planet’s people were vulnerable to extreme drought in the timespan from 1976 to 2005, later in the century this proportion could increase to 7 per cent or even 8 per cent.

“More and more people will suffer from extreme droughts if a medium-to-high level of global warming continues and water management is maintained in its present state,” warned Yadu Pokhrel, an engineer at Michigan State University, who led the research.

“Areas of the southern hemisphere, where water scarcity is already a problem, will be disproportionately affected. We predict this increase in water scarcity will affect food security and escalate human migration and conflict.”

Fire chances increased

Australia is a southern hemisphere country that knows about water scarcity: its wildfires in 2019 broke all records and sent a vast cloud of smoke to an altitude of 35 kms.

And, on the evidence of a new study in the journal Nature Communications, it won’t be the last such extreme event. Californian scientists, struck by the scale and intensity of Californian wildfires in 2017 and 2018, report that they took a closer look at the way greenhouse gas emissions and human land use change have played into the risks of extreme fire weather.

The simple act of setting forests afire to clear land for farm use has amplified the risk of extreme blazes in the Amazon and North America by 30 per cent in the last century. Fires create aerosols that could, by absorbing sunlight, help cool the terrain beneath them − in some zones. But they could also affect rainfall levels and raise the chances of fire. The nature of such impacts varies from place to place.

“South-east Asia relies on the monsoon, but aerosols cause so much cooling on land that they can actually suppress a monsoon,” said Danielle Touma of the University of California at Santa Barbara. “It’s not just whether you have aerosols or not, it’s the way the regional climate interacts with aerosols.”

Aerosols − with other forces − cannot just suppress a monsoon, they can shift rain patterns permanently. The tropics, too, have begun to feel the heat of the moment.

Drought stress rises

The footprint of extreme drought and fire is massive. Californian researchers report in Nature Climate Change that, across two thirds of the globe, the tropical rainbelt is likely to shift north over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean to cause more drought stress in south-eastern Africa and Madagascar and intensified flooding in south Asia.

In the western hemisphere, however, as the Gulf Stream current and the North Atlantic deep water formation weaken, the rain belt could move south to bring greater drought stress to Central America.

And once again, climate change driven by global heating is at work with other human influences to alter what had for most of human history been a stable pattern of climate.

“In Asia, projected reductions in aerosol emissions, glacier melting in the Himalayas and loss of snow cover in northern areas brought on by climate change will cause the atmosphere to heat up faster than in other regions,” said James Randerson of the University of California, Irvine, one of the authors.

“We know the rainbelt shifts towards this heating, and that its northward movement in the eastern hemisphere is consistent with these expected impacts of climate change.”

There was a time in the 1990s when Cowboys fans could legitimately think of a championship parade in downtown Dallas without a smirk. The Cowboys had Super Bowl-winning seasons in 1992 and 1993, went to the NFC Championship Game in 1994, and won their third Super Bowl in four years in the 1995 season.

Since then, a generation of fans has gone through the longest title drought in franchise history, clinging only to the stories told to them by their parents or grandparents about the Cowboys' ultimate success.

Coming off a 6-10 finish in 2020, it does not appear the drought will end in the 26th season, but there will always be hope -- sold by either the moves the Cowboys make this offseason or the never-ending positivity of owner and general manager Jerry Jones.

Of course, the drought did not have to be this long for a variety of reasons under Jones' stewardship. It's not like the Cowboys have lacked chances to reach the NFL's championship game.

Dallas has made the playoffs 10 times since winning Super Bowl XXX -- 1996, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2014, 2016 and 2018 -- but has not advanced past the divisional round.

As we ponder when the Cowboys will get back to the NFL's biggest stage, let's look at the best chances that eluded them.

In 2007 and 2016, the Cowboys had home-field advantage in the NFC, only to lose at Texas Stadium to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants (2007) and at AT&T Stadium to Mike McCarthy's Green Bay Packers (2016) after a miraculous third-and-21 completion in the final seconds.

But were those the best Cowboys teams to miss getting to the Super Bowl? Here are ones you might recall:

2014 Cowboys (12-4) under coach Jason Garrett

Why it should have happened: The Cowboys closed the regular season with four straight wins, scoring at least 38 points in each of the victories. They needed some good fortune in the wild-card win against the Detroit Lions -- a non-pass interference call and a fourth-down conversion from quarterback Tony Romo to tight end Jason Witten -- but this was a team that found a way to win games with big plays, even with a defense that did not have a Pro Bowler.

Why it didn't happen: NFL officials Gene Steratore and Dean Blandino. Dez Bryant's fourth-down catch at the Packers' 1-yard line was overturned by replay late in the fourth quarter. Bryant took three steps and lunged for the goal line after making the catch -- and it was a catch. But the ref, Steratore, and the NFL's director of officiating, Blandino, ruled Bryant did not maintain possession as he went to the ground. The Packers took over and ran the clock out with two third-down conversions. Ultimately, the play led the NFL to rewrite its rules, but that did not heal any ill feelings. If the catch had been upheld and the Cowboys scored the go-ahead touchdown, who knows if the Dallas defense could have stopped Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the final four minutes. But this was a defense that did make some key stops throughout the season.

Biggest what-if: The turning point of the Cowboys' season came in Week 6 with a 30-23 win against the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. Had the Cowboys beaten Green Bay, they would have returned to Seattle for the chance to go to Super Bowl XLIX. Comforted by the knowledge they already won there, the Cowboys would have carried a ton of confidence into the conference championship game.

2007 Cowboys (13-3) under coach Wade Phillips

Why it should have happened: This was the most talented Dallas team since the Super Bowl days. The Cowboys had 13 Pro Bowlers. They had Romo in his first full season as a starter. They had an offense that could win through the air (Witten, receivers Terrell Owens and Patrick Crayton) or on the ground (running backs Julius Jones and Marion Barber) with an offensive line that featured three Pro Bowlers (Flozell Adams, Leonard Davis and Andre Gurode). They also had a defense that could more than hold its own with DeMarcus Ware, Greg Ellis and Jay Ratliff anchoring the front seven, and defensive backs Roy Williams and Terence Newman.

Why it didn't happen: The Cowboys' season ended Jan. 13, 2008, with a 21-17 loss to the Giants, a team Dallas had beaten twice in the regular season. In looking back, it actually ended late in the regular season when they lost two of their last three games -- and their mojo. Phillips made great moves in his first season as Cowboys coach, but he let off the gas late in the season and the team could not regain its footing.

Biggest what-if: The Cowboys would have hosted the Packers at Texas Stadium in the NFC Championship Game had they beaten the Giants. The Cowboys essentially clinched home-field advantage with a 37-27 win in Week 13 against the Packers, their second-year coach Mike McCarthy and veteran quarterback Brett Favre. From 1993 to 1995, the Cowboys had playoff wins against the Packers, including the 1995 conference title game. History would have been on the Cowboys' side.

2016 Cowboys (13-3) under Garrett

Why it should have happened: Carried by the youth of quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys did not enter the playoffs with the scars of 2006, 2007 or 2014. Like the 2014 Cowboys, they were carried by the league's leading rusher, Elliott, and the NFL's best offensive line, which helped protect a defense that had one Pro Bowler (linebacker Sean Lee) and the NFL's top-ranked run defense. This team became hardened with wins at Pittsburgh and Green Bay and seemed headed for a run of successful seasons.

Why it didn't happen: Aaron Bleepin' Rodgers. Prescott overcame a shaky start to lead a furious comeback that allowed the Cowboys to tie the divisional-round home game with 35 seconds to play. Overtime looked to be assured, and even more so when Jeff Heath sacked Rodgers for a 10-yard loss. But on third-and-21, Rodgers spun to his left and fired a dart to tight end Jared Cook at the sideline for a 35-yard gain to the Dallas 33 with 3 seconds left. Mason Crosby hit a 51-yard field goal, his second from more than 50 yards in the final 1:33, giving the Packers the three-point win.

Biggest what-if: Prior to this loss, the Cowboys had been perfect in the postseason (2-0) at AT&T Stadium. The atmosphere inside the stadium for the playoff games had been far different from the somewhat docile atmosphere at most regular-season games. The Atlanta Falcons would have come to Arlington, Texas, for the NFC Championship Game. The Cowboys went 7-1 at home in the regular season with an average margin of victory of 10.8 points.

2006 Cowboys (9-7) under coach Bill Parcells

Why it should have happened: The Cowboys' season was saved when Romo became the starting quarterback in Week 7. They won five of his first six starts to get into the playoffs. The Cowboys closed with three losses in four games, which took away momentum, but with Parcells' two Super Bowls and an experienced staff, the Cowboys appeared ready to make a move in the postseason in a conference that did not have a dominant team.

Why it didn't happen: It might be the most gut-wrenching loss in team history. The Cowboys were poised to take the lead in the wild-card game at Seattle, moving down to the Seahawks' 1-yard line after what was ruled a first-down catch by Witten. A replay review moved the ball back to the 2, setting up a chip-shot field goal by Martin Gramatica with 1:19 left in the game. Unfortunately, he never got the chance to attempt the kick when the ball slipped through Romo's hands. The quarterback looked like he could score a touchdown as he scrambled, but he was stopped short of the end zone or a first down by Jordan Babineaux. Sitting on the field, Romo clutched his face mask in disbelief, and his voice quivered as he spoke following the 21-20 loss.

Biggest what-if: Many inside the organization at the time believe the Cowboys would have gone on to the divisional round and beaten the Chicago Bears, quarterbacked by Rex Grossman, and set up a potential championship game against Parcells' pupil, Sean Payton, and the New Orleans Saints. The Saints beat the Cowboys in Week 14, but maybe Parcells could have returned the favor in the playoffs. Instead, Parcells never coached another game in the NFL.

Bonus what-if: Would Parcells have walked away from such a talented, young team had the Cowboys beaten Seattle or not lost in such a painful way?"

The final U.S. Drought Monitor report of 2020 released last week shows how U.S. drought conditions now compare to those from a year ago. This is depicted in the map below, which shows the change in drought conditions by class, or category, across the U.S. in the one-year period ending Dec. 29, 2020.

An increase in the severity of the drought by two to five categories over a large area of the Southwest over the last year is most noticeable.

Areas that saw drought intensify by five categories weren't even in a drought this time a year ago, including parts of southwest Texas, southern New Mexico, Arizona, eastern Nevada and small parts of Utah and Colorado. Now they are in exceptional drought, the worst drought category.

You can see this drought intensification even clearer in the animation below. It shows how drought changed in the Southwest from the end of March to late December in 2020.

The Southwest emerged from early spring with some areas of moderate and severe drought. Now the region is covered by widespread extreme and exceptional drought, the two worst categories.

Drought comparison late March to late December in 2020. (NOAA/NDMC)

Advertisement One of the main reasons this happened is that showers and thunderstorms fueled by moisture from the summertime monsoon barely made an appearance in 2020. That's important since most of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. receive over half of their annual precipitation from the monsoon.

Late fall through winter and early spring is the Southwest's other wet season, but it's had a slow start as well.

Parts of Southern California and the Four Corners region picked up some modest rain and mountain snow relief early last week, but overall, the storm track has been shunted north of these areas so far this season.

Through November, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah are all on pace to have a top-five driest year in 2020, according to NOAA. Final rankings for the year as a whole will arrive on Thursday.

No Significant Near-Term Relief

We are in the midst of the wintertime wet season in the Southwest, but the weather pattern into mid-January won't cooperate by bringing heavy rain and mountain snow.

The storm track, or jet stream, will likely remain pointed at parts of the Northwest and western Canada through at least mid-month. That means the odds are tilted toward drier than average conditions persisting during this time in the southwestern quarter of the nation, according to the 8- to 14-day outlook (Jan. 12-18) from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.

A deep, southward plunge of the jet stream located near or just off the California coast would be more favorable for drawing moisture and storminess into the region. Until that happens, this drought in the Southwest will only intensify.

“It’s really about giving people an advanced warning,” said Eric Kuhn, former general manager of the Colorado River District, and one of the architects of the 2019 plan.
Under that agreement, some users in Nevada, Arizona and Mexico have had their Colorado River water deliveries curtailed due to sustained dry conditions.
As exceptional drought conditions expanded to more than 65% of the watershed’s total land area in 2020, operational forecasts for the Colorado River have worsened dramatically.
“That was the first glimmer we could be looking at this way earlier than we expected,” said Amy Haas, executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission.","elevation, upper, river, reservoirs, powell, water, plan, lake, triggered, colorado, forecast, mexico, drought",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"Increasingly bleak forecasts for the Colorado River have for the first time put into action elements of the 2019 upper basin drought contingency plan.

The 24-month study released in January by the Bureau of Reclamation, which projects two years of operations at the river’s biggest reservoirs, showed Lake Powell possibly dipping below an elevation of 3,525 feet above sea level in 2022. That elevation was designated as a critical threshold in the agreement to preserve the ability to produce hydropower at Glen Canyon Dam.

In a letter to water officials in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, the Bureau of Reclamation’s Wayne Pullan and Jacklynn Gould said the “minimum probable” forecast triggers “enhanced monitoring and coordination,” and instructed states to identify point persons to take part in monthly planning calls. Those meetings have yet to be scheduled.

“It’s really about giving people an advanced warning,” said Eric Kuhn, former general manager of the Colorado River District, and one of the architects of the 2019 plan.

The forecast in question is called the “minimum probable” forecast, one of the more pessimistic possible futures on the river that supplies water to 40 million people across seven U.S. states and two in Mexico. But the model makes clear it’s plausible that Lake Powell could see rapid declines within the next two years, Kuhn said, and water managers need to consider all possible scenarios and plan for them.

“We need a cushion, and time to react,” Kuhn said. “So the 3,525 (elevation) was put in as a way to give everyone time to think about what’s happening.”

If federal models show the reservoir’s elevation declining past that threshold under the “most probable” forecast, smaller reservoirs upstream in the four Upper Basin states could release water to prop up Lake Powell. The models don’t show that scenario as the likeliest to occur yet.

A parallel agreement in the river’s lower basin, which ties important water cutbacks to the level of Lake Mead outside Las Vegas, was implemented the year it was signed. Under that agreement, some users in Nevada, Arizona and Mexico have had their Colorado River water deliveries curtailed due to sustained dry conditions.

Combined, Lakes Powell and Mead are forecast later this year to hit their lowest levels since the two reservoirs filled decades ago.

As exceptional drought conditions expanded to more than 65% of the watershed’s total land area in 2020, operational forecasts for the Colorado River have worsened dramatically. Between Oct. and Nov. 2020, Bureau of Reclamation models projected a possible one million acre-foot drop in Lake Powell’s water storage due to lagging snowpack totals and record-setting soil moisture deficits.

“That was the first glimmer we could be looking at this way earlier than we expected,” said Amy Haas, executive director of the Upper Colorado River Commission.

The drought contingency plans place much of the authority to direct the response in the Department of Interior Secretary. While Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico has been nominated for the post, the position is currently vacant. So too is the position of Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, which means much of the drought response coordination is happening at the regional director level, something the drought contingency plans allowed for, Haas said."
13,2021-01-22 00:00:00,It's official: All of Nebraska is in drought for the first time in nearly 8 years,https://omaha.com/weather/its-official-all-of-nebraska-is-in-drought-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-8/article_62da7066-56bc-11eb-b897-b31e1244178c.html,"For the first time in nearly eight years, 100% of Nebraska is in drought.
This year, extreme drought affects about 25% of Nebraska, whereas in late April 2013, more than 75% was in that bad a shape or worse.
In Iowa, a little more than a third of the state is in drought, according to the Drought Mitigation Center.
Some parts of south-central Nebraska have seen an improvement, even though they remain in drought.
More important are spring and early summer, the region’s highest precipitation months, she said.","conditions, weather, state, near, week, nebraska, drought, official, precipitation, according, nearly, months",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"For the first time in nearly eight years, 100% of Nebraska is in drought.

The last time that was the case was at the end of April 2013, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a drought-tracking system developed by the National Drought Mitigation Center, housed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

To be sure, this year’s drought is nowhere near as severe as it was in 2013. At that time, the state was beginning to recover from the historic flash drought of 2012, which occurred in the midst of the state’s hottest, driest year on record. This year, extreme drought affects about 25% of Nebraska, whereas in late April 2013, more than 75% was in that bad a shape or worse.

In Iowa, a little more than a third of the state is in drought, according to the Drought Mitigation Center.

The figures were released late last week and are based on conditions as of Tuesday.

Cindy Fay, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Hastings, said changing conditions vary across the state. Some parts of south-central Nebraska have seen an improvement, even though they remain in drought. That variation is likely to continue, she said.

The Grand Island area saw 131% of normal precipitation in November and December, according to her office. In the Omaha metro area, precipitation ran at 113% of normal for those two months, according to the weather service.

The good news is that winter typically doesn’t drive drought, she said. More important are spring and early summer, the region’s highest precipitation months, she said. Those months will prove crucial in any improvement or deterioration in conditions.

Still, the state saw a rough reminder last week of the dangers of winter drought, she said.

With no snow cover on the ground, dry conditions, low humidity and extraordinary winds, two fast-moving grass fires broke out, near Guide Rock and Benkelman.

“Once the fires developed, they were able to spread very rapidly,” she said.

The town of Benkelman was hastily evacuated, but firefighters were able to stop that fire before it reached the community. The fire near Guide Rock tracked for about 8 miles before it was extinguished.

Dust storms also were a problem last week because of dry conditions, lack of snow and strong winds.

There’s no sign of significant moisture in the immediate forecast, but Fay said there are indications of renewed precipitation later in the month.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

About 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of drought and flooding in 2020, a survey conducted in seven states of the country has shown.

The analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions.

It said 52.60 per cent ""were somewhat affected and a fifth (21.1 per cent) were not affected by drought and flooding in the year under review.""

The survey, titled: ""Nigerians just want to eat"" and published this month, chronicled the major challenges bedevilling Nigerian farmers and food transporters which are capable of impeding national food security.

Survey

Data for the survey were sampled from seven Nigerian states, namely; Nasarawa, Osun, Benue, Oyo, Katsina, Ogun and Lagos.

Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (farmers) had their farms in the South-west States (73.7 per cent)--Lagos (36.8 per cent ), Oyo (21.1 per cent ) and Ogun (15.8 per cent ) .

Meanwhile, 10.5 per cent of the respondents had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were equally distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

The farmers surveyed were mostly crop farmers who grew a wide range of staples with fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize farmers in the majority, the report noted.

Scourge

According to the survey, extreme climatic events such as flooding and drought witnessed in some states within the country triggered the negative effects being noticed on the prices of staple foods.

It said flooding in Nigeria was experienced in the north, mostly in states like Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, and some parts of Kwara.

""In fact, in Kebbi alone, 500,000 hectares of farmland were destroyed by flooding, with the cost being upward of N5 billion,"" the report said.

Also, it stated that the problem that faced farmers in the South-western region was the lack of rainfall experienced during the mid-planting season last year.

""Last year, the 'August break' actually began in early July and lasted through till the end of August. This prevented the planting of maize, cassava and cash crops like cocoa,"" the survey added.

According to the survey, ""more than half of the farmers engaged had no irrigation system, even when they believed that it will help greatly in their farming endeavours.""

It said 57.90 per cent of the respondents said ""they do not own any irrigation system that could help complement the absence of rainfall when asked if they have, only 42.10 per cent had"".

""However, about 94.7 per cent of the respondents agreed to a large extent that an irrigation system would help their farming system while 10.5 per cent said it would only help to a small extent and 5.3 per cent said to no extent,"" it added.

The survey said most farmers are getting discouraged over their inability to own irrigation systems or the technology of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to support crops during adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations

In order to mitigate the challenges being faced by these farmers and food transporters, the report recommends that both state and federal governments adopt ""wider irrigation systems and as well facilitate the provision of early maturing and drought-resistant crop varieties.""

""Switching to climate-smart agriculture is the best way to guard against crop failure and poor yields,"" the survey reads in part.

The report said respondents asked the government to fix access roads and provide adequate transportation that is cheap, effective and efficient.

""An efficient rail system will reduce the cost of transporting farm produce to the markets and improve food security. Security remains paramount followed by access to land and irrigation infrastructure,"" the report quoted the farmers to have said."

The U.S. drought monitor shows key cattle producing states are also seeing dry conditions expand, an issue that could play into the cattle markets this year.","conditions, prices, cattle, markets, catalyst, weather, think, 2021, real, utterback, crop, acreage, drought, demand",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"U.S. farmers are facing a changing scenario for 2021. From wet conditions impeding farmers’ planting decisions in places for 2020, to now drought concerns creeping in, one analyst thinks weather could be a major market mover in 2021.

“The real focus, I'd say by early March will shifting to our spring planting,” says Bob Utterback, of Utterback Marketing.

He says planted acreage will play a role in the markets, with acreage possibly exceeding expectations. Between enticing prices and drier weather conditions that could allow for seamless planting, Utterback thinks acreage could expand either in the northern Plains or the South. However, the bigger event for the markets could be dry conditions expanding, especially with tight supplies.

“The thing that really catches my eye is while we could talk acreage increase, I think USDA is way too high with 50.5 soybean yield starting out. So, the real risk I think is not the demand side, is not the acres, it's the yield variance,” he explains. “And if we get anything below 49.5 or 50 [bushels per acre] U.S. average beans yields per the forecast in June and July, I think the implied volatility will drive the out of the money call options through the roof.”

Utterback says the main question floating around the markets today is how much higher prices need to go before demand rationing could occur. Whether it’s livestock producers shutting down because of high feed costs, or ethanol plants shuttering production, demand issues could eat into commodity prices if demand issues surface later this year.

Row crop farmers aren’t the only sector in U.S. agriculture concerned about drought. The U.S. drought monitor shows key cattle producing states are also seeing dry conditions expand, an issue that could play into the cattle markets this year.

“It's going to be a huge influence,” says Don Close, a senior analyst, Rabo AgriFinance. “While we certainly saw some effects of that is the western half of the US has been under drought conditions for almost a year now, the real critical component of this going forward is not only the dryness in Nebraska and Kansas, but is if we see this dry weather move across the southern states and goes across more of Texas and Oklahoma and then into the southeast complex. That could really be the catalyst that stimulates an escalation in liquidation.”

The region was 15.7 inches below average for precipitation during the last water year, meaning the region is about 22.9 inches behind normal, Anderson said.
“These are storms that go on one after another after another dropping 4 to 5 feet of snow,” Anderson said.
“If it turns out this winter is a bust, we’re now in the second year of a drought,” Anderson said.","headed, region, water, average, inches, second, low, snowpack, drought, tahoe, snow, anderson, area, nevada",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"Northern Nevada and the eastern Sierra are entering the start of what could be a second drought year as area snowpack is already below normal.

As of Monday morning, snowpack was 71 to 78 percent of median in the Lake Tahoe, Truckee and Carson basins.

In the Tahoe basin, there is an average of 7.2 inches of water content at measuring sites, down from the usual median amount of 10 inches.

At Mt. Rose, there are 9.2 inches of water content in 36 inches of snow -- the median is usually 14.5 inches of water.

A series of storms this week could drop the equivalent of 1 inch of water in the mountains and boost those numbers about 10 percent, but “it doesn’t make up for the fact that we are behind where should be,” said Jeff Anderson, hydrologist for the National Resource Conservation Service Nevada, which measures annual snowpack.

Data collected so far this year show that precipitation totals are already 7.2 inches below average for the water year, which started October 1.

The region was 15.7 inches below average for precipitation during the last water year, meaning the region is about 22.9 inches behind normal, Anderson said. An average water year brings 44.1 inches of moisture to the mountains.

The area relies on three to four large atmospheric rivers annually to produce substantial snowpack.

“These are storms that go on one after another after another dropping 4 to 5 feet of snow,” Anderson said.

The region hasn’t seen one since winter of 2019-20, according to the National Weather Service.

With last year’s drought, the region started drawing down on area reservoirs. Anderson said if this year stays below average and next year is also a drought year, local water users will feel the effects such as reduced water allocations or conservation measures.

Lake Tahoe is currently at 43 percent of capacity, down from 74 percent last year. Truckee Basin reservoirs, including Donner, Independence, Stampede, Boca and Prosser, are at 41 percent of capacity, down from 75 percent last year, and Lahontan Reservoir is at just 23 percent of capacity, down from 51 percent last year.

A side effect of the dry year the region has experienced so far is that a lack of rain in the mountains prior to recent snowstorms left the soil dry under the snow. In the spring, the first inch of two of snow will seep into the ground rather than into area streams, continuing to impact reservoir levels.

“If it turns out this winter is a bust, we’re now in the second year of a drought,” Anderson said. “Conditions are getting more serious for needing a good snowpack.”

Humanity has been stalked by the deadly spectra of drought long before carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel caused global warming but observational data on Earth and from satellites has left no doubt that climate change is boosting their duration and intensity.

The possible consequences came sharply into view when reservoirs supplying Cape Town, South Africa a city of 3.7 million ran dry in early 2018 after a multi-year drought, giving rise to the term “Day Zero"" when water runs out.

Global warming to date just over one degree Celsius since the mid-19th century enhances the likelihood of such droughts around Cape Town by a factor of three, earlier research has shown, GRACE satellite data

Allowing temperatures to increase another degree to 2C above pre-industrial levels would triple the risk again.

Mexico City is currently facing a water crisis, and California has been coping with a lack of rain for most of the last decade.

“There are growing concerns that many regions of the world will face water crises like these in the coming decades,"" Pokhrel and colleague Farshid Felfelani said in a commentary published in The Conversation.

Pokhrel and an international team of two dozen hydrologists and engineers calculated for the first time the future impact of climate change on so-called terrestrial water storage (TWS), which is the total of all water stored or available on land.

Earlier projections of drought and changes in water availability have been based mostly on river flows, and only provide a partial picture. “Understanding the risks ahead requires looking at the entire landscape of terrestrial water storage — not just rivers, but also water stored in soils, groundwater, snowpack, forest canopies, wetlands, lakes and reservoirs,"" Pokhrel explained.

The researchers used a basket of hydrological models along with terrestrial water storage data from NASA’s twin Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, which operated for 15 years up to 2017. To assess the impact of climate change, the scientists ran the data through two climate scenarios from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

One assumes that humanity ratchets down CO2 and methane emissions enough to cap global warming below two degrees Celsius, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The other assumes a slower reduction in carbon pollution.

Under the first, more optimistic scenario, moderate to severe droughts increase to mid-century and then stabilise. Very extreme water-shortage droughts, however, continue to escalate in frequency.

Under the second scenario, known as RCP6.0, “people living under extreme and exceptional droughts could more than double by 2100, increasing from three percent in the recent past to eight percent,"" said Pokhrel.

But much of the state remains in “exceptional” drought status. That’s been hard on wildlife. Natural ponds and stock tanks have dried up. A nonprofit group of hunters and conservationists is trying to help by refilling those watering holes for the benefit of elk and other animals. KNAU’s Melissa Sevigny spoke with Steve Clark, executive director of the Arizona Elk Society, about the program.

Tell me a little bit about how this program works.

The Arizona Elk Society is a wildlife conservation organization. We specialize all of our resources on elk… We started in 2001, we started hauling water. 2002 was a huge drought year also. We actually jumped in as volunteers and grabbed some trailers and went out and stated hauling water. It kind of progressed from there. For the first 5-6 years it was very informal, we just did it as volunteers, people that loved to be out there and help the elk. Obviously when you’re hauling the water for elk, you’re benefitting all the wildlife. Including the bees, the birds, the bats, all kinds of things. It’s awesome… we’ve had times when the bees have swarmed the water when we’re putting it in, we’ve had times when the birds, just hundreds and hundreds of birds landed on the fence all of the sudden, waiting for us to leave. So back in about 2006 we met with Game and Fish, and said, listen you guys are hauling water and we’re hauling water, maybe we should work together…. So we made an agreement with them to say, we will take care of these units around Flagstaff, because we have some great volunteers in Flagstaff… so we wanted to do northern Arizona.

Can you tell me what the conditions are like on the rangeland this year?

This is the worst year in history, in recorded history. There’s no doubt. I saw a report the other day that showed that 73 percent of the state is in dire need. That’s the worst it’s ever been… Water is obviously the key to life…. In a drought there’s zero water. The ranchers are hauling water, the towns are hauling water. Everybody’s hauling water right now. If these wildlife didn’t have water, they have nowhere to go.

Where does the water come from and who pays for that?

We pay for most of the water, we have accounts with the City of Flagstaff to haul effluent water, all the water that goes to golf courses, things like that, we have access to that water. We have to pay for it. It’s relatively inexpensive. Bearizona stepped up this year because they’ve got a well, they’ve got a huge resource for water, they donated a lot of water… Tusayan Sanitation, they also have effluent water they let us have access to. We pay for that.

We usually think of wildlife as being wild and not really needing our help, why is it necessary to haul water sometimes?

The caveat to that is that during this drought, now they don’t have feed, which is even worse. Now they don’t have food. Elk and antelope and others migrate from high country to low country, so we adjust where we haul water, sometimes we haul near the Grand Canyon, sometimes we haul way down at the lower elevations because that’s where the elk go to…. Elk will go 6, 8 miles to get water. It’s a pretty big area. But if there’s no water… I have a picture of one of our members who found an elk that was so thirsty it let him water him out of a bottle. They elk drank out of the bottle because he couldn’t find water. They basically die. As conservationists we can’t let that happen, whether it’s a hunted species or non-hunted species. That’s not what we do.

Steve Clark, thanks so much for speaking with me.

Thank you very much for having us."

MERILLE, Kenya, Feb 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sitting under a low tree to escape the blazing Kenyan sun, Kaltuma Milkalkona and two young men hunch intently over the older woman's smartphone - but they are not transfixed by the latest sports scores or a trending internet meme.

The men instead are looking at a weather alert for their village in the country's north, sent through an app that uses weather station data to help pastoralists prepare for drought.

The myAnga app on Milkalkona's phone showed that Merille would continue facing dry weather and that ""pasture conditions (were) expected to be very poor with no grass and browse availability.""

One of the young men said he would warn his older brother, who had taken the family's livestock to another area where there was water and pasture, not to come home yet.

Milkalkona, 42, who lives and sells clothing in the neighbouring town of Laisamis, said she often shared data from her phone with others who did not have smartphones.

""When I get the weather alerts, I usually show the people who are close to me,"" she said, as well as calling others in more distant villages.

Extreme and erratic weather linked to a warming climate can be devastating for Kenya's pastoralists, with prolonged droughts making it difficult to find enough pasture for their animals.

But armed with up-to-date weather information and advice, herders can plan ahead to ensure their livestock make it through the region's frequent dry spells, said Frankline Agolla, co-founder of Amfratech, a Nairobi-based social enterprise that developed the myAnga app.

The app - its name means ""my weather"" - goes further than the weather reports anyone can get from the meteorological department by interpreting them and making recommendations to herders on the best way to protect their livelihoods.

""If there is an imminent drought, we advise them to sell their livestock early to reduce their losses,"" said Agolla in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""If a rainy season is coming, we tell them to ensure they do not cross rivers that are flooded and also to vaccinate their animals because diseases like Rift Valley Fever might be coming,"" he said.

STOCKING UP

More than 500 herders in Marsabit and Isiolo counties have enlisted with the free service since it launched in 2018 and about 2,000 more benefit indirectly through shared weather information within communities, Agolla said.

The app is part of Amfratech's Climate Livestock and Markets (CLIMARK) project, which the company aims to roll out to more than 300,000 pastoralists in Kenya over the next five years, with funding and other help from partners including the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation and the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council.

The app sends out weekly weather information in English, Swahili and other languages used in northern Kenya, and users can see forecasts for areas as small as a single village, Agolla said.

Herders without smartphones can subscribe to a toll-free number and have weekly weather alerts sent to them by text message, he added.

Milkalkona said the app has helped women prepare their families for looming drought by, for instance, allowing them to stock up in advance on food.

Now when a dry spell hits, mothers in her community no longer have to walk long distances with their children to where the herds are grazing to get goat milk, she said.

VIRTUAL WEATHER STATIONS

The information myAnga sends out is sourced from weather data company aWhere, which uses data from global meteorological stations and satellites to generate a grid of virtual weather stations spaced out in 9km-by-9km cells covering the globe.

""Weather is a big issue for pastoralists and all of us in northern Kenya. In case of an emergency like prolonged drought, pastoralists need to know where they can take their animals for pasture and water,"" said Mamo Jarso, a health worker at a hospital in Laisamis.

Jarso, who owns a herd of livestock and uses the myAnga app, said previously, when drought set in, communities used to send scouts to walk up to 120 km (75 miles) from home looking for pasture and water.

It would be days before the scouts brought back word of where herders should take their animals, and by that time some livestock would be dead, while others would be too emaciated to make the journey.

Now the app can tell pastoralists exactly where they should head to find pasture, saving them time and potentially the lives of their cattle, Jarso said.

It also lets communities keep track of where the pastoralists and herds have gone, he added, which helps in getting veterinary services to ailing animals, as well as immunizing the herds against disease outbreaks.

LOW LITERACY

For Daniel Kapana, chairman of the Merille Livestock Market, one of the largest in northern Kenya, the myAnga app is not reaching as many pastoralists as it should.

Few herders have smartphones, he said, and the poor communication networks in some rural areas make it impossible for them to use the app.

He also pointed to the low literacy rate among Kenya's pastoralists as one of the biggest obstacles to scaling up the project.

According to Kenya's statistics agency, Marsabit County reports among the worst education indicators in the country, with literacy levels at about 20%.

""The system should be upgraded to enable a large majority of pastoralists to access weather information,"" said Kapana.

He suggested the use of infographics and illustrations so that even those who cannot read or write could still understand the information.

Agolla said the project is in its early stages and, in the future, will try to find a way to make its weather data accessible to everyone.

But he said the technology represented a huge advance from the past, when communities might look at the behavior of birds or frogs, or slaughter a goat and examine its insides, to try to determine whether it would rain.

Milkalkona agreed.

""The app is a game changer for us, because the traditional weather forecasts pastoralists relied on were mostly inaccurate,"" she said.

The all-American matchup at the Australian Open between Taylor Fritz and Reilly Opelka ended in the middle of the night in the United States, which meant few back home saw their entertaining five-set marathon.

That’s nothing new — U.S. men’s tennis hasn’t been prime-time material for years.

The last American man to win a Grand Slam tournament was Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open in 2003, and there’s no sign the drought will end anytime soon. Fritz, who rallied to beat Opelka in Melbourne on Wednesday, was the only seeded American man when the tournament began, and he’s 27th.

Only three Yanks are ranked in the top 50.

“For a country this big, with these resources, it doesn’t make sense,” said longtime coach Rick Macci, who helped develop Roddick, the Williams sisters and reigning Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin. “But I don’t see it being what it once was ever again.”

Opelka, for one, isn’t surprised the United States has the same number of seeded men in Melbourne as, say, Bulgaria or Norway.

“It’s just not that big of a sport in the States,” Opelka said. “It’s just the reality of it. The States doesn’t care that much about tennis.”

The sport enjoyed a higher profile when Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Jim Courier were winning championships, including four in a row at the Australian Open in the 1990s. But while countries in Eastern Europe and Asia have emerged as forces, the sport’s popularity has declined in the United States — especially among young boys who dream instead of winning trophies in the NFL or NBA.

The outlook is much rosier in women’s tennis. The United States has four seeded women in Melbourne, including Kenin and Serena Williams. Nine Americans are ranked in the top 50, among them 16-year-old prodigy Coco Gauff.

There are no Coco Gauffs on the men’s side.

“Tennis is still a delicious thing on the menu for a female athlete in this country,” Macci said. “It’s different for the guys. If I had LeBron James at age 10, there’s no doubt in my mind I could have gotten him to No. 1 in the world.”

Macci, who runs a tennis academy in Boca Raton, Florida, questions the structure of the U.S. developmental program. He said future great athletes can be identified when they’re still in grade school, and recruiting them for tennis would be the best way to bolster the men’s game in America.

“If I ran the show, I would hunt for those needles in the haystack,” Macci said. “I would identify the best athletes — running, jumping, height, genetics — at 7, 8, 9 years old, and then put them with the best coaches.

“Why put money into an average horse when you should be putting it on a thoroughbred? It’s not that complicated. This is the only way it’s going to change.”

Hall of Famer Butch Buchholz has watched the landscape shift since he was a top professional in the 1960s before starting the tournament now known as the Miami Open in 1985. He agreed the sport could do a better job of recruiting young talent, especially in the inner city.

“You have to convince these kids that tennis is an OK sport for them,” Buchholz said. “I don’t know if we have reached deep enough to find the best athletes. That’s a challenge, because those kids want to play basketball and football.”

The United States Tennis Association has inner-city programs in more than 250 locations. But the expense of the sport creates a challenge, as does the need for championship-quality coaching, said Martin Blackman, general manager of player development for the USTA.

As for trying to find needles in the haystack, Blackman said Macci’s ability to project the potential of 7-year-olds is rare.

“That’s not a strategy. That’s not scalable,” Blackman said. “To move the dial and get better athletes into the game has to be a programmatic effort.”

The USTA developmental program “is probably the best in the world,” Blackman said, and he’s optimistic there will soon be a payoff at the top of the men’s game. He said at least half a dozen Americans possess top-10 potential, and the United States has 16 boys ranked in the top 100 in juniors, more than any other country.

At the moment, the great American hope might be 20-year-old Sebastian Korda, a former world No. 1 junior and the son of 1998 Australian Open champion Petr Korda. Another player who could conceivably end the Grand Slam drought is the 6-foot-11 Opelka, a former Wimbledon juniors champion whose dominating serve makes him a threat anywhere.

Opelka (ranked 38th), Fritz (ranked 31st), Tommy Paul (53rd) and Frances Tiafoe (64th) are all 23 and good friends who root for each other. Fritz said he’s confident one of them can break through and win a major title.

“One hundred percent,” Fritz said. “I don’t think any of us are anywhere near our full potential. Reilly, Frances and Tommy, especially those three guys — they’re so far away from where they’re going to be. So I think it’s just a matter of time for all of us.”

Perhaps. “You better not mess with the U.S. male,” Elvis Presley once sang.

But that song is an oldie.

The usually low-maintenance crop is looking far too meager for this time of the year.

“Perhaps it will grow better when the rain comes,” says the 69-year-old, who lives in Xi’an, a village in Yongjia County. It’s something he’s been waiting on for months. Zhejiang, a coastal province of countless rivers cutting through green hills, is in the middle of a historic drought.

Xi’an sits on the Nanxi River, whose calm nature belies its vital importance to the region, supplying water to over 2 million people. The lack of rain, beginning in October, has caused water levels to drop so low that parts of the Nanxi no longer flow, exposing the riverbed’s pale stones.

There hasn’t been any water for several months. - Jin Xiuli, villager

“There hasn’t been any water for several months,” says Jin Xiuli, another Xi’an villager, while holding a rope that’s tied to a foraging sheep. The 68-year-old complains that his cabbages are wilting. “This year’s drought has lasted the longest,” he says. “The weather has changed.”

Such conditions are affecting about three-quarters of Zhejiang, a province the size of South Korea, according to Lei Yuan, senior engineer at the Zhejiang Meteorological Service Center. “According to our monitoring, we’re looking at a province-wide drought here,” she says. While fall and winter always see less rain than the rest of the year, it’s usually not dry enough to declare a drought. But the average rainfall since October has been 70% lower compared with the same period last year, Lei says. Many cities in Zhejiang have issued wildfire warnings.

Other areas along China’s southern coast — including Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi — have also seen limited rainfall and regional drought this winter, affecting several million people, according to official statistics. The Ministry of Water Resources announced Thursday it had sent officials to the affected regions, and that it is allocating disaster relief funds to safeguard people’s water supply.

“It is surely an unusual phenomenon,” says Wu Bingyi, a climate scientist at Fudan University in Shanghai. He explains that one major factor is La Niña, the cool phase of a recurring weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean that influences precipitation. Another variable is the loss of sea ice in the warming Arctic, which has been linked to cold spells across Eurasia and less rainfall in Southern China.

Zhejiang’s drought should be examined in the larger context of climate change, Wu says, but whether the current conditions will recur more often in the future requires further research. “I think phenomena like this should be taken seriously and given the attention they deserve,” he says.

China has seen several bouts of unusual weather this winter, including cold snaps in December followed by rapid warming. On Saturday, Zhengzhou, a city in the central Henan province that usually has bitterly cold winters, recorded a daily high temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. Such dramatic temperature swings in winter are “among the important manifestations of global warming,” Wu says.

The lack of water and relatively extreme weather were reportedly among the reasons for a bout of power outages across China in December, as the cold spurred electricity demand but hydropower reservoirs weren’t full enough to help increase the supply. In Yongjia, too, the local government has stopped its 44 hydropower stations to hold as much water as possible.

To alleviate drought, local governments in Zhejiang have been trying to use weather modification techniques such as firing rockets that spread moisture-attracting silver iodide particles into the sky, but with limited effect. In Wenzhou, the city that administers Yongjia County, the local state-owned newspaper has called the current predicament “the worst” fall and winter drought in the 72-year history of the People’s Republic.

In Yueqing, a hilly county on the coast of the East China Sea that is also administered by Wenzhou, water shortages have been so severe that local authorities have resorted to rationing. Since 2012, Yueqing’s 1.3 million people have relied on water diverted from the Nanxi, which flows through Yongjia County some 25 kilometers inland. But after the river’s water level began dropping, Yongjia cut off supplies in November.

Before, we’d take showers. Now we use buckets to wash ourselves. - Jiang Junlin, Yueqing resident

That meant Yueqing had to fully rely on its water reservoirs until April, when authorities predict the spring rainy season will begin alleviating the drought. To save water, residential areas receive one full day of water and then four days of intermittent supply, according to a government notice — though the reality on the ground seems to differ from one area to another. Supplies to companies will be limited, or cut off entirely in the cases of certain businesses such as swimming pools and saunas.

At Zhongqian Water Reservoir, the second-largest in Yueqing County, the water stands at an all-time low, not even reaching the concrete where the dam starts. A pagoda-shaped lookout platform built to jut out over the reservoir lake is now above dry land. On the dam, white discoloration meters above the current water level underscores how dire the drought has become.

Jiang Junlin, a manager at a local electronic appliances factory, tells Sixth Tone that one way he and his family have adapted to the situation is by cutting back on their personal hygiene, washing themselves once every two days to save water. “Before, we’d take showers. Now we use buckets to wash ourselves,” he says.

Jiang remembers how anxious he was when he heard diversions from the Nanxi River would be cut off in November. When the first water cut in his township happened not long after, Jiang immediately bought buckets to store water and persuaded the landlord to install a water pump to fill a rooftop water tank, something many Yueqing families now rely on during dry spells.

Zhao, another resident, says she regrets that her family won’t be able to do their annual house-cleaning, a tradition to ring in the Lunar New Year, which starts on Thursday. “We’ll just use a rag to wipe things down,” says the Yueqing native, who declined to give her full name. “There have been droughts before, but they were never this serious.”

In some parts of the county, water storage contraptions can be seen on the roadside. “The guys selling water buckets have made a small fortune!” jokes Huang, the owner of a car wash service in Liushi, a township in Yueqing. Huang, who also declined to give her full name, says they have to buy expensive water pumped from a private well because government policies for water-intensive businesses mean the shop’s water pipes have been completely shut off.

The national weather service forecast rain for the coming days, which could improve soil moisture levels somewhat but won’t end the drought conditions, says Lei of the Zhejiang Meteorological Service Center. “The whole situation of severe water shortage may not get better until the rainy season comes.”

The government's Cannabis Licensing Authority - which has authorised 29 cultivators and issued 73 licences for transportation, retail, processing and other activities - said there is no shortage of marijuana in the regulated industry.","farmers, marijuana, legal, rains, faces, shortage, say, jamaica, ganja, followed, heavy, drought, worst, small, pot",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"Jamaica is facing a marijuana shortage, in what has been described as a 'cultural embarrassment'.

Heavy rains followed by an extended drought, an increase in local consumption and a drop in the number of marijuana farmers have caused a shortage in the island's famed but largely illegal market that experts say is the worst they have seen.

'It's a cultural embarrassment,' said Triston Thompson, chief opportunity explorer for Tacaya, a consulting and brokerage firm for the country's fledgling legal cannabis industry.

Jamaica, which foreigners have long associated with pot, reggae and Rastafarians, authorised a regulated medical marijuana industry and decriminalised small amounts of weed in 2015.

Heavy rains followed by an extended drought, an increase in local consumption and a drop in the number of marijuana farmers have caused a shortage in the island's famed but largely illegal market that experts say is the worst they have seen. (Above, a farmer with a marijuana plant during a tour of his plantation in Jamaica's central mountain town of Nine Mile in 2013)

People caught with 2oz (56g) or less of cannabis are supposed to pay a small fine and face no arrest or criminal record.

The island also allows individuals to cultivate up to five plants, and Rastafarians are legally allowed to smoke ganja for sacramental purposes.

But enforcement is patchy as many tourists and locals continue to buy marijuana on the street, where it has grown more scarce - and more expensive.

Heavy rains during last year's hurricane season pummelled marijuana fields that were later scorched in the drought that followed, causing tens of thousands of dollars in losses, according to farmers who cultivate pot outside the legal system.

'It destroyed everything,' said Daneyel Bozra, who grows marijuana in the south west of Jamaica, in a historical village called Accompong founded by escaped 18th-century slaves known as Maroons.

Worsening the problem were strict Covid-19 measures, including a 6pm curfew that meant farmers could not tend to their fields at night as is routine, said Kenrick Wallace, 29, who cultivates two acres in Accompong with the help of 20 other farmers.

He noted that a lack of roads forces many farmers to walk to reach their fields - and then to get water from wells and springs. Many were unable to do those chores at night due to the curfew.

Mr Wallace estimated he lost more than $18,000 in recent months and cultivated only 300lb, compared with an average of 700lb to 800lb the group normally produces.

Activists say the pandemic and a loosening of Jamaica's marijuana laws have led to an increase in local consumption that has contributed to the scarcity, even if the pandemic has put a dent in the arrival of ganja-seeking tourists.

'Last year was the worst year. We've never had this amount of loss,' Mr Thompson said. 'It's something so laughable that cannabis is short in Jamaica.'

Paul Burke, chief executive of Jamaica's Ganja Growers and Producers Association, said people are no longer afraid of being locked up now the government allows possession of small amounts.

He said the stigmatisation of ganja has diminished and more people are appreciating its claimed therapeutic and medicinal value during the pandemic.

Mr Burke also said some traditional small farmers have stopped growing in frustration because they cannot afford to meet requirements for the legal market while police continue to destroy what he described as 'good ganja fields'.

The government's Cannabis Licensing Authority - which has authorised 29 cultivators and issued 73 licences for transportation, retail, processing and other activities - said there is no shortage of marijuana in the regulated industry.

However, farmers and activists say weed sold at legal dispensaries - known as herb houses - is out of reach for many, given that it still costs five to 10 times more than pot on the street."

Salah had gone six league games without scoring until he broke West Ham's resistance in the second half with his first goal in the competition since December.

The 28-year-old followed that fine strike with another eye-catching effort and his masterclass ensured Liverpool made it two successive league wins.

Salah is the first player to score at least 20 goals in all competitions in four consecutive seasons for Liverpool since Ian Rush in the 1980s.

Georginio Wijnaldum grabbed Liverpool's third as Jurgen Klopp's side moved above Leicester into third place.

Liverpool are four points adrift of leaders Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and one behind second placed Manchester United.

After five league games without a win, the champions showed signs of emerging from their winter slump in Thursday's 3-1 success at Tottenham and this was another step in the right direction.

Liverpool's previous away league wins this season had come at Chelsea and Crystal Palace and they inflicted more capital punishment on West Ham in their latest trip to London.

West Ham had won their last six games in all competitions and were unbeaten in their last six league matches. But Liverpool squashed that streak emphatically, proving that the group who swept to the title last season shouldn't be written off yet.

The Reds are rounding into form just in time for next Sunday's crucial clash with Manchester City, which is preceded by a home game against Brighton on Wednesday.

Salah shines

Liverpool forward Sadio Mane was absent due to a muscle injury suffered against Tottenham, while Roberto Firmino was left on the bench as Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri started in attack.

With Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Joel Matip and Fabinho all out injured, Nat Phillips came in alongside midfielder Jordan Henderson in Liverpool's makeshift central defence. At least Liverpool's full-backs remain healthy and Andrew Robertson combined with Trent Alexander-Arnold to set up Wijnaldum for a shot that flashed just over.

Liverpool created little else in the first half and Pablo Fornals almost put West Ham ahead when his goalbound shot was nodded away by Robertson.

Liverpool didn't manage a single shot on target until first half stoppage-time when Salah's speculative effort was held by Lukasz Fabianski. But Salah almost broke the deadlock early in the second half as the Egyptian met Origi's cross with a close-range shot that was blocked by Aaron Cresswell's last-ditch challenge.

“We think this study provides the scientific support needed to punctuate the immediate threat posed by drought,” Cai said.","regions, different, southwest, water, climate, drought, cai, risk, southeastern, study, bureau",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. —Many climate models focus on scenarios decades into the future, making their outcomes seem unreliable and problematic for decision-making in the immediate future. In a proactive move, researchers are using short-term forecasts to stress the urgency of drought risk in the United States and inform policymakers’ actions now.

A new study led by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign civil and environmental engineering professor Ximing Cai examines how drought propagates through climate, hydrological, ecological and social systems throughout different U.S. regions. The results are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

“The same amount of precipitation, or the lack of thereof, in one region could have very different impacts on the hydrologic cycle, streamflow and water storage in another region,” Cai said. “The impacts of droughts are closely related to climate and environmental characteristics, and both together can have very different impacts on human water usage and supply.”

For example, the team predicted that lack of rainfall in the Southeastern region poses a greater risk than it does in the Southwest. The Southwest has a relatively large water-storage capacity, unlike the Southeast, which has a limited storage capacity and faces increased demand. Their prediction proved accurate, according to their models.

Cai and co-author Tushar Apurv compiled previously collected meteorologic, soil and hydrologic data from 30 regions around the U.S. from the past few decades. Using this data, they calculated a ratio representing how severe the hydrologic droughts are relative to meteorological droughts in these regions. This ratio helped them determine where water availability and water supply deficits have been occurring over time.

The study reports that precipitation deficits have decreased in Northern parts of the U.S. and increased in the Southwestern and Southeastern regions due to climate change, the researchers said. As a result, the Southwest has experienced severe drought effects on ecosystems in the area in recent years, which is likely to continue into the next decade – with severe drought conditions already in place since August.

However, according to the study, the forecasted Southeastern drought could lead to a very different outcome than the Southwestern drought.

“If this trend of increasing drought severity persists, as also predicted by other studies, the Southeast could be at very high risk for extreme drought, which might not have been realized in the past,” Cai said. “This will expose their water-supply infrastructure to stress beyond its design limit.”

In other words, there is a risk that the Southeast may not be as well prepared to handle near-future drought as the Southwest, which appears to have the situation better controlled, Cai said.

The researchers plan to explore more detailed studies on some of the watersheds to help uncover solutions, but they are more eager to flag the attention of policymakers right now.

“We think this study provides the scientific support needed to punctuate the immediate threat posed by drought,” Cai said. “We see our results as an incentive for decision-makers to bring drought mitigation to the forefront of environmental and water-management policy.”

Cai also is affiliated with the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment – which supported this study – and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications."

Snow droughts can also make conditions dire in regions that are already stressed by conflict and resource shortages.
A snow drought in Afghanistan in 2017-2018 triggered crop failures and livestock loses that left 10 million people food insecure.
The most notable area was the western United States, which saw a 28% increase in the length of periods of snow drought.
Better understanding of how to measure and track snow droughts can give water managers another tool to help plan for similar droughts and to better manage this changing resource.","united, scientists, western, water, developed, states, saw, snowpack, drought, hotspot, snow, temperatures, study, droughts, revelator",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"A new study compares snowpack across the world and offers a tool to help scientists pinpoint where this critical resource is waning — and what that means for ecosystems and economies.

Most of us know a bad drought when we see one: Lakes and rivers recede from their normal water lines, crops wither in fields, and lawns turn brown. Usually we think of these droughts as being triggered by a lack of rain, but scientists also track drought in other ways.

“The common ways to measure droughts are through precipitation, soil moisture and runoff,” says Laurie S. Huning, an environmental engineer at the University of California, Irvine. Her most recent work adds another dimension to that by looking at water stored in snowpack.

Huning is the co-author of a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, with U.C. Irvine colleague Amir AghaKouchak, which developed a new framework for characterizing “snow droughts.” These can occur when there’s an abnormally low snowpack, which may be triggered by low precipitation, warm temperatures or both.

Their research is timely. This winter, southwestern states have received just a quarter to half of the average snow-water equivalent —the amount of water held in the snowpack — the key metric for determining a snow drought.

And that can have sweeping impacts. The water content of a snowpack can change the amount and timing of when runoff occurs, and that has implications for wildlife, ecosystems, water resources, flood control, hydropower and drought mitigation.

Snow droughts can also have far-reaching effects on agriculture — and economies. California’s Central Valley, the heart of its agriculture industry, relies on snow melt from the Sierra Nevada. The state saw $2.7 billion in losses in the sector following low precipitation and warm temperatures during 2014-2015.

Snow droughts can also make conditions dire in regions that are already stressed by conflict and resource shortages. A snow drought in Afghanistan in 2017-2018 triggered crop failures and livestock loses that left 10 million people food insecure.

The concept of a “snow drought” has been around for several years, and it’s been studied in certain key locations, but until now scientists and water managers lacked a worldwide method to assess them.

The study aims to solve that. Huning and AghaKouchak have developed a standardized snow-water equivalent index in an effort better characterize and compare the duration and intensity of snow droughts around the world.

The results already reveal some areas of concern. Looking at data from 1980 to 2018, the researchers found a few hotspots where snow-droughts became longer and more intense during the 21st century.

The most notable area was the western United States, which saw a 28% increase in the length of periods of snow drought. Eastern Russia and Europe also saw increases, though less severe.

And on the flip side, some areas saw a decrease in snow drought duration, including the Hindu Kush, Central Asia, greater Himalayas, extratropical Andes and Patagonia.

“It’s important to remember that not only does the snowpack vary but the impact that it has differs across the world,” says Huning.

Huning hopes the framework developed for the study can help water managers better understand the amount and timing of snowmelt, and to integrate that with drought monitoring systems to recreate better resiliency and management of resources.

“We know that the snowpack is highly variable,” she says. “Further development of this framework can improve our near real-time monitoring of drought.”

The study didn’t delve into the specifics of why snow droughts may be becoming more severe in certain places, but other studies have found that climate change is playing, and will play, a role in reducing snowpack in some areas — including western U.S. states.

A study by UCLA climate scientists published on Aug. 10 found that in California warmer temperatures will cause more rainfall and less snow during the winter in coming decades. This will likely increase flood risks and reduce the snowpack that usually melts slowly over the spring months.

Earlier research found that a decrease in Arctic sea ice leads to changes in atmospheric circulation that creates a high-pressure system, known as an atmospheric ridge, off the Pacific coast. These ridges deflect storms, pushing them northward and leaving the region high and dry. A particularly stubborn system that developed in 2013, nicknamed the “ridiculously resilient ridge,” had a big hand in California’s five-year drought, which extended until 2017.

Better understanding of how to measure and track snow droughts can give water managers another tool to help plan for similar droughts and to better manage this changing resource.

“Snow is a natural resource and, given the warming temperatures that some parts of the world will see, the amount of snow is changing,” says Huning. “We need to recognize that there are so many different ways the environment and humans will be affected.”"

Scenic Rim Lucerne co-owner Russell Jenner said there was ""not good moisture under the ground"".

""It's just green on top from people irrigating and the bit of rain we've had,"" he said.

Moogerah Dam, near Boonah, is currently at 13.2 per cent, down from nearly 15 per cent in January.

The dam hasn't been that low since just before the Millennium drought broke in 2008.

Once the water level reaches 7.5 per cent, no farmers will be allowed to draw water for irrigation.

'A green drought'

Bunjurgen Vineyard owner David McMaugh said bore water would run out soon and could not be relied on.

His was already gone, and grapevines are thirsty plants.

""You must never get to a stage where the bore becomes dry, otherwise no water will flow into it,"" he said.

""So you have to scale back the amount of water that you draw out and we've got to the stage that that's been reached so we're dependent on what falls out of the sky.

""If you were to scan around this country and people might say, 'Oh well, it looks pretty green, everything's OK,' — it's not really.

""It's a green drought — if we were to go up into the vineyard and the top of the hill here you'd see cracks you could put your fist into.""

Scenic Rim Lucerne co-owner Jenny Jenner said La Niña, a Pacific Ocean weather event that brings wetter weather, had not done enough to replenish bore water or refill dams around the region.

""The La Niña's failed us in the Fassifern and Lockyer valleys,"" she said.

""We just haven't had any decent rain this summer to put in Moogerah Dam — a lot of people's dams are empty.

""There's a good percentage of farmers who will not be able to produce what they normally do and that goes for vegetables, fodder crops, cattle, anything like that.

""Once the water runs out of the area, which happened about 15 years ago, the town sort of tends to die a little bit because the farmers can't produce as much produce.""

The Jenners will struggle to grow their main crop of lucerne hay and Mr Jenner said it would dramatically lower their production.

""Only limited amount with the bore water — not the whole farm — a lot of the farm won't have a thing on it at all,"" he said.

The Jenners and the rest of the farmers in the region are facing a year with no water at all.

Ms Jenner said he was hoping the state government had learnt from the last drought and built more water storage.

""I wish the government had more foresight to put in more water storage,"" she said.

""The urban areas are growing so much — there are so many people moving into the areas, but they're not making any more dams.

""What we really need in the produce producing areas is more water security and we need the governments to do that.""

Queensland Farmers Federation (QFF) water policy adviser Sharon McIntosh said the state government should have spent the drought-free years preparing more water storage, be it a new dam or allowing farmers to store water more easily on their farms.

She said climate change meant droughts would become worse and more frequent — so the time to act was yesterday.

""There is some slow traction happening in government in regard to climate change, however I think there still is a lot of headway that needs to be done in incorporating climate change into policy, especially water,"" Ms McIntosh said.

""We're going to have longer periods of drought and when we do have rain, we're going to have lots of it — but the issue when we have lots of rain is we've got nowhere to store it.""

Ms McIntosh said the rebates and concessions on utilities offered to farmers in drought affected regions must continue.

Farmers pivot to diversify farms, tourism bid

A spokesman for Queensland Water Minister Glenn Butcher said water providers were consulting with farmers about how to improve water security and were providing support by increasing usable water allocations and giving utilities concessions to drought declared areas.

The farmers were being tided over by the support of tourists and shoppers, encouraged by state government programs, and diversification of their farms.

Since lucerne would not do well without irrigation, the Jenners had decided to pivot to something less water intensive.

""Basically you can grow dry-land sunflowers — we haven't irrigated them at all. We have been lucky because we've had a bit of rain,"" Ms Jenner said.

""When they flower, everybody who drives through town will be able to see them and they'll make everybody happy as sunflowers do, but also create and event for the town so the businesses can enjoy some tourism coming in.""

The flowers would not be for eating, but for a festival.

Ms Jenner said she hoped to sell dinners among the flowers, yoga classes, helicopter rides, and more at the Kalbar Sunshine and Sunflowers Day to help them through an otherwise tight year.

Mr McMaugh was complimentary of the state government's 'Go Local, Grow Local' campaign and the relaxing of regulations that allowed him to sell his wine in the Scenic Rim Farm Box.

But he said the best help when the future was so uncertain was a visit and a smile.

""That activity has a big morale boost on people out here when they come out here, and they're positive and they want to buy something, and there's an opportunity for some social value there, which is difficult to quantify,"" Mr McMaugh said."

Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, said the answer largely depends on location.
“In those parts of the state, this storm wasn’t all that meaningful,” Schumacher said.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 16 percent of the state faced the most extreme category of “exceptional drought” as of last week.

But is it enough to free the state from its drought conditions?

Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, said the answer largely depends on location. The brunt of the storm hit east of the Continental Divide, dumping around two feet of snow in the Foothills and Eastern Plains. Meanwhile, preliminary snowfall reports show only a few inches accumulated on the Western Slope.

“In those parts of the state, this storm wasn’t all that meaningful,” Schumacher said. “Here on the Front Range, it was a major one.”

Colorado’s drought conditions had improved ahead of the storm. After record dry weather over the summer and fall, snowpack levels had inched toward normal throughout the winter, but western Colorado continued to miss out on the snowfall. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 16 percent of the state faced the most extreme category of “exceptional drought” as of last week. Most of that area was west of the Continental Divide.

Karl Wetlaufer, a hydrologist from the Natural Resource Conservation Service, said the weekend storm brought the entire state to 91 percent of its median snowpack for mid-March.

“This recent storm was really good not only as far as snow depth, but was a really wet, heavy snowfall,” Wetlaufer said.

The additional moisture wasn’t spread evenly, though. At midnight March 14, the South Platte River basin and Arkansas River basin had nearly hit their expected level of snowpack. River basins west of the divide remained as much as 19 percent below normal."

Officials hope the 'plum rain' season that starts around late spring will help, but in the meantime are taking more drastic steps.

In Taichung earlier this month the Water Resources Agency took the unusual step of sending its top official for central Taiwan to a three-hour religious ceremony to pray for rain, the first time the event has been held in 58 years.

The drought you hear discussed on T.V. is meteorological drought — which is based on rainfall deficit and the length of the deficit — but drought also affects water resource management, farmers, and even everyday people like you and me.

What You Need To Know There are four types of drought



Each type affects different interests



California has gone through extended drought periods recently



The current statewide drought is worsening

The four types of drought are:

Meteorological Drought

Hydrological Drought

Agricultural Drought

Socioeconomic Drought

Hydrological Drought

The National Weather Service (NWS) defines hydrological drought based on the impact of rainfall deficits on the water supply, such as stream flow, reservoir and lake levels, and ground water table decline.

You’ll often hear me say it’s more important rain fall to the north than to the south in California. I’m not against rain here in SoCal, it’s just logistics. The majority of our state’s water supply comes from reservoirs to the north — namely the Northern Sierra 8-station index, the Central Sierra 5-station index, and to a lesser extent, the Tulare Basin 6-station index.

If these indices are on track, the state is in a good spot for water supply and distribution.

Agricultural Drought

The NWS defines agricultural drought by the impacts on agriculture by factors such as rainfall deficit, soil water deficits, reduced ground water, or reservoir levels needed for irrigation.

California’s agriculture economy is huge — producing a third of the country’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruit and nuts. This multi-billion dollar industry is heavily reliant on water supply — and highly affected by hydrological drought.

Socioeconomic Drought

The NWS says socioeconomic drought considers the impact of all drought conditions — meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural — on the supply and demand of goods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and meat. Socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of weather-related deficit in water supply.

Consider the price of almonds and products like almond milk and almond butter. California produces a whopping 80 percent of the world's almonds, and supplies almonds for the entire United States.

Data shows almond orchards required 10 percent of the entire state's water supply in 2015 — due to a combination of the amount of the water the trees need and the sheer number of orchards in the state.

Severe drought will greatly affect the price of this good, thus creating a big socioeconomic impact for the United States and beyond.

Recent Persistent California Drought

California suffered a multi-year drought from 2012-2016, putting most of the state in severe, extreme, or exceptional drought.

Snowpack — which stores 65 percent of the state’s water supply — was at critically low levels and groundwater — which provides nearly half of urban and agriculture water needs during drought — was sharply depleted. Tapping groundwater excessively has also led to several feet of subsidence (sinking) in California’s Central Valley.

Current California Drought

It's been a drier than average winter for most of California. In fact, it may end up ranking in the top-ten driest years ever in Southern California.

Despite how dry it has been this year, near-average rainfall for Southern California last season has kept the drought from getting out of control to date.

March may bring near-average rainfall for the month for most of California — active weather is expected through at least the next ten days — but it won't be nearly enough to erase the meteorological drought conditions in the state."

Arizona's wildfire season starts earlier this yearArizona's wildfire season started early this year with several fires that burned more than 500 acres, Truett said.
The new $24 million multi-agency initiative will train more than 700 Arizona inmates to help prevent wildfires and create partnerships to reduce wildfire fuels.

Doug Ducey and fire officials announced Monday that the upcoming wildfire season is expected to be similar to 2020, which was reported as the second-worst wildfire season in Arizona.

""We have more vegetation on the ground this year that can act as a fuel for wildfires, so we’re already seeing a heightened risk to our communities,"" Ducey said in a news conference Monday.

Last year, 2,520 wildfires burned nearly 1 million acres across state, federal and tribal lands and was one of the worst fire seasons in a decade, according to the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management. More than 80% of the fires were human-caused, but fire officials say vegetation overgrowth, an ongoing drought and lack of rain during the monsoon season also contributed to the increase in fires.

The Bush Fire became the state's fifth-largest fire after it burned 193,000 acres in Tonto National Forest.

Department of Forestry Fire Management Officer John Truett said Monday that there is a ""very severe potential"" for wildland fires and rapid-fire spread across the state this year.

Arizona's wildfire season starts earlier this year

Arizona's wildfire season started early this year with several fires that burned more than 500 acres, Truett said. This month, the Punkin Fire forced the evacuation of 100 people and also closed a state route, Ducey emphasized.

""It’s going to be very important for the public to do their due diligence and prevention, watching their outdoor activities,"" Truett said. ""It’s going to be extremely dry. It won’t take much to get ignition source going and get that fired up and spread across the landscape.""

Recently, weather service and agriculture officials warned of increased wildfires in addition to potential water use cutbacks and damage to wheat crops in California and the Southwest due to an expanding drought.

The spring outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is an expanding drought with a drier than normal April, May and June for a large part of the country from Louisiana to Oregon. Most of Arizona is currently in an extreme to exceptional drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor.

More on drought:Supercharged by climate change, ‘megadrought’ points to drier future in the West

Officials said increased recreational traffic in Arizona and unseasonably warm conditions, lack of moisture and an overabundance of fuels across Arizona's central region and within the Sonoran Desert, all contributed to last year's severe wildfire season, which continued well into the fall.

The lack of rain also kept fire restrictions in place through November, fire officials said.

Ducey said Arizonans need to do their part and take common-sense precautions to help prevent fires this year such as making sure trailer chains aren't dragging, putting out campfires and protecting property by limiting combustible material and vegetation within 100 feet of a house.

Advice for preparing your home for wildfires can be found in English and Spanish on the National Fire Protection Association's website.

New initiative will train over 700 Arizona inmates to help prevent wildfires

The news conference with fire and state agencies came after Ducey signed the Arizona Healthy Forest Initiative in March to increase the number of people working to prevent fires in the state. The new $24 million multi-agency initiative will train more than 700 Arizona inmates to help prevent wildfires and create partnerships to reduce wildfire fuels.

""The Arizona Healthy Forest Initiative not only promotes a healthier and safer Arizona, but it also deeply expands the rehabilitative opportunities, which enhance offender’s post-incarceration successful reentry and transition back into our community,"" said Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry Director David Shinn at the conference.

Officials said the new initiative and partnership between the Department of Forestry and the Department of Corrections helps reduce recidivism by providing inmates with job skills for post-sentence employment.

""Cleaning up hazardous debris, they will reduce wildfire risks and create healthier and more fire-resistant forests,"" Shinn said.

The state has 43 planned and 47 in-progress wildfire risk reduction projects in place and has completed 181 reduction projects from 2013 to 2020, according to officials. The goal of the new forest initiative is to increase the number of acres receiving treatment from 4,000 to 20,000 acres annually. The projected increase in the number of acres receiving treatment under the initiative is 500%, according to the state.

Shinn said the department has partnered with the state forestry agency for 30 years and acknowledged the five inmate firefighters and Department of Corrections fire crew supervisor who died while fighting the Dude Fire in 1990.

Inmates who are part of the Department's wildfire crews have also been prioritized to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as part of the Phase 1B group, Shinn said. The current program includes about 240 inmates, according to the Department of Forestry. Officials said more than 30 of the inmates have been hired by the state since they were released.

The inmates selected for the program are the lowest-risk offenders in custody, Shinn said.

House Bill 2440 and Senate Bill 1442, introduced by state Rep. Gail Griffin and state Sen. Sine Kerr, will also help support this initiative, Ducey said. SB 1442 will help increase partnerships to reduce wildfire risks on federal lands.

""This partnership will provide critical job skills for over 700 individuals while giving our state’s lands, wildlife and communities the much-needed hazardous vegetation removal to help mitigate the damage and the danger caused by catastrophic wildfires,"" said Kerr, the primary sponsor for SB 1442.

One year later, he was needing to truck in water to battle an extreme drought. Then Australia's deadly wildfires raged perilously close in late 2019, forcing Costigan to spend day after day stamping out embers and running sprinklers on his roof to save his home, in an eerie atmosphere he likens to Armageddon.

Then last week, on the day his daughter Eva was supposed to be celebrating her 11th birthday, came the floods. Thankfully, the family had already left to stay at his brother's home.

The water roared through with such force it lifted both Costigan's farmhouse and a second home where his father-in-law lived from their foundations, destroying both. The family is still picking up toys and clothes strewn far and wide — they even found their gas barbecue bottle stuck in a tree.

“Just disbelief,” said Costigan. “It feels like the world's against us. You work your guts out and then to have it all just washed away in the blink of an eye.”

Costigan, 40, a road maintenance worker whose farm is in the Hollisdale community about a five-hour drive north of Sydney, said he's thankful that so far he's managed to avoid yet another disaster — the plague of mice that is affecting some farms in the region. Maybe, he hopes, the floods will help wash them away.

Australia has always been a land of harsh weather, where droughts and fires form part of the nation's psyche. But experts say that global warming is likely making recent weather events more extreme. The raging wildfires that burned through until early last year killed at least 33 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes.

“These events are expected,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales. “But climate change has put them on steroids.”

She explained that, paradoxically, a warming atmosphere can worsen both droughts and floods. The extra heat can suck more moisture from the ground during droughts. But warmer air can also hold more moisture, she said, so that when it does rain, it pours.

Some towns in New South Wales have set 50- or 100-year records for rainfall over the past week. The floods have killed two men in separate incidents, both of whom were trapped in their cars, and have forced more than 20,000 people from their homes.

Dale Ward this week was trying to clean out the rental apartment she owns, and where her daughter and their family live, in the town of Windsor. She said she was mopping up sludge after about 1 foot (30 centimeters) of water coursed through, destroying a box of photos and other memorabilia.

“It's like someone dropped three tons of dirt in your house, and then dropped a bucket of water over the top,” she said.

Ward estimates it will take at least a month to get the place habitable again, with plumbers and electricians needed to get everything fixed.

Elsewhere, people are still dealing with the plague of mice. Last year in eastern Australia, months of rain doused wildfires and ended a drought that had crippled the region for more than two years. That led to bumper crops on many farms, and an explosion in the mouse population.

Pompy Singh, the manager of the Spar supermarket in the town of Gulargambone, said they started to notice the number of mice increasing before Christmas. They used to set one or two traps a day, he said. They started buying much larger traps and setting many more of them until they had 20 set all the time.

Suddenly they were catching 100 or 200 mice each day. The critters began eating through everything, getting into the lettuce, the potato chips, the dog food, even the tobacco. Singh said they started storing everything in refrigerators or sealed containers.

Still, he said, the mice kept coming. Some days, they were catching up to 600. Even the fridges kept breaking down as the mice chewed through the wiring. Singh said the numbers of mice seem to have decreased somewhat since the floods hit, although they're still catching plenty.

And Australia's troubles may not yet be done. Some experts have been warning people to check their shoes and clothes for deadly spiders, as swarms of them seek refuge from the floodwaters by moving into residential homes.

Meanwhile, Costigan said he intends to rebuild. He’s spent too much time putting up fences on his farm — many of which survived the flooding — and making other improvements to give up now. He adds that he moved his small herd of cattle to higher ground before the floods hit and they all survived.

Costigan said he feels lucky his farmhouse is insured and is also thankful to family members and neighbors who have contributed to an online fund to help his family rebuild.

He said these kind of troubles all come with living in Australia, and even perhaps explain why the British initially treated the continent as a place to send their prisoners.

“They thought it was hell on earth,"" he said. “What they didn't realize is that it's a beautiful part of the world.”"

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on Wednesday declared a drought emergency in Klamath County.

Much of the south-central Oregon county is experiencing extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, and the area is entering the spring with mountain snowpack well below normal.

“The Klamath Basin faces one of the most difficult water years in recent memory,” Brown said in a press release. “Moving forward, we must look at long-term solutions to the underlying issue in Klamath and many other Oregon counties: there is too little water in the ground, and as the climate changes we are experiencing hotter, drier summers.”

Drought has become more common in this part of Southern Oregon in recent decades, which has caused tension among water users.

Precipitation this winter has been too little to make up for dry soils left by last year’s drought. The ongoing trend of drought on drought on drought could make this year the worst in some time.

Mark Johnson, deputy director of the Klamath Water Users Association, said inflows to Klamath Lake are the lowest they’ve been since the 1930s (which history buffs will recall as the era of the Dust Bowl). The lake itself is starting the spring about a foot lower than it was last year at this time.

“We’re going to be looking at any assistance available to get people through this year, especially coming off of a drought last year. The ground is just that much drier,” Johnson said. “It’s just compounding the need for more water.”

Irrigators in the Klamath Project, which supplies water to hundreds of thousands of farmed acres in the region, could receive less than a quarter of the water this year than they have historically.

The ill effects of drought reach far beyond irrigated fields to endangered salmon and suckerfish, migratory birds at the Klamath wildlife refuges, upland forestry, and more.

“It affects all aspects of the watershed,” said Bill Lehman, executive director of the Klamath Watershed Partnership. Water quantity affects water quality, and less water typically isn’t good.

“When you have multiple drought years on top of one another or back-to-back, your soil conditions, everything is dry. Your water table is lowered. All of those water quality concerns get worse.”

The Klamath County Commission declared a drought emergency in early March. The governor’s order frees up additional state resources to assist the county throughout the summer.

Johnson praised the governor for signing the emergency declaration quickly.

Johnson and Lehman both added that stakeholder groups including the Klamath Tribes (which hold water rights in the basin from time immemorial), irrigators, nonprofits and government agencies are working together to develop solutions to endure this drought year and also to find compromise for the future.

“We have to consider all of the water savings options that are available to us,” Lehman said.

Most other Oregon basins are at or above normal snowpack levels as winter gives way to spring. Still, nearly 80% of the state is experiencing some degree of drought."

The humanitarian assistance is being delivered on-board Indian Naval Ship Jalashwa, which will leave with the food and medical assistance on March 3 and is expected to reach the Port of Ehoala in Madagascar between March 21 and 24, 2021, the MEA said in a statement.

The prompt Indian assistance to the Madagascar government was conveyed by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a phone conversation with Madagascar’s Foreign Minister Tehindrazanarivelo Djacoba A S Oliva, the MEA said.

“Good conversation with FM of Madagascar @Tehindrazanari1. Informed him that Indian humanitarian assistance would be delivered in the coming days. Will include food and medical supplies,” Jaishankar tweeted after the call.

During the phone conversation, Jaishankar recalled the excellent bilateral ties of friendship between India and Madagascar, and that India has always been among the first responders when it comes to assisting the people of Madagascar in such humanitarian crises.

In response to the urgent appeal made by Madagascar for international solidarity and assistance to deal with the humanitarian crisis in South of Madagascar due to severe drought, the government is sending a consignment of 1000 metric tonnes of rice and 100,000 tablets of HCQ to Madagascar, the MEA said.

In September 2018, a consignment of 1,000 metric tonnes of rice was delivered on-board an Indian naval vessel to Madagascar.

Indian Navy was the first to respond when Cyclone Diane struck Madagascar and prompt assistance was delivered under Operation Vanilla by INS Airavat in January 2020.

In March 2020, INS Shardul visited the port of Antisiranana and delivered 600 tonnes of rice as HADR assistance to Madagascar from India for dealing with heavy floods in the Northern region of Madagascar, the statement said.

Jaishankar assured his counterpart from Madagascar that as a maritime neighbour across the Indian Ocean, the government and people of Madagascar can always count on the support and solidarity of the government and people of India.

The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of mutual interest.

During this trip, INS Jalashwa will also have on board an Indian naval training team, which is being deployed in Madagascar for capacity building and training of the Malagasy Special Forces for two weeks.

INS Jalashwa will also call at Port Anjoun in the Republic of Comoros where it will deliver a consignment of 1,000 metric tonnes of Indian rice.

The supply of this food assistance was announced by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu during his visit to Comoros in October 2019.

The supplies of food assistance and support for capacity building to the friendly countries of Madagascar and Comoros is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of SAGAR and India’s time-tested role as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region, the MEA said.



Meanwhile, Jaishankar also spoke with his New Zealand counterpart Nanaia Mahuta for the first time and discussed the COVID challenge as well as the expectations of an early recovery. “Our shared interests are expressed bilaterally and in the Indo-Pacific. Look� forward to meeting her in person,” Jaishankar tweeted.

In another tweet, Jaishankar said, “Keeping our CARICOM commitment. Made in India vaccines arrive at Antigua for Antigua & Barbuda, St Kitts & Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent & Grenadines and Suriname.”

Sources said the 40,000 doses of made-in-India vaccines arrived in St Vincent and the Grenadines and received by Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.



The external affairs minister also retweeted Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne’s tweet thanking Prime Minister Modi for the 500,000 AstraZeneca vaccines that he shared with the Caribbean to assist in the fight against COVID-19."

In California, about 90% of the state is in a drought.

The nearly-20-year drought is almost as bad or worse than any in the past 1,200 years, scientists say.

Much of the western U.S. continues to endure a long-term drought, one that threatens the region's water supplies and agriculture and could worsen wildfires this year.

In fact, some scientists are calling the dryness in the West a ""megadrought,"" defined as an intense drought that lasts for decades or longer.

Overall, about 90% of the West is now either abnormally dry or in a drought, which is among the highest percentages in the past 20 years, according to this week's U.S. Drought Monitor.

""By intensity, it would be about as bad as the U.S. Drought Monitor has shown in the last 20 years,"" climatologist Brian Fuchs of the National Drought Mitigation Center told USA TODAY.

Although some areas that saw significant snow this winter will be in better shape this year, ""those areas that did not see any help during the winter will see issues and impacts to water supplies, agriculture as well as increased fire danger,"" Fuchs said. ""We have time yet this winter to provide help, but the current situation is not providing much hope in widespread improvements by the end of spring.""

The Southwest is the area of most concern because of the drought. ""Coming off record-breaking or near-record-breaking heat and dryness in 2020, the winter has not provided much relief at all and we see the most widespread exceptional drought in this region,"" he said. Exceptional drought is the worst level of drought.

A bad year:'Megadrought' emerging in the western US might be worse than any in 1,200 years

""I would include Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Colorado as the states with the most concerns going into the summer,"" Fuchs said.

In California, about 90% of the state is in a drought, a worrisome statistic that comes a year after its most destructive wildfire season on record.

""Much of California is enduring its second consecutive dry winter, with most areas below 75% of normal snowpack for this time of year,"" the Monitor said. ""Many water agencies were discussing water conservation measures, with the North Marin Water District considering both voluntary and mandatory water conservation orders.""

Moderate drought was expanded over areas of Southern California. where drought is developing again after a fairly dry winter.

""As California closes out the fifth consecutive dry month of our water year, absent a series of strong storms in March or April we are going to end with a critically dry year on the heels of last year’s dry conditions,” Karla Nemeth, director of California's Department of Water Resources, said in a statement.

Sean de Guzman, the department’s chief of snow surveys and water supply forecasting, said California ""has experienced a series of storms over the last couple of weeks that brought a significant amount of rain and snow; however, these storms were not nearly enough to make up a deficit that we have accumulated over last few months.”

In a study published last year, scientists said a “megadrought” appears to be emerging in the western U.S., one that's being worsened by human-caused climate change. In fact, the nearly-20-year drought is almost as bad or worse than any in the past 1,200 years, scientists say.

""By definition, we are approaching what is defined as a megadrought, where conditions have been that way for at least two decades,"" Fuchs said.

Historically, megadroughts once plagued the Desert Southwest. Thanks in part to global warming, an especially fierce one appears to be coming back.

Relief agencies report two consecutive seasons of scant rain results in crop failure, poor livestock production, and acute food insecurity.

Among the estimated 2.7 million Somalis affected he says are 840,000 children under age five.","reports, millions, poor, somalis, water, pasture, hunger, face, widens, laerke, somalia, drought, acute, million, worst, shortages",drought,Acute climatological event (droughts),"The U.N. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, OCHA, reports an estimated 2.7 million Somalis will face severe food shortages over the coming months as drought conditions affect more areas in the country.

Somalia’s decade-long drought continues to chip away at people’s ability to cope with this seemingly never-ending disaster. The worst has not yet come to pass. The U.N. reports pre-drought conditions already can be seen in parts of Somaliland, Puntland, Hirshabelle, Galmudug and Jubaland states.

OCHA spokesman, Jens Laerke, says people in these areas, who have barely recovered from last year’s poor seasonal rains, are facing a similarly grim situation this year.

“Tens of thousands of people in Somalia have been forced to leave their homes since November because of extreme water shortages, and forecasts now indicate that the current rainy season, which runs from March to June, will only deliver below average rainfall,” said Laerke.

Relief agencies report two consecutive seasons of scant rain results in crop failure, poor livestock production, and acute food insecurity. Laerke says the hunger crisis in Somalia will be at its worst between April and June. Among the estimated 2.7 million Somalis affected he says are 840,000 children under age five.

“That is an increase of more than 65 percent compared to current levels,"" said Laerke. ""Water shortages will also increase the risk of disease outbreaks… The loss of rain-fed pasture is threatening the survival of livestock which is the foundation of many Somalis’ livelihoods. Displaced people have told OCHA that they are moving in search of water and pasture for their animals.”

The United Nations has appealed for $1 billion to provide life-saving assistance this year to four million people in Somalia affected by conflict, climate change and COVID-19. Laerke says only 2.5 percent of that funding has been received, a sum well below that needed to help Somalia cope with this emergency."
