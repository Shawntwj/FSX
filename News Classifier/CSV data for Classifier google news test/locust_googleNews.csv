Aid agencies report swarms of locusts have been descending on farms in northern Kenya, destroying crops and even leaving pastures bare of vegetation.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in a regional update on the pests says swarms have been detected this week in seven counties in Kenya compared to just four a week ago.

Across the Horn of Africa locust invasions have reached dangerous levels in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, according to the FAO.

""For Kenya this is a second wave,"" Hamisi Williams FAO deputy country representative for Kenya told Spice FM in Nairobi. ""The first wave came in 2020 and we dealt with it."" Kenya attacked the locusts with insecticides both from individual farmers on the ground and aerial spraying from planes. But other countries in the region ‚Äî ones with fewer resources and wracked by conflict including Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia ‚Äî didn't go after the bugs as aggressively.

""A lot of (locust) breeding happened in Ethiopia for the entire 2020. The same situation happened in Somalia,"" Williams said. ""We are now suffering the fate of our neighbors who just didn't do a good job for one reason or the other,"" in controlling the desert-dwelling grasshoppers.

But he concedes that part of the reason the locusts reproduced so rapidly was because of unusual rainfall patterns.

""We saw very intense rainfall in areas of northeastern (Kenya), where normally it's very dry,"" Williams said. ""Normally there would be nothing there for locusts to feed on. They wouldn't be able to survive there for long."" But that wasn't the case last year. ""And you got so much fodder which the locusts were able to feed on, and they were able to breed.""

The Famine Early Warning System says that several parts of the Horn of Africa currently are facing food crises driven in part by the surge in swarms of desert locusts. The warning system originally created by the U.S. Agency for International Development predicts the lack of adequate food will get even worse in the coming months. The areas expected to deteriorate the most are Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen.

Keith Cressman, the senior locust forecasting officer at the FAO based in Rome calls the desert locusts which are currently plaguing the region ""professional survivalists."" He says these insects ""are living in some of the harshest parts of the world. They're living in the Sahara desert, in the deserts of Arabia and southwest Asia. And when the rains do fall they have this capacity to take advantage of those exceptional occasions and reproduce very, very rapidly.""

Over a three month period a swarm of locusts can multiply 20 fold, Cressman says.

""The other thing is that they have this great capacity to migrate. So they don't get stuck in areas when conditions dry out. They just simply pick up and move to greener pastures,"" he says. They fly with the wind and can travel more than 100 miles in a day.

""They can easily cross the Red Sea so they can go from Sudan to Saudi Arabia in a day, for example,"" Cressman says of the biblical pests. ""They can easily cross from northern Somalia directly across the Indian Ocean to India and Pakistan.""

And when they arrive somewhere, they're incredibly destructive, ravenously devouring vegetation.

""Imagine a swarm the size of Manhattan in New York, which is not a very big swarm,"" he says. ""That single swarm in one day will eat the same amount of food as everybody in New York and California.""

For local farmers, the arrival of a cloud of locusts can spell doom. Since last year, FAO has helped to set up a fleet of 28 aircraft in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The planes both spot for swarms and carry out aerial spraying against them.

""We're not trying to exterminate the locusts, or eliminate them completely,"" Cressman says. ""We are just trying to bring them down to lower levels. Then natural predation, natural diseases, will manage the locusts as they normally do in most years."" But adding to the current woes of the region, even the funding for those aircraft is in danger of drying up.

The FAO Deputy Director-General Laurent Thomas is asking for an additional $40 million dollars to support the operation. ""The last time Africa saw an upsurge of locusts approaching this scale, in the Sahel, it took two years and more than $500 million to bring under control,"" Thomas said Tuesday in a statement. ""This (current) upsurge was even bigger, but East Africa is poised to end it ‚Äî provided governments can keep those aircraft flying."""

No time for complacency

Dominique Burgeon, FAO‚Äôs Director of Emergencies and Resilience, said the huge desert locust swarms in 2020, some as wide as 60 kilometres, had not been seen in decades, threatening food security in a region where many were already going hungry.

Surveillance and response led to 1.6 million hectares of land being treated. As a result, more than three million tonnes of cereals, valued at approximately $940 million, were protected: enough to feed 21 million people for a year.

‚ÄúWe can say that huge progress has been made, capacities of the countries have been tremendously augmented‚Ä¶but yet the situation is not over‚Äù, he told journalists.

‚ÄúWe have made a huge effort, we are much better prepared, but we should not be complacent. We should not relax.‚Äù

Swarms arriving ‚Äònearly every day‚Äô

Keith Cressman, FAO‚Äôs Senior Locust Forecasting Officer, said Cyclone Gati in December brought heavy rains, creating the conditions for new swarms to form in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia.

Locusts began migrating south to northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia when the waters dried up, as experts had predicted.

‚ÄúWe had forecasted this in October. We had provided early warning to both countries to expect this shortly after mid-December, and that‚Äôs indeed what happened‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúAnd since then, they have been arriving nearly every day.‚Äù

The locusts are young now but will mature, and reproduce, in the coming months. FAO anticipates a new generation will emerge in early April, coinciding with seasonal rains and the planting period in Kenya and southern Ethiopia.

Desert locusts are also breeding further north, on Somalia‚Äôs coastline on the Gulf of Aden, with new swarms likely to begin forming in late February.

‚ÄúThis is a cause of concern, and this is also why it‚Äôs extremely important that the control operations‚Ä¶are not disrupted‚Äù, said Mr. Cressman."

News of the swarms has left people resorting to any measures they can to get rid of them.

One farmer in Marsabit in northern Kenya tried to chase a swarm of locusts from his land by banging a stick against a jerry can, causing clouds of insects to swarm around him as they briefly flew off from his crops.

‚ÄúHe was trying to chase them... we helped him, but it was too much,‚Äù Ilias Iman Abdulkadir, a senior project officer at Catholic Relief Services based in Marsabit, told Reuters.

Abdulkadir said the situation was similar in the rest of Marsabit.

‚ÄúThe first wave just passed around the town, but this one actually came within the town, almost everyone came to see, people were very much scared,‚Äù he said.

The swarms are not limited to Kenya. Immature hoppers have also hatched in Ethiopia and Somalia.

""I am very desperate,"" he told DW. ""I was expecting a harvest to feed my family and take the children to school. Look at how my crops have been destroyed. Everything is gone now.""

The culprits are one of the world's oldest pests and probably have their most famous reference in the Old Testament's Book of Exodus: Locusts. In 2020, a plague of the hoppers invaded East Africa, ravaging crops and pastures and driving the level of human hunger and economic hardship higher in parts of the region. One year later, right at the start of 2021, the United Nations has warned that a second and maybe even deadlier re-invasion of locusts has already begun.

The locusts are breeding and multiplying at an alarming rate

Trillions of locusts in East Africa

The first wave of the pests emerged at the end of 2019, numbering in hundreds of billions, multiplying by a factor of 20 per generation, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The second generation in March and April numbered in the trillions. A plague that spread like wildfire ‚Äî up to now.

""It's a continuation of the 2020 locusts swarm. The adults have flown to various areas and are laying eggs"", Frances Duncan, Professor of Animal, Plant & Environmental Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, told DW. ""If we have good rains like it is the case at the moment in most areas, the hoppers will hatch, and we get the second wave of the swarm.""

However, Keith Cressman, FAO's Senior Locust Forecasting Officer, remains optimistic. ""I think it's still a very dangerous situation. But it should not be worse as it was last year."" According to the weather forecast, the months to come should be dry, reducing the locusts' reproductive rate.

Threatening food security

Kenya was heavily affected by the worst invasion of locusts in 70 years. In Garissa, the insects have driven farmers into despair: Their farms' total yields in 2020 were destroyed in less than 24 hours.

Nur Fadhil remembers that they had no chance against the plague. ""We have tried chasing the locusts away, but our efforts were in vain. The locusts spent the night on our farms. When we woke up the next day, they were still here. They had munched on everything on the farm. We have gone through massive losses,"" Fadhil said.

In an emergency case, the FAO is ready to step in, Cressman told DW in an interview. ""We are constantly monitoring the locusts' situation, the weather conditions, and provide service to all countries in the world in terms of early warning and forecasting so they can be prepared to respond."" The FAO is supporting control operations financially through pesticides, aircraft, and sprayers.

Cressman emphasized that the livelihoods of the population need to be protected. ""If a farmer has crops planted and his crop has been wiped out, and he does not have resources to buy new seeds to replant, the FAO can assist. For pastoralists, if there is not enough food for animals, the FAO can provide animal feed.""

Breeding in Ethiopia and Somalia

Five countries have been especially hard hit by the African migratory locusts: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. As a result, more than 35 million people suffer from food insecurity. FAO estimates this number could increase to 38.5 million if nothing is done to control the new infestation.

The FAO warns that numerous immature swarms have already formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, now they have reached northern Kenya. More swarms will arrive in January and spread throughout Ethiopia and Kenya.

""If the locust swarm is not controlled, it can completely destroy the crop and wipe out animal feed. This poses a serious threat to food security in the region and can lead to human and social crises,"" Amh Yeshewas Abay, Head of Natural Resources Office in South Omo Zone Hamer Woreda in Ethiopia, said in a DW interview. ""We are working to eradicate locusts in northern Kenya and on the border with Somalia.""

Danger of conflict

In northern Somalia, swarms laid eggs in areas affected by Cyclone Gati. Heavy rains in the region had turned out to favor the locusts, the UN says. New immature swarms could start to form in early February. Adult groups and a few swarms appeared on the coast of Sudan and Eritrea in December.

East Africa has seen the worst locust plague in decades

According to Daniel Lesego from Kenya's National Disaster Management Unit, the locust invasions come with multiple risks apart from food insecurity. ""If there will be competition over pasture, space, and water, then it is likely to trigger conflict, resource-based conflict, and that is something that we do not want to see in Kenya,"" he told DW. ""For us, this is a national call. It is a national duty that we are responding to and are committed to ensuring that locusts in Kenya are eradicated to make sure that locusts do not cross to our neighbors.""

Is East Africa prepared?

1.3 million hectares of locust invasion were treated across 10 countries since January last year to stave off an economic and agricultural catastrophe, according to the UN. Countries have prepared themselves to use pesticides on the ground and from the air. It helped to prevent the loss of around 2.7 million tons of cereal.

""Countries have been alerted to this possibility for a couple of months. They have been preparing, mobilizing their teams and getting them into the field to doing the monitoring, identifying locusts and doing ground control operations, supported by aerial operations,"" Cressman said, adding that the goal would now be to treat as many swarms as possible, ""before they spread, mature, and lay eggs for another generation of locusts.""

The Kenyan government has set aside $30 million (‚Ç¨24 million) to fight the second wave. Agriculture Minister Peter Munya told journalists that Kenya is well-equipped to fight the locust swarms and promised that in counties where crops and livestock have been lost, the government would intervene to help distribute seeds, cereals, clean water, or fertilizers.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Tiny but powerful Bark beetles, which reproduce in inner tree bark, have a killer reputation. And while some species of the bug do attack healthy trunks, they generally go for trees that are already diseased, dying or weak. Their role in forest ecology is a hotly contested issue, with some saying they provide an invaluable service and others insisting they are havoc-wreaking pests.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Fake fall The horse chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) takes its name from the trees it discolors. First observed in northern Greece in the mid eighties, it has since spread to other parts of Europe. Its larvae mine the leaves causing them to turn brown and drop before autumn takes its toll on other tree species. But the damage is not lasting. Come spring, they burst back into green life.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Danger in numbers The damage caused by plagues of locusts is well documented. Desert locusts in particular can swarm into groups of between 40 and 80 million creatures, devastating crops intended for human consumption. Capable of eating their own weight each day, a swarm as large as the one mentioned above, could devour more than 190 million kilos of plants on a daily basis.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers The holy snail trail With their long eyes and neat architectural design, a lot of people find snails cute and endearing. Not so farmers. These slimy little - and sometimes big - creatures are big eaters and will happily chomp their way through crops, such as lettuces, cabbage and broccoli leaving a trail of holes in their wake. Or in the case of smaller plants, tearing them to shreds.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Short, but busy lives Like so many pests, pea aphids take their name from their victim of choice. Which in this case means peas, though they also have a predeliction for clover and alfalfa. A mere 4 mm in length and only of this world for some 12 days, they suck the juice from their ""host"" plants, and are capable of killing them in the process. Oh and BTW: females can produce as many as 100 nymphs in their short lives.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Terrible termites Termites are more or less synomymous with mounds of earth and unsafe wooden constructions, but they also have a weakness for some plants - most notably maize. They hollow out the roots and base of the plant, first causing it to wilt, but in some cases later, to die. They also affect both tea and coffee plants, African palm oil, rubber and sugarcane. A varied appetite with a destructive outcome.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Bad for bees Varroa mites are bad news for honey bees and can wipe out entire colonies. As parasites, they attach themselves to the bee's body and then suck out their host's bodily fluid, thereby weakening their immune systems and rendering them vulnerable to disease. The impact is not only bad for the bees themselves, but for crop pollination.

‚Ä¢ The Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG) recently conducted a regional Desert Locust impact assessment in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia using a harmonized approach. The assessment interviewed 7,871 agricultural respondents across Desert Locust-affected areas of the region between October and early December 2020.

‚Ä¢ The assessment found that roughly one third of cropping households and a half of livestockrearing households experienced Desert Locust-related pasture and crop losses.

‚Ä¢ For impacted households, Desert Locust losses were often quite large. More specifically, nearly 7 out of every 10 impacted cropping and livestock-rearing respondents experienced high or very high losses to their crops and rangeland.

‚Ä¢ Considering only areas included in both Round 1 (conducted in June/July) and Round 2 (conducted in October/November/December), a comparison of the two round‚Äôs data shows significant declines in the percentage of respondents observing Desert Locusts and related losses in Kenya, relative stability or slight declines in Ethiopia, and mixed results in Somalia.

‚Ä¢ Beyond direct crop and rangeland impacts, Desert Locust affected respondents also commonly expressed concerns that Desert Locusts were driving increased food insecurity/malnutrition, emotional stress/anxiety, issues relating to animal and human health, environmental impacts, and high costs of control.

‚Ä¢ Due to multiple, compounding hazards (e.g. Desert Locusts, below-average rains, etc.), there was general pessimism amongst respondents (both those affected by Desert Locusts and those who were not) about harvest prospects and current rangeland conditions. In the areas where the highest percentage of respondents reported poor pasture availability or that harvests would be below average, Desert Locusts were identified as a key driver of current conditions.

‚Ä¢ Food insecurity amongst the interviewed agricultural respondents was found to be high with more than 20 percent of respondents in most of the assessed areas reported a reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI) exceeding 18, the threshold for Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse. The highest prevalences of food insecurity were observed in ten administrative areas in Ethiopia (Nogob, Jarar, Shabelle, Korahe, Borena, West Harerge, Doolo, Siti, Fafan, and South Omo). Additionally, major deteriorations in food insecurity amongst agricultural households were found between Round 1 (conducted in June/July) and Round 2 (conducted in October/November/December) in Awdal, Galgaduud, and Woqooyi Galbeed in Somalia and in Guji, Hareri, Korahe, Siti, and South Omo in Ethiopia. Given already high levels of food insecurity, current challenges to crop and livestock production threaten to drive further food security deteriorations."

However, XAG's agricultural drones with night-operation mode are able to join the locust ""air force"" under certain circumstances.
Fitted with four rotary atomisers, XAG's agricultural drones can operate fully autonomous on a predetermined path and deliver uniform sprays three metres above the targeted locust swarms.
The first step is to survey and map the fields before sunset in which locust swarms are identified.
""During daytime, the locust swarms spread out over an extremely large area and stay mobile in the air for long periods.","locust, swarms, xags, zambia, africa, outsmart, spraying, agriculture, agricultural, drones, night, suggests, locusts, xag",locust,idiosyncratic,"The unusually rapid spreading of locusts in Africa is largely the result of erratic weather associated with climate change. Prolonged rains lead to moist, humid desert lands and flourishing vegetation, which creates a conducive environment for locust swarms to breed freely.

According to the FAO Desert Locust situation updated on 22 January, the Greater Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, is the most-affected region witnessing the arrival of more immature swarms. The estimated above-the-average rainfalls brought by Cyclone Gati cause the swarms to complete maturation and lay eggs. This will give rise to multiple generations to be born during February and March, again putting food security and the livelihoods of rural households in danger since the last upsurge turned calm in July 2020.

Finding versatile, easy-to-use new tools to tackle these notorious locusts becomes more urgent when local farmers and response teams have been struggling to contain them. In times of this crisis, drones provide an innovative complementary solution to the more expensive manned aircraft or the less effective manual spraying method. They can be used to conduct ultra-low-volume (ULV) precision spraying of chemical or biological pesticides to kill the locusts, especially in the impacted areas otherwise inaccessible for ground vehicles and aeroplanes.

When the locust swarms are unscrupulously flying and densely-packed during day, it is suggested unsafe and ineffective for drones to carry out spraying operations. However, XAG's agricultural drones with night-operation mode are able to join the locust ""air force"" under certain circumstances. They can either target the wingless nymphs and hopper bands at the early stage, or launch an attack when the flying adults settle down after sunset.

The use of unmanned devices is also expected to help lessen the strain on supplies and human resources that are needed to suppress the locust outbreaks in the poverty-stricken regions of Africa. Fitted with four rotary atomisers, XAG's agricultural drones can operate fully autonomous on a predetermined path and deliver uniform sprays three metres above the targeted locust swarms. This means that less sophisticated skills of the field operators are required, while reducing the quantities of pesticides used to minimum level. Such unmanned technology therefore shows strengths to fight a locust invasion amid travelling restrictions and social distancing imposed due to COVID-19.

The Night Guard to Protect Livelihoods

In a recent demonstration of drone spraying, Sunagri Investment Zambia Limited, as XAG's global partner in Africa, has put forward the new ideas of night-time locust control to the Ministry of Agriculture and Zambia Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). It is now on track to get its XAG gear ready for possible locust outbreak during the upcoming dry season. Sunagri offers precision crop-spraying service with XAG's agricultural drones in Zambia, Uganda and Tanzania, helping farmers sustainably treat pest diseases and reap the benefits of improved yields. In 2019, XAG has worked with Sunagri to provide drone interventions that yielded success to manage the crop-devouring fall armyworm.

Fraser Zhang, the owner of Sunagri Zambia, explained the solution on how to apply drones more effectively to support the locust control operations. The first step is to survey and map the fields before sunset in which locust swarms are identified. Then drones can be deployed at night to concentrate their spraying forces against swarms which become inactive and rest on trees or on the ground after sunset.

""During daytime, the locust swarms spread out over an extremely large area and stay mobile in the air for long periods. Their dynamic movement makes them much more difficult to be contained. But at night, what we would aim for are static objects which can be accurately sprayed,"" said Zhang.

The Desert locusts are one of the species of short-horned grasshoppers, which have been considered the world's most destructive migratory pest. They usually form into a swarm whose density can reach up to a whopping 80 million per square kilometre, eating massive amounts of crops and vegetations and leaving people inflicted with food losses. The locusts can reproduce exponentially, and if left unchecked, a group of its population would multiply 20-fold in only three months and grow 400 times in half a year.

According to the United Nation, since January 2020, the hungry desert locusts have swept across dozens of countries in Africa and Southwest Asia, some of which reported the worst locust upsurge in decades. The Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen are the epicentre of crisis, with over 48 million people facing acute food insecurity.

Zambia also experienced a similar infestation on 300,000 hectares of land in 2020, but by a different species called African Migratory Locusts (AML). ""The Western Province of Zambia is worst-hit by the locusts. It is anticipated that the mature swarms have already laid eggs at this point, which will hatch and lead to a new wave of invasions in coming months,"" said Fraser Zhang.

With more extreme weather events making frequent occurrences, the locust crisis is not likely to fade away very soon. We should be racing to test new tools and technologies such as agricultural drones which would help better respond to any outbreaks now and in the future.

Nairobi/New York/Rome, 19 January 2021 - A locust fighting force assembled by countries in East Africa to combat an invasion of the crop-devouring pest is at risk of seeing its activities grind to a halt as funding to sustain its operations dries up, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warned today.

Without additional financing for fuel, airtime, and pilot hours, the 28 anti-locust aircraft which are now patrolling the skies to spot and spray locust swarms could cease operations in March, the Organization told partners at a virtual briefing event today.

""The locust fighting machine that has been assembled in East Africa is now fully equipped and able to contain, suppress and we believe, eventually end this record-breaking upsurge,"" said FAO Deputy Director-General Laurent Thomas.

""Governments have built up capacity in record-time. Swarms have been massively reduced in number and in size. It would be tragic to throw these achievements away just as the nations of East Africa are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Thomas said, adding: ""There is a real possibility they could bring this upsurge to an end this year, but they need to be able to continue doing what they are doing, without faltering.""

Some $33.8 million in additional funding will be needed to allow that to happen through June, FAO informed humanitarian partners at today's briefing, urging them to help East Africa and Yemen get through the last mile of their desert locust marathon.

A quantum leap in readiness

When the first wave of locusts first exploded across East Africa in early January 2020, fuelled by heavy rains dumped by an abnormally late season cyclone, many countries had little or no capacity to monitor movements of the pest or mount control activities at scale. Indeed, most had not seen a locust incursion of such magnitude in over 50 years.

Now, one year on, with FAO support they have succeeded in fielding a locust fighting force in the air and on the ground that involves 28 airplanes and helicopters, 260 ground units, and some 3,000 newly trained spotters and control operators.

Over 6,000 hours of air sorties have been flown to spot and spray infestations of the pest. New innovations such as the eLocust3 digital tools, satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, and trajectory models have been harnessed to report locusts in real-time and deliver maps of infestations, breeding areas, and migration routes.

More than 1.5 million hectares of land have been treated in East Africa and Yemen since the start of the campaign in January 2020.

FAO estimates these efforts helped avoid crop and dairy losses worth an estimated at $1.2 billion, safeguarding the livelihoods of 28 million people.

2021 is not 2020 all over again

While the locusts remain a threat, East Africa is starting off 2021 on a much better footing.

The upsurge that started last January has been sustained by consistently favourable weather conditions ever since, causing a cascade of reproduction that saw an unusually large population of the pest disperse and persist across the region, notwithstanding the successful large-scale control operations that were scaled up to meet the threat.

And in recent months, heavy rains and another late-season cyclone sparked a new round of breeding, causing more swarms to form. As a result, Kenya and southern Ethiopia are currently being re-invaded, after having beat back the first incursion last year. Even the United Republic of Tanzania recently witnessed a swarm in the northeast.

But despite this renewed activity, the situation today is not at all the same as it was 12 months ago, thanks to generous donor support, according to FAO.

For one, the countries of the region are now prepared, equipped, and ready.

Secondly, the numbers of Desert Locusts are much reduced, with fewer swarms of decreased density and size.

For instance, one mega-swarm detected last year in Kenya covered 240 000 hectares of land, an area the size of Luxembourg. Today, however, control teams are treating smaller swarms of 100-1 000 hectares or so at a time.

""The last time Africa saw an upsurge of locusts approaching this scale, in the Sahel, it took two years and more than $500 million to bring under control. This upsurge was even bigger, but East Africa is poised to end it -- provided governments can keep those aircraft flying,"" said FAO's Thomas.

Several immature swarms arrived on the Red Sea coast and Asir Mountains in southwest Saudi Arabia during the past week. These swarms are likely to have originated from adjacent coastal and highland areas in northern Yemen that cannot be accessed safely. Substantial control operations are in progress against early and mid-instar hopper groups and bands on the Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia from Jizan to Al Wajh. In Yemen, scattered adults are present on the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts that have not required control so far.

In the Horn of Africa, immature swarms continue to arrive and disperse throughout northern and central Kenya. In the past two days, swarms have been reported in 10 counties (Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Marsabit, Samburu, Laikipia, Meru North, Meru Central, and Tharaka). So far, only a few swarms have started to mature. In the southeast, fledging occurred near Taita Taveta and a few late instar hopper bands were present along the coast.

In Ethiopia, immature swarms have moved into Afar and eastern Amhara regions while other immature swarms continue to be present and are spreading out in parts of Oromia and SNPP regions. Immature swarms persist south of Jijiga and a few remain in parts of the eastern Somali region where it is drying out. There is a risk that a few swarms could continue to move from Afar into Amhara and Tigray and perhaps reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and Saudi Arabia. Swarms will mature shortly and start laying eggs mainly in Oromia and SNNP.

In Somalia, hopper groups and bands are present on the northwest coast and in the northeast where laying is still ongoing. Some swarms have remained in central areas (Mudug, Galgaduud) where they are mature and may breed in any favourable places. Immature swarms are present in the south where they continue to move to Kenya.

As conditions remain dry in some parts of southern and northern Ethiopia and north-central Kenya, the swarms are likely to spread out looking for favourable areas to mature and lay eggs if rains fall in the coming weeks. This would give rise to hopper bands during February and March. Intense aerial and ground control operations are in progress to reduce the current swarms so that the scale of the upcoming breeding may be lower.

Breeding continues along the Red Sea coastal plains on both sides of the Eritrea/**Sudan** border where control teams are treating hopper groups and bands. Similar breeding is in progress in Wadi Diib in northeast Sudan."

GOAL Ethiopia is responding to a new desert locust infestation which is threatening agricultural livelihoods and food security for thousands across the country. The latest threat comes a year after locust swarms affected millions of people across East Africa.

Last year‚Äôs outbreak was the worst recorded in Kenya for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of insects also swarmed into neighbouring nations, such as Somalia and Ethiopia. A new locust outbreak could now compound an already bleak food security situation in Ethiopia. 8.6 million people currently face high levels of food insecurity, due to Covid-19, displacement and high food prices.

Collective action needed to fight new outbreak

Early last year, swarms of desert locusts started to spread across countries in the Horn of Africa, devastating crops and people‚Äôs livelihoods. To avoid a humanitarian crisis, the UN called for collective action. Up to $194 million was raised to fight the outbreak last year. One year on, the agency has said that $80 million could now be needed to control the scourge in the coming months.

The UN has warned that immature swarms in the Horn of Africa have been migrating southwards from breeding areas in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia to southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. In Ethiopia, the swarms are concentrating along the eastern side of the Harar Highlands in Oromia region as they move to southern areas of the country.

Many regions are already suffering with other food insecurity threats

12 local administrative areas in the Teltelle district of the Oromia Region of Ethiopia are now seriously affected. Dinkneh Asfaw, GOAL Ethiopia‚Äôs Country Director, says that communities in the Teltelle district are struggling to cope with the new infestation.

‚Äò‚ÄòThis community has not had time to recover from the last year‚Äôs outbreak. They are even more vulnerable to this new risk. The infestation is now impacting 3,211 households and a total area of 3,275 hectares of crop land and almost 8,000 hectares of grazing lands. The food security situation could be even more serious, as erratic rain in the area is expected to decrease much of the crop yield that was cultivated during 2020,‚Äô‚Äô he added.

The new locust outbreak has also impacted the districts of Dillo and Dhas, with thousands of hectares being affected in both regions. Last year, thanks to support from ECHO and Irish Aid, GOAL supported local authorities with infestation control measures, helping over 9,000 families protect their farms from the insects and through distribution of cash assistance of multiple rounds in Teltele and Elwaye districts in Borena zone. GOAL teams are currently identifying the needs of local communities before offering financial assistance and seed support.

Early control measures critical

Desert Locusts are considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world, devouring large areas of crops and grasses meant for people and livestock. According to the UN‚Äôs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a swarm of 40-80 million locusts can consume the amount of food equivalent to that eaten by 35,000 people in a day.

Strengthening early detection and control measures are critical in the fight against locust infestations. And a vital tool for farmers in the wider battle against food insecurity. GOAL teams are on the ground helping local farmers to cope with the locust threat and ensure communities have access to food supplies. You can support this work with a donation today."

In the Horn of Africa, immature swarms continue to migrate southwards from breeding areas in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia to southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. There were reports that a few immature swarms reached Mwanga district in northeast Tanzania on 8 January 2021.

In Ethiopia, immature swarms are concentrating along the eastern side of the Harar Highlands in Oromia region as they move to southern areas of the country, including southern parts of the Rift Valley in SNNP region. There are also cross-border movements near Jijiga and northwest Somalia and along the southern border with Kenya.

In Kenya, immature swarms continue to arrive and spread throughout the north. So far, swarms are present in four counties (Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit and, most recently, Isiolo). Breeding continues, and hopper bands are present in the southeast near Taita Taveta and along the coast.

In Somalia, mature swarms are present in the northwest and breeding is in progress on the coast where hopper bands have formed. Breeding also continues in the northeast where numerous hopper bands are concentrated between Iskushuban and Bosaso. Breeding may also be underway in other areas on the northern plateau that received heavy rains from cyclone Gati. Immature swarms continue to move southwards in central and southern regions towards Kenya.

Control operations continue in all affected countries.

As conditions are dry in some areas where the swarms are arriving, they are expected to disperse throughout southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. There is a moderate risk that a few swarms could reach central Kenya and perhaps the southwest as well as northeast Tanzania, eastern Uganda, and southeast South Sudan during January. Once swarms arrive in favourable areas, they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and cause hopper bands to form during February and March.

Elsewhere, breeding is underway along both sides of the Red Sea coast. Hopper groups and bands are present along both sides of the Sudan/**Eritrea** border. Scattered solitarious adults prevail along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coastal plains in Yemen, and one mature swarm appeared in the northern highlands from the coast.

All countries should maintain maximum efforts in conducting the necessary survey and control operations to reduce migration and breeding."

Across the border, in north-western New South Wales biosecurity officers were urging farmers to monitor the presence of locusts.

Landholders have been asked to report any activity to Local Land Services (LLS) to help stop the destructive insects from spreading.

Coming weeks crucial for locust control

David Lindsay, a senior LLS biosecurity officer, based at Warialda, said he had seen banding locusts building in areas such as Mungindi, North Star, Yetman, Boggabilla, Croppa Creek and Moree.

He said the next few weeks would be critical for spraying to gain control of the pest.

""We are still in the timeframe at the moment, but it is starting to get towards the end of that,"" he said.

""The next week will be a crucial time.

""[Locusts] will start to disperse, and once that occurs, it gets a little bit too late. Once they start flying around it, is just impossible to spray them.""

Mr Lindsay said it was critical landholders reported locusts and monitored populations to get them under control before they caused widespread damage to summer crops and early winter crops.

""If we do that, we will stop them from fledging and going through the next cycle and laying more eggs,"" he said.

Mice continue to be a problem

Mr Kelly said large populations of mice had been active in the region for months, with numerous baiting programs carried out by farmers.

""That's another headache we have had, especially some sorghum that has been planted into double-crop country.

""Mice were obviously active in the winter crop, and when the fresh seeds of sorghum went into the ground they busily went in there and ate it, so we've had to bait some of them as well,"" he said."

According to the FAO report covering January‚ÄìJuly 2020, a very small locust swarm is capable of eating the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people. ‚ÄúA typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day,‚Äù the report said.

‚ÄúThe swarms could continue to central Kenya and perhaps a few swarms could reach the equatorial region in the southeast corner of South Sudan as well [as] in eastern Uganda,‚Äù says Keith Cressman, a senior forecasting officer at the FAO.

‚ÄúWe had to escape to the neighbouring Laigkipia County with our animals to save our lives.‚Äù Stephen Lekipasharan, Isiolo County, Kenya

The current swarms are likely to concentrate in areas with natural vegetation in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, but they could spread further into the East African region, already reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a World Health Organization report last week (19 January), Ethiopia ranked eighth in the WHO African region for new COVID-19 cases, with 2,980 recorded in the previous week.

An FAO report released yesterday warns that if it rains in the coming weeks, the swarms could spread as they look for conditions that would help them to mature and lay eggs.



Cressman explains that in the Middle East, breeding is underway along both sides of the Red Sea, mainly on the coast of Saudi Arabia where a mass of hoppers moving as a unit are present along a 1,000 kilometre stretch.

He says that control measures have included aerial and ground spraying using bio-pesticides, adding that there are two dozen aircraft undertaking aerial survey and control operations in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya.

Ôªø

‚ÄúSo far, more than 1.5 million hectares have been treated in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen. This has saved some 2.7 metric tonnes of crop production, which is equivalent to US$800 million and would feed 18 million people for one year,‚Äù Cressman says.

‚ÄúMore than 1.2 million households including more than 20 million people have been reached to safeguard livelihoods in the region in an intervention estimated to cost US$1 billion.‚Äù

Stephen Lekipasharan, a pastoralist from Kenya‚Äôs semi-arid Isiolo County, says that locust attack in 2020 nearly wiped out his livestock, and drove him from the only place he calls home.

‚ÄúThey devoured every green vegetation in their path, rendering the land desolate,‚Äù Lekipasharan tells SciDev.Net. ‚ÄúWe had to escape to the neighbouring Laikipia County with our animals to save our lives.‚Äù

Cressman says that smarter and more sustainable control approaches are needed in the face of an imminent large-scale locust resurgence and as funding starts to dry up amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A potential solution could be an artificial intelligence-powered tool known as Kuzi that uses satellite data, soil sensor data, ground meteorological observation, and machine learning to predict the breeding, occurrence and migration routes of desert locust, according to John Oroko, one of the brains behind Kuzi app and the CEO of Selina Wamucii, the Kenya-based company that developed it.

The device uses a machine-learning model trained to obtain satellite data of soil moisture, wind, humidity, surface temperature, as well as soil sensor data and vegetation index ‚Äîall factors that affect the breeding, swarm formation, and movement of locusts.

Local communities can also receive mobile phone text messages as alerts when locusts are likely to attack farms in their areas, including forage for livestock so that they can prepare well in advance, Oroko adds.

Ambrose Ngetich, locust control field officer in Isiolo, Kenya, says that efforts to control locusts need to be stepped up to avert conflicts.

‚ÄúIn a pastoral region like Isiolo, locust invasion is not just an economic issue, it is also a security issue because loss of pasture due to the locust can lead to serious conflict over resources,‚Äù Ngetich says.

Unusual weather patterns exacerbated by climate change have created ideal conditions for surging locust numbers, which have destroyed crops and grazing grounds across East Africa and the Horn.

Scientists say warmer seas are creating more rain, waking dormant eggs, and cyclones that disperse the swarms are getting stronger and more frequent.

The Bug Picture is working with communities around the area of Laikipia, Isiolo and Samburu in central Kenya to harvest the insects and mill them, turning them into protein-rich animal feed and organic fertilizer for farms.

‚ÄúWe are trying to create hope in a hopeless situation, and help these communities alter their perspective to see these insects as a seasonal crop that can be harvested and sold for money,‚Äù said Laura Stanford, founder of The Bug Picture.

In central Kenya‚Äôs Laikipia, clouds of locusts are devouring crops and other vegetation. The Bug Picture is targeting swarms of 5 hectares or less in inhabited areas not suitable for spraying.

Swarms can travel up to 150 km (93 miles) a day and can contain between 40-80 million locusts per square kilometre.

Between Feb. 1-18, the project oversaw the harvest of 1.3 tons of locusts, according to Stanford, who said she was inspired by a project in Pakistan, overseen by the state-run Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.

The locusts are collected at night by torchlight when they are resting on shrubs and trees.

As dawn breaks in central Kenya, a helicopter lifts off in a race to find roosting locusts before the sun warms their bodies and sends them on a ravenous flight through farmland.

Pilot Kieran Allen begins his painstaking survey from zebra-filled plains and lush maize farms, to dramatic forested valleys and the vast arid expanses further north, his eyes scouring the landscape for signs of the massed insects.

The chopper suddenly swings around after a call comes in from the locust war room on the ground: a community in the foothills of Mount Kenya has reported a swarm.

""I am seeing some pink in the trees,"" his voice crackles over the headphones, pointing to a roughly 30-hectare (75-acre) swathe of desert locusts.

Reddish-pink in their immature‚Äîand hungriest‚Äîphase, the insects smother the tips of a pine forest.

Allen determines that nearby farms are at a safe distance and calls in a second aircraft which arrives in minutes to spray the swarm with pesticide.

On the ground, having warmed to just the right temperature, the thick cloud of locusts fills the air with a rustling akin to light rainfall. But a few hours from now, many will be dead from the effect of the poison.

Last month alone, Allen logged almost 25,000 kilometres (15,500 miles) of flight‚Äîmore than half the circumference of the world‚Äîin his hunt for locusts after a fresh wave of insects invaded Kenya from Somalia and Ethiopia.

Like other pilots involved in the operation‚Äîwho have switched from their usual business of firefighting, tourism, or rescuing hikers in distress‚Äîhe has become an expert on locusts and the dangers they pose.

""Those wheat fields feed a lot of the country. It would be a disaster if they got in there,"" he says pointing to a vast farm in a particularly fertile area of Mount Kenya.

Second wave

Desert locusts are a part of the grasshopper family which form massive swarms when breeding is spurred by good rains.

They are notoriously difficult to control, for they move up to 150 kilometres (90 miles) daily. Each locust eats its weight in vegetation daily and multiplies twenty-fold every three months.

The locusts first infested the east and Horn of Africa in mid-2019, eventually invading nine countries as the region experienced one of its wettest rainy seasons in decades.

Some countries like Kenya had not seen the pest in up to 70 years and the initial response was hampered by poor co-ordination, lack of pesticides and aircraft, according to Cyril Ferrand, a Nairobi-based expert with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

A slick new operation to combat a second wave of the pests has improved control and co-operation in Kenya, Ethiopia and parts of Somalia.

Locust war room

In Kenya, the FAO has teamed up with the company 51 Degrees, which specialises in managing protected areas.

It has rejigged software developed for tracking poaching, injured wildlife and illegal logging and other conservation needs to instead trace and tackle locust swarms.

A hotline takes calls from village chiefs or some of the 3,000 trained scouts, and aircraft are dispatched.

Data on the size of the swarms and direction of travel are shared with the pilots as well as governments and organisations battling the invasion in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia.

""Our approach has completely been changed by good data, by timely data, and by accurate data,"" said 51 Degrees director Batian Craig.

He said in Kenya the operation had focused on a ""first line of defense"" in remote and sometimes hostile border areas, which had successfully broken up massive swarms coming in from Ethiopia and Somalia before they reach farmland further south.

Harvest peril: A desert locust tucks into maize, or corn, in a field in Meru. The species eats its own weight in food every day

In a complex relay, when the wind shifts and the swarms head back into Ethiopia, pilots waiting on the other side of the border take over the operation.

Southern and central Somalia is a no-go zone due to the presence of Al-Shabaab Islamists and the teams can only wait for the swarms to cross over.

Ferrand told AFP that in 2020 the infestation affected the food supply and livelihoods of some 2.5 million people, and was expected to impact 3.5 million in 2021.

He said while a forecast of below average rainfall and the improved control operation could help curb the infestation, it was difficult to say when it will end.

But with dizzying climate fluctuations in the region, ""we need to start looking ahead to what needs to be in place if we start to see more frequent infestations of desert locusts.""

While the size of swarms have decreased this year, each one is ""affecting someone's livelihood along the way,"" said Craig.

In a Meru village, desperate farmer Jane Gatumwa's 4.8-hectare farm of maize and beans is seething with ravenous locusts.

Air support: A plane sprays pesticides over locust-covered trees in Meru. The poison is not exclusive to pests, as bees, butterflies and other friendly insects are also killed. But it is designed to break down quickly and lose toxicity within a day

She and her family members run through the crops yelling and banging pieces of metal together in a futile bid to chase them away.

""They destroy everything, they have been here for like five days. I feel bad because these crops help us to get school fees and also provide food.""

""Now that there's nothing left we will have a big problem.""

How are locusts and climate change related?

Locusts are invertebrate insects around the size of a paperclip.

Plagues of the invertebrates have devastated societies since the Pharaohs led ancient Egypt, and they still wreak havoc today. But desert locusts are particularly threatening and affect the economic livelihood of a tenth of the planet‚Äôs population.

They are described as gregarious and are known to rapidly reproduce. What‚Äôs more, they can cover vast distances - some species may travel 130 kilometres or more a day, according to National Geographic.

A swarm the size of Paris can eat the same amount of food in one day as half the population of France.

Locust plagues and climate change are intrinsically linked because of the conditions they thrive in.

Working with communities in Kenya to harvest live locusts The Bug Picture

During dry spells, the animals are forced together in patchy areas of land where the remaining vegetation lies. This means they become more sociable and reproduce quicker.

Some experts worry that these plagues will worsen still in a warming world. It is estimated that the onset of locusts has been caused by rising sea temperatures and recent heavy rains and unusual storm activity in the East African region.

These impacts are linked to the ‚ÄòIndian Ocean Dipole‚Äô, a climate system in the Indian Ocean that affects weather from East Africa to Western Australia.

Preventing plagues in African countries particularly is difficult, due to the remoteness of the landscape. But scientists are looking at past weather patterns and historical records to identify areas where swarms might occur, and then spraying those areas with chemicals.

In Kenya, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties (Madera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Samburu, Isiolo, Meru, Tharaka, Tana River, Kilifi, Kitui, Machakos, Laikipia, Nakuru, Nyandarua) but as many swarms are highly mobile, the same swarm can easily be sighted several times. There have been no further reports of swarms in Turkana while a few small immature swarms formed from previous breeding along the coast near Lamu and probably in adjacent areas of southern Somalia. The number of swarms arriving from the north continued to decline. While rains have fallen in southern counties, more rain is needed in the north where the swarms are more likely to eventually mature and lay eggs. In order to reduce the next generation of breeding, ground and aerial control operations are focusing on the swarms before they can mature and lay.

A similar situation is underway in Ethiopia where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). As little rain has fallen in these areas, most of the swarms are expected to remain immature until more rainfall occurs to allow them to mature and lay eggs. Current ground and aerial control operations are working to reduce these swarms and the scale of the upcoming breeding.

In Somalia, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. A few residual hopper bands are likely to be on the northwest coast and one immature swarm was seen on the plateau south of Hargeisa, suggesting that new swarms are forming from the coastal breeding. As more swarms form in the north, most are expected to disperse along the northern plateau while some could move into adjacent areas of eastern Ethiopia or move south towards central and southern Somalia.

Mainly dry conditions are expected during the remainder of February in Somalia, northern Kenya, and southern Ethiopia.

In Yemen, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains.

In Saudi Arabia, immature adult groups from local breeding along the Red Sea coast moved through the Asir Mountains to the interior near Riyadh and Gassim. Breeding continues along the coast on both sides of the Sudan / Eritrea border. Control operations continue in all three countries.

The ""Agriculture Ministry of the Federal Republic of Somalia declares state of emergency over locust invasion in Somalia, particularly southern regions,"" state-run broadcaster Somali National Television (SNTV) said on its official Twitter account.

Somalia is currently facing humanitarian needs never witnessed before following a COVID-19 outbreak, floods and locusts.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) had warned that its entire fleet of anti-locust aircraft in Kenya and Somalia could be grounded due to a funding shortfall of $38 million.

The intensity of the East African desert locust outbreak has also been blamed on climate change with a focus on Cyclone Gati in the Indian Ocean, which made landfall on the Somali coast, the FAO said. In a statement, it warned that ""rains and winds are two of the most favorable conditions for desert locusts to multiply rapidly and spread to areas where they had been under control.‚Äù

Dominique Burgeon, the FAO's director of emergencies and resilience, told reporters that the huge desert locust swarms in 2020, some as wide as 60 kilometers (37 miles), had not been seen in decades, threatening food security in a region where many were already going hungry, and the 2021 swarms have been said to be deadlier, as Anadolu Agency (AA) reported.

The FAO said that more than half of the country's population ‚Äì 6.7 million people ‚Äì is currently experiencing severe food insecurity. This is up from 6.2 million in February last year. Of these, 3.2 million people face a severe food deficit.

Fifteen out of 47 counties in neighboring Kenya have been hit by a second, deadlier wave of locusts that came in through Ethiopia and Somalia. The Kenyan government announced that most of the new swarms came in through southern Somalia. Other East African countries including Uganda, South Sudan, Eritrea and Djibouti are also at risk. Millions of people in some of these places are already facing hunger in the wake of civil war or more common challenges such as poverty.

Just like in Somalia, the counties hit by the deadly swarms have arid and semi-arid lands where most people are nomadic pastoralists who rely on livestock for a living. Experts say that in Somalia, where about 50% of the people depend on animals for their livelihoods, the locusts are eating the pasturage. The animals weaken, their milk decreases and small children, who depend on the milk to survive, suffer skyrocketing malnutrition, the experts said, according to The Associated Press (AP).

Last year, young hungry locusts bulked up in Somalia, threatening 10 million people across the region with a severe hunger crisis. Large parts of Somalia south of this semi-autonomous Puntland region are under threat or held by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab terrorist group. That makes it difficult or impossible to conduct the aerial spraying of the locusts that experts say is the only effective control.

In December the U.N. said that locust infestations had increased in Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of extensive breeding, favorable weather and rainfall, with populations predicted to increase further in the coming months.

‚ÄúNew locust swarms are already forming and threatening to re-invade northern Kenya and breeding is also underway on both sides of the Red Sea, posing a new threat to Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen,‚Äù FQO said in a news release on Dec. 16.

It warned that the new crisis could have devastating consequences for communities affected by drought, ongoing conflict, rising food prices and the coronavirus pandemic.

""We have achieved much, but the battle against this relentless pest is not yet over,"" said the director-general of FAO, QU Dongyu. ""We must not waver. Locusts keep growing day and night and risks are exacerbating food insecurity for vulnerable families across the affected region."""

7 February 2021, Sana‚Äôa -The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries (MAIF) last week concluded a training workshop on Desert Locust surveillance and control in Aden. FAO also delivered three vehicles to MAIF under fund from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The five-days training workshop targeted 22 participants from local and central agriculture offices and aimed at enriching their knowledge and improve their skills in Desert Locust surveys, data collection and analysis, pest control tools, methods and mechanisms in addition to types of pesticides to be used for control operations and environmental and health standards including pesticides storage and handling and first aid in case of emergencies.

During the training workshop that is funded by the United Kingdom, FAO experts on Desert Locust carried out theoretical and practical sessions to ensure fully understanding and knowledge is reflected in field activities during surveillance and control activities.

In the closing ceremony, Hussein Gadain, FAO Representative in Yemen stressed the importance of joining efforts to face agricultural pests like desert locust which represents a real threat to national food security and livelihoods in Yemen and neighbouring countries. Gadain also appreciated the generous support given to FAO from partners like Belgium, Canada, United Kingdom, the World Bank and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as the efforts and support extended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to facilitate Desert Locust response in the country.

Handover ceremony of three vehicles for desert locust response in Yemen

During the training week, FAO handed over three vehicles to the Yemeni Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Fisheries that are funded by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)in an official ceremony attended by the Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation and the FAO Representative and senior government officials. This comes as part of FAO‚Äôs efforts to strengthen the technical and institutional capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture to face the pest in infested areas. These vehicles will contribute to scale up of surveillance and control activities by agriculture offices‚Äô field teams to curb Desert Locust outbreak in Yemen and enabling them to reach remote and hard to access areas.

During January 2021, FAO and Ministry of Agriculture efforts covered 207020 hectares throughout nine governorates: including Aden, Lahj, Abyan and Shabwah on the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea coasts and northern highlands of the country including: Hajjah, Amran, Hodeidah, Mahwait and Sana‚Äôa. Desert Locust upsurges and plagues can cause significant and widespread crop losses, which might affect national food security and agricultural livelihoods of the country which is already suffering from the ongoing conflict especially during the coming agricultural season crosscutting with the summer breeding areas.

Yemen has three seasonal breeding areas: (a) Winter breeding along the Red Sea including Hajjah and Hodeidah governorates and Gulf of Aden coastal plains including Abyan, Lahj, Shabwah, and parts of Albayda and Hadhramaut governorates from about November to March (b) Spring breeding in parts of the coastal area of Abyan and Shabwah governorates from about March to June and, (c) Summer breeding in the interior governorates of Aljawaf, Marib, Shabwah and Almaharah from about June to September."

In the past few days, light to moderate rains fell in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that could be sufficient to allow the swarms present in both countries to mature and eventually lay eggs, which would give rise to another generation of breeding. However, the scale of spring breeding is expected to be limited because of ongoing control operations that continue to reduce the number of swarms and the likelihood of poor spring rains starting next month.

In Ethiopia, immature swarms persist in Oromia (East Harerghe, Arsi, Borena) and SNNP (South Omo, Konso) regions, including southern areas of the Rift Valley where more swarms were reported.

In Kenya, small immature swarms are declining in northern and central counties. Many of the highly mobile swarms continue to be reported many times repeatedly, leading to multiple reports of the same swarm. There were no new reports of swarms arriving from Somalia. A few small swarms moved from southern Kenya to northeast Tanzania where they were reported near Mt. Kilimanjaro in Longido district of Arusha region and further south in Manyara region. One aircraft was deployed from Kenya and control operations are underway.

In Somalia, hopper bands and new immature swarms continue to form in the northeast (Puntland). Additional surveys are required in the northwest (Somaliland) where a similar situation is likely to be underway. The swarms that form in northern Somalia are likely to disperse along the northern plateau, drifting west towards Aysha district (Somali region) in eastern Ethiopia. A few swarms may move south towards Kenya.

The present situation in the Horn of Africa differs significantly from one year ago. The current swarms are smaller in size and less numerous. So far, the swarms have not matured or laid eggs. Very little rain has fallen since the end of the short rains last year. Intensive aerial control operations, supported by ground teams, are well-established and making good progress in reducing locust infestations.

A few adult groups and small swarms are forming on the Red Sea coastal plains in Sudan and Eritrea. In Yemen, low numbers of solitarious adults persist along the Red Sea coastal plains. In Saudi Arabia, hopper bands are present and groups of immature adults are forming on the northern Red Sea coast. An increasing number of mature adult groups and a few swarms are laying eggs in the interior between Riyadh and Hail where hatching is expected to start in early March. Although intensive control operations are in progress, a few groups have nearly reached the Persian Gulf and could reach Kuwait and the coastal plains in southwest Iran during periods of south-westerly winds.

The situation remains calm in the other regions."

Numerous immature swarms persist in southern Ethiopia and Kenya. There has been increased swarm movement in Oromia (East Harerge, Bale, Borema, Arsi) and SNNP (South Omo) regions of the south. The few swarms that moved to northern Ethiopia (Afar and Amhara) continued to Eritrea and reached the Red Sea coast where they were controlled. In Kenya, immature swarms continue to spread westwards across northern and central counties where there are currently about 20 small swarms present, mostly about 50 ha in size. Some of the swarms are in community areas and therefore cannot be treated. A small swarm reached Keiyo-Marakwet county in the west and another one was reported today in Turkana county in the northwest; hence, there is a risk that a few swarms could reach eastern Uganda and southeastern South Sudan.

It appears that the peak of the Kenya invasion has now passed as there have been no new reports of incoming swarms in the past two days and no further swarm reports in the east (Wajir, Garissa). Intensive control operations are underway in Kenya and southern Ethiopia to reduce the potential scale of the next generation of breeding. If rains fall in the next week or so, the swarms will quickly mature and lay eggs that will hatch and cause hopper bands to form; otherwise, this will be delayed until the arrival of the seasonal rains in March.

In Somalia, hopper bands are present on the northwest coast and in the northeast where some have started to fledge and will be forming immature swarms. Intensive control operations are underway to reduce the number of new swarms that will form this month. Swarms that form on the northwest coast are likely to move to the plateau and adjacent areas of eastern Ethiopia while swarms in the northeast are expected to spread west along the plateau where they could mature and give rise to another generation of breeding from about mid-March onwards, especially if more rains fall. A few swarms could migrate from the northeast towards southern Somalia where crop damage has been reported from previous swarms.

Control operations continue in winter breeding areas along the Red Sea, mainly against hopper groups and bands that formed along the coast of Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent against hopper bands on both sides of the Eritrea/Sudan border. Any infestations that escape control in Saudi Arabia could form adult groups and swarms that would most likely move inland to the spring breeding areas of the interior. In Yemen, scattered adults persist mainly along the Red Sea coast and to a lesser extent on the Gulf of Aden coast in the south. There remains a risk that a few swarms may be present in inaccessible areas of the north, which could move to adjacent areas of southwest Saudi Arabia.

The biggest problem we have with locust control at the moment is that outbreaks are so widespread in the remote Karoo areas that the delay in communication between farmers reporting locusts and the locust spray teams being able to find the locust targets allows some locust outbreaks to escape,‚Äù Price says.
Farmers were urged to report outbreaks as soon as possible to their local District Locust Officer or to the agriculture department‚Äôs locust depots at De Aar and Upington.","locusts, past, alert, outbreaks, brown, karoo, swarms, wide, price, locust, reported, high",locust,idiosyncratic,"New outbreaks of the brown locust Locustana pardalina have been reported over a wide area of the Central and Upper Karoo in January and February 2021 following good rain.

New outbreaks of the brown locust Locustana pardalina have been reported over a wide area of the Central and Upper Karoo in January and February 2021 following good rain.

The initial outbreaks started in late September 2020 in the eastern and south-eastern Karoo and produced large migrating adult swarms in late November 2020 that invaded the south-eastern Free State towards Bloemfontein and threatened to invade Lesotho before being tracked down and controlled.

At the time of writing, the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (agriculture department) confirmed that it was fighting new hopper outbreaks in Hopetown, Steynsburg, Britstown, Carnarvon, Vosburg, Loxton, Victoria West, Upington, Keimoes and Griekwastad.

Dr Roger Price, research team manager at the Agricultural Research Council, said brown locusts should not be confused with the desert locusts that have decimated crops in Eastern and Northern Africa and formed swarms of up to 400km¬≤ in size.

Brown locusts were endemic to the semi-arid Karoo areas of South Africa and southern Namibia, formed smaller swarms and did not produce the same devastating cycles as the desert locusts.

‚ÄúOver the past 40 years, brown locust plagues have occurred in 1985/1986, 1989/1990, 1994/1995, 2002/2001 and 2010/2011. The current outbreak is not yet intense enough to be classified as a plague, but it is the first major outbreak in the past 10 years,‚Äù Price says.

While no major damage had yet been reported from the current outbreaks, brown locusts could cause extensive damages to crops, with most damage caused to grazing veld, especially in areas with poorer-quality veld where the locusts were in direct competition with sheep for forage. Swarms escaping from the Karoo could also cause damage to maize and sorghum crops in the Free State and beyond.

Price said that an outbreak was to be expected sometime around now, due to the Karoo and various other parts of the country suffering consecutive droughts over the past few years, followed by good early summer rain in 2020.

‚ÄúThe droughts have led to a build-up of solitary locust populations and dormant locust egg deposits over a wide area, which have now hatched and multiplied thanks to the rainfall and resulting abundance of forage. The biggest problem we have with locust control at the moment is that outbreaks are so widespread in the remote Karoo areas that the delay in communication between farmers reporting locusts and the locust spray teams being able to find the locust targets allows some locust outbreaks to escape,‚Äù Price says.

Farmers were urged to report outbreaks as soon as possible to their local District Locust Officer or to the agriculture department‚Äôs locust depots at De Aar and Upington."

Last month, I also made history when I became the first Black Woman to win the Jacobson Global Venture Award and secure a $10K grant to scale ANIMA IRIS.

My Wharton classmate, Wilglory Tanjong, founded this luxury and sustainable handbag company one year ago. The company‚Äôs mission, which is to empower Black Women and redefine luxury through an eco-friendly manufacturing process, aligns completely with my values. Wilglory and I met in July. As our friendship blossomed, I began to share my insights on marketing and fundraising to support brand discovery for ANIMA IRIS. By November, I decided to join her executive team as she is scaling and growing the business.

Entrepreneurship comes in different forms and is rooted in solving a problem or broad concern. ANIMA IRIS celebrates and empowers Black Women, and the handbags are hand-made in Dakar, Senegal. Wilglory has been self-financing for the past 12 months. As the company expands, more capital is required to fund the growth phase. As a result, Wilglory and I have applied to several pitch competitions.

The Jacobson Global Venture, launched in 2016, is for students at the Lauder Institute who wish to pursue building their business idea in place of a traditional summer MBA internship. This was my first pitch competition and I competed against 13 teams. The competition was stiff, and each team had seven minutes to present, followed by an eight-minute question and answer portion with five judges.

This was an emotionally intense experience. ANIMA IRIS was the last company to pitch and I sat on zoom ALL DAY feeling insecure, watching the other teams‚Äô presentations. We even competed against last year‚Äôs winner and there are three winners annually to earn the Jacobson Global Venture Award. This experience taught me to get started with what I know, bet on myself and back it up with discipline. Additionally, my passion for entrepreneurship and ANIMA IRIS grew deeper as I created presentation materials to showcase WHY this company will be successful.

FAIL FORWARD

It is a myth that you need to ‚Äúhave everything together‚Äù before you start or support an enterprise. You will indeed make mistakes but persevere and learn from your missteps. Failing forward is putting your best effort into a new idea and maintaining a coachable learning posture. Think of feedback as a gift, so as you develop your business idea be resourceful and stay connected to an entrepreneurial ecosystem. This was true for Wilglory when she built her first handbag that was horrible. After much feedback and a Senegalese craftsman‚Äôs touch, she sold 500 handbags! This is also true for countless entrepreneurs who act on their ideas ‚Äì or someone like me, who entered a pitch competition without any experience presenting a company to investors.

When Wilglory asked me to lead ANIMA IRIS‚Äôs non-equity fundraising and marketing efforts, I accepted even though I had never worked in either function before. I remembered that the Lauder Institute has an annual competition for budding enterprises and my professor encouraged me to apply. I had one month to build a pitch deck, executive summary, and develop an award-winning seven-minute presentation.

I knew about new venture competitions at various business schools, so I researched templates and necessary components to include in the executive summary ‚Äì which summarizes the problem, solution, market size, competition, and executive team for your business. I actually enjoyed this writing phase to tell the story of ANIMA IRIS. I even reached out to the prior year‚Äôs winner for feedback on the summary and he was very helpful.

Next was the pitch deck ‚Äì I built four versions in two weeks. I have never built a pitch deck and I connected with three consultants before I decided to outsource the aesthetics of the presentation. Business school is a team sport, and your village of resources is a competitive advantage, so cultivate it wisely. My pitch deck was informative and vibrant but needed a professional touch. I reached out to CP and he did not disappoint. He rearranged the icons, centered my headers, restructured how I told the story of ANIMA IRIS, and kept me encouraged during this challenge.

CP tried to refuse my payment, but I positioned it as a ‚Äúgift card‚Äù to acquire an ANIMA IRIS bag for his leading lady. Subsequently, the pitch deck received numerous compliments, but the deck was not the star of the presentation ‚Äì Wilglory and I curated an awesome pitch to share with the judges. We crafted a pitch that told the story of a Black Woman Entrepreneur who works with a personal shopper to find her the perfect handbag that would represent her untold story. Wilglory and I had high energy as we presented, gave the judges something to feel inspired about, and were succinct with our core message about why our business is an exciting investment.

BET ON YOURSELF

I am passionate about business development in Africa and becoming a global leader is why I came to business school. Earning my MBA is my opportunity to pressure-test my strategic thinking and create innovative solutions with the worlds‚Äô emerging leaders. I struggled in these areas before I came to Wharton and I knew I would be stretching‚Äì this pitch competition is an elevated example. This ecosystem is an opportunity to step into the best version of yourself, in real life, as you learn from your MBA classmates and professors virtually. Even without formal experience, I believe in my potential and I have a growth mindset to become the best version of myself. Effectively, paying tuition is a formal ‚Äúbet‚Äù on the craps table. Once the dice rolls and ‚Äúclasses start‚Äù, the real risk is the hard work and hustle level within you to be ready WHEN the opportunity presents itself.

My opportunity came when I took ownership over non-equity fundraising and marketing for ANIMA IRIS. Wilglory never told me what to do, I gave her updates and accepted her feedback graciously to create the pitch deck and executive summary. I am fully committed to her vision, and she respects my ideas. However, she also pushes back with positive criticism when I make a false assumption. Wilglory was slow to adopt my ‚Äúpersonal shopper‚Äù presentation idea when I first shared it. I had to convince her that it was the right structure to tell ANIMA IRIS‚Äôs story. I have a sales background and I was confident that this approach would highlight our personalities and collective high energy. This is a competitive advantage when you are the last company to pitch out of 13 teams.

Managing an emerging enterprise is tough, but you have everything you need within your MBA community ‚Äì course content, students, faculty ‚Äì so leverage these assets to improve your decision-making. I remember pushing back on the advertising strategy after my marketing professor taught about ineffective mass marketing in class. Americus Reed advised that if a product is for ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù, then effectively, it is for no one. This is particularly true in the luxury retail industry. I outlined my approach to segment the market and together, Wilglory and I strategized a thoughtful solution to better engage our target audience. ANIMA IRIS Spring and Summer Collection launched on Feb 7th, and we should leverage a new customer segmentation model to grow sales.

BUSINESS MENTALITY

Respectfully speaking, business school teaches you to throw away the ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù mentality for competition. Instead, consider how the company executes on your target customer‚Äôs values or the risk profile to reduce your consumer‚Äôs concerns. This will help you develop the economic value of your product/service to the customer once you understand their expected utility. These are considerations that drive your price, social benefit, and long-term profitability. Within ANIMA IRIS, this is our competitive advantage. We center on Black Women through hand-made luxury handbags in ways that other luxury fashion brands fail.

ANIMA IRIS‚Äôs operation is centered around sustainability, quality materials, and progressive values that will disrupt a $313Bn global luxury fashion industry goods. The company is a solution to this concern since existing brands are slow-moving to cater to this demographic. Our pitch deck reflects this growing consumer segment, and our 31K followers on Instagram appreciate seeing Black Women showcase their agency in sustainable handbags that elevate their confidence. As I reflected on these values, the pitch deck, presentation, and all supporting components came together. Overall, this experience taught me to think as both a consumer and an investor, to ultimately pull it together and make history as the first Black Women to win the Jacobson Global Venture Award.

I also want to highlight two very important elements that can be helpful for any aspiring entrepreneurs or students looking to gain a competitive edge in a pitch competition. First, when you are building a business during your MBA experience, tell your professors. They have podcasts, business connections, and quality time for free consultations. Show them your data, problems, and be vulnerable when you need help. Professors are a guiding light as you elevate your business.

Secondly, leverage the virtual environment with recorded lectures. Should you come across a concern in your business and you vaguely remember a professor mentioning this topic ‚Äì go back and review a previous lecture, then request additional guidance, if necessary. This will breed academic mentorship with professors who enjoy seeing students connect with and go beyond the course content.

Finally, shoot your shot as you develop your business venture. Closed mouths do not get fed, so I am encouraging students to be bold. For example, tag the CEO of a company you want to partner with on your LinkedIn page. Within the business ecosystem, I implore you to think like a CEO, bet on yourself, and be nimble when you face adversity. Additionally, cultivate a village of support amongst classmates, professors, and business advocates that empower you on tough days and coach you during key moments.

I hope to see you ‚ÄúLiving on Locust‚Äù working on and pitching your business venture with soul, purpose, and a spirit of collaboration!

With wet, warm and sandy soil optimal for laying eggs, several generations of desert locusts have been bred since 2018.
Looking ahead, experts are urging fixes to systems designed to prepare for and respond to these locust outbreaks.
‚ÄúThere is not always long-term thinking around environmental protection with something like desert locusts,‚Äù says Monique Bennett, a senior researcher with Good Governance Africa.
If funding were available in time, any locust upsurges could be nipped in the bud by good surveillance and control of locust groups and swarms.‚Äù","locusts, changing, outbreaks, horn, swarms, cyclones, food, africa, desert, wet, climate, locust, linked, control",locust,idiosyncratic,"Since 2018, swarms of desert locusts have devoured vital crops and vegetation in the Horn of Africa, and scientists are drawing ominous links between this new reality, the warming climate and increasingly extreme weather.

‚ÄúUnusually heavy and widespread rainfall has made this plague more serious, impacting countries that had previously been hardly affected, such as Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda,‚Äù says Christiaan Kooyman, a scientific advisor and biopesticide expert in Kenya. ‚ÄúIt is fairly certain that climate change has contributed.‚Äù

The locust plagues are linked to powerful recent cyclones in the fast-warming western Indian Ocean, with the heavy rains, strong winds and soaked land creating ideal conditions for desert locusts to breed and spread.

The frequency and intensity of these cyclones are increasing. A recent commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change noted that 2019 was a record-setting year for the number of tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean, with eight making landfall. As part of this, the capital of Djibouti received the equivalent of two normal years‚Äô worth of rain in four days. Across the Red Sea, desert lakes formed in a barren, uninhabited region of Saudi Arabia known as the ‚ÄúEmpty Quarter.‚Äù

Concurrently, the frequency and severity of the locust outbreaks are also on the rise as the species transform dramatically under wet conditions, changing from solitary creatures to social ones that breed exponentially. Kenya, for instance, experienced its worst locust infestation in 70 years in 2019 and East Africa its worst desert locust crisis in 25 years, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

‚ÄúWhile desert locusts are an age-old threat, we fear something is changing,‚Äù the FAO said in a statement. ‚ÄúIf the current trend of increased cyclones continues, then the Horn of Africa is likely to face more locust outbreaks in the future.‚Äù

Drawn in by the vegetation and greenery resulting from the rains, desert locusts reproduce and disperse. With wet, warm and sandy soil optimal for laying eggs, several generations of desert locusts have been bred since 2018. The mature winged adults multiply rapidly and driven by the wind can migrate widely in search of food, flying upwards of 150 kilometers (90 miles) in a day. On the ground, the voracious pests, a part of the grasshopper family, can destroy huge amounts of crops. One square kilometer can hold a swarm of 40 to 80 million desert locusts, and in a single day a swarm can eat the same amount as roughly 35,000 people or six elephants.

Faced with an onslaught of desert locust swarms after a November 2020 cyclone led to an atypically wet December, local communities, NGOs and international and government agencies have fought back both in the air and in the field. The FAO and other groups have partnered with local aviation companies and scouts on the ground to spray pesticides in infested areas. The application of these chemical pesticides has also led to concern about the long-term impact on the environment. Rural farmers have also dug up locust eggs to expose them to birds and other predators, created their own organic pesticides extracted from oil of the neem tree to spray on locusts, and banged on drums and other containers to disturb them.

But these responders face a daunting battle against the swarms, particularly the species Schistocerca gregaria due to its clustering, gregarious nature, which spurs its rapid rate of reproduction. Already, the FAO estimates more than 1.3 million hectares of land with locust infestations have been treated since January, and air and ground control measures continue to roll out. Aid too has been distributed to rural communities hard-hit by the swarms that are now facing a food crisis in addition to the ongoing socioeconomic and public health challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Control operations and an anticipated return to drier conditions due to light-to-moderate spring rains are helping to curb the damage from this year‚Äôs desert locust outbreak. But officials are remaining vigilant as some new swarms continue to form in advance of the spring planting season in early April.

Looking ahead, experts are urging fixes to systems designed to prepare for and respond to these locust outbreaks. ‚ÄúThere is not always long-term thinking around environmental protection with something like desert locusts,‚Äù says Monique Bennett, a senior researcher with Good Governance Africa. ‚ÄúThere is a good scientific understanding of how to control for locusts, but lack of membership payment by countries within the DLCO-EA means there isn‚Äôt sufficient preparation when locusts break out. Governments do not invest in research and readiness when it does arise.‚Äù

Bennett says more regional coordination and funding for preventive measures and regional oversight is needed, particularly for the Desert Locust Control Organization for Eastern Africa (DLCO-EA). She also stressed the importance of investing in research and technology, developing early warning systems and stockpiling resources in advance of emergencies. Such preparations can lessen the costs of responding to outbreaks and the impact on food security and livelihoods in a region already experiencing acute hunger and other vulnerabilities.

‚ÄúThe predicted trend is that years of abundant rainfall will increase, though droughts will not likely disappear,‚Äù says Kooyman. ‚ÄúIt is therefore to be expected that plagues will occur more frequently at least in the central region [of Africa]. If funding were available in time, any locust upsurges could be nipped in the bud by good surveillance and control of locust groups and swarms.‚Äù"

Then, in a multidisciplinary collaboration, the researchers were able to isolate and characterize the dead locust ear and keep it alive, that is, functional, long enough to successfully connect it to the robot.
At the end of the process, the robot was able to ""hear"" the sounds and respond accordingly.

The result is extraordinary: When the researchers clap once, the locust's ear hears the sound and the robot moves forward; when the researchers clap twice, the robot moves backwards.

The interdisciplinary study was led by Idan Fishel, a joint master student under the joint supervision of Dr. Ben M. Maoz of the Iby and Aladar Fleischman Faculty of Engineering and the Sagol School of Neuroscience, Prof. Yossi Yovel and Prof. Amir Ayali, experts from the School of Zoology and the Sagol School of Neuroscience together with Dr. Anton Sheinin, Idan, Yoni Amit, and Neta Shavil. The results of the study were published in the journal Sensors.

The researchers explain that at the beginning of the study, they sought to examine how the advantages of biological systems could be integrated into technological systems, and how the senses of dead locust could be used as sensors for a robot. ""We chose the sense of hearing, because it can be easily compared to existing technologies, in contrast to the sense of smell, for example, where the challenge is much greater,"" says Dr. Maoz. ""Our task was to replace the robot's electronic microphone with a dead insect's ear, use the ear's ability to detect the electrical signals from the environment, in this case vibrations in the air, and, using a special chip, convert the insect input to that of the robot.""

To carry out this unique and unconventional task, the interdisciplinary team (Maoz, Yovel and Ayali) faced number of challenged. In the first stage the researchers built a robot capable of responding to signals it receives from the environment. Then, in a multidisciplinary collaboration, the researchers were able to isolate and characterize the dead locust ear and keep it alive, that is, functional, long enough to successfully connect it to the robot. In the final stage, the researchers succeeded in finding a way to pick up the signals received by the locust's ear in a way that could be used by the robot. At the end of the process, the robot was able to ""hear"" the sounds and respond accordingly.

""Prof. Ayali's laboratory has extensive experience working with locusts, and they have developed the skills to isolate and characterize the ear,"" explains Dr. Maoz. ""Prof. Yovel's laboratory built the robot and developed code that enables the robot to respond to electrical auditory signals. And my laboratory has developed a special device -- Ear-on-a-Chip -- that allows the ear to be kept alive throughout the experiment by supplying oxygen and food to the organ, while allowing the electrical signals to be taken out of the locust's ear and amplified and transmitted to the robot.

""In general, biological systems have a huge advantage over technological systems -- both in terms of sensitivity and in terms of energy consumption. This initiative of Tel Aviv University researchers opens the door to sensory integrations between robots and insects -- and may make much more cumbersome and expensive developments in the field of robotics redundant.

""It should be understood that biological systems expend negligible energy compared to electronic systems. They are miniature, and therefore also extremely economical and efficient. For the sake of comparison, a laptop consumes about 100 watts per hour, while the human brain consumes about 20 watts a day. Nature is much more advanced than we are, so we should use it. The principle we have demonstrated can be used and applied to other senses, such as smell, sight and touch. For example, some animals have amazing abilities to detect explosives or drugs; the creation of a robot with a biological nose could help us preserve human life and identify criminals in a way that is not possible today. Some animals know how to detect diseases. Others can sense earthquakes. The sky is the limit."""

The annual occurrences of extreme events has tripled since the 1970s and ""their economic impact is relentlessly increasing"", the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report.

""At no other point in history have agri-food systems confronted such an array of new and unprecedented threats, including megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats like the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the FAO said.

As a result, in poor and developing countries, lost agricultural production in the period 2008-18 came to $108.5 billion, FAO emergency and rehabilitation director Dominique Burgeon told AFP.

""Those economic losses can devastate the lives and livelihoods of people,"" Burgeon, said noting that more than two billion people depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Yet chemical pesticides remain the weapon of choice, accounting for 90 percent of the spraying in the current East Africa campaign.
Biopesticide development began in the late 1980s after the end of a years-long locust plague that stretched from North Africa to India.","hit, consequences, respectful, pesticides, solution, unauthorized, spraying, pesticide, plague, africa, fao, environmental, east, copyright, kenya, locust, locusts, dire",locust,idiosyncratic,"A swarm of locusts is awe inspiring and terrible. It begins as a dark smudge on the horizon, then a gathering darkness. A rustle becomes a clatter that crescendos as tens of millions of voracious, finger-sized, bright yellow insects descend on the land. Since late 2019, vast clouds of locusts have shrouded the Horn of Africa, devouring crops and pastureland‚Äîand triggering an operation of staggering proportions to track and kill them.

So far, a ground and air spraying campaign over eight East African countries, coordinated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has staved off the worst‚Äîthe very real prospect that the locusts would destroy the food supply for millions of people. Last year, the operation protected enough pastureland and food stocks, by the FAO‚Äôs calculations, to feed 28 million people in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen for an entire year.

But progress comes with yet-unknown consequences to the landscape, and responders have sought to find the elusive balance between eradicating the invading pests without destroying foliage and harming insects, wildlife, and humans. Northern Kenya is renowned worldwide for its bee diversity, and farmers and conservationists worry that bees are becoming casualties.

So far, 475,000 gallons (1.8 million liters) of chemical pesticides have been sprayed over 4.35 million acres (1.76 million hectares) at a cost the FAO says is $118 million. The spraying is expected to continue this year.

Assessments of possible environmental damage are incomplete at best, though the effects of pesticides have been well documented for decades in other settings. Broad spectrum pesticides are not only very effective at killing locusts, they also kill bees and other insects. They leach into water systems and can damage human health.

‚ÄúOf course, there is collateral damage,‚Äù says Dino Martins, an entomologist and executive director of the Mpala Research Center in Kenya. ‚ÄúAll these chemicals are designed to kill insects and they do so in very large numbers.‚Äù

Caught off guard

Kenya had not suffered a major locust invasion in 70 years. When the first swarms arrived in 2019, the country was woefully unprepared for what had been, quite reasonably, regarded as a remote threat.

‚ÄúThey had no equipment, no expertise, no pesticides, no aircraft, no knowledge,‚Äù says Keith Cressman, the FAO‚Äôs senior locust forecaster.

The swarms began forming in 2018 after cyclones dumped heavy rain on the inhospitable deserts of Arabia, allowing locusts to breed unseen in the wet sands. Strong winds in 2019 blew the growing swarms into Yemen‚Äôs inaccessible conflict zones, then across the Red Sea into Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

In the early stages of the locust control effort Kenya threw everything it had at the problem. ‚ÄúIt was a panic reaction,‚Äù says James Everts, a Dutch ecotoxicologist specializing in the environmental effects of pesticide use.

The spraying continued even as the COVID-19 pandemic spread and shuttered much of the world. Donning face masks against the coronavirus, hundreds of local volunteers, as well as members of Kenya‚Äôs National Youth Service, shouldered knapsack sprayers and, with minimal training, unloaded on the locusts with whatever pesticides happened to be in stock. They sprayed tens of thousands of liters of deltamethrin, as well as hundreds of liters of fipronil, chlorpyrifos, and other insecticides, many of which are banned in Europe and parts of the United States.

In one documented case in the northern region of Samburu, a ground control team sprayed 34 times the recommended dose of pesticide on a patch of ground, killing bees and beetles while spilling pesticide on themselves and crops.

‚ÄúIn the beginning it was an emergency,‚Äù says Thecla Mutia, who leads an FAO team monitoring the environmental effects of locust-control efforts in Kenya. ‚ÄúThe whole idea was to manage this as fast as possible to ensure food security.‚Äù

The FAO says, however, that it did not approve the use of volunteers in the campaign nor the spraying of pesticides not recommended for locust control.

Pesticides banned in Europe and the U.S.

Designed to kill, pesticides are toxic by definition, but they are also blunt weapons. Three of the four chemicals recommended by the FAO and authorized by regional governments‚Äîchlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, and malathion‚Äîare broad-spectrum organophosphates, widely used pesticides sometimes referred to as ‚Äújunior-strength nerve agents‚Äù because of their kinship to Sarin gas. The other, deltamethrin, is a synthetic pyrethroid, which is especially toxic to bees and fish, though much less so to mammals.

The FAO‚Äôs Pesticides Referee Group, which vets pesticides for use in locust control, lists all four chemicals as high risk to bees, low or medium risk to birds, and medium or high risk to locusts‚Äô natural enemies and soil insects, such as ants and termites.

The European Union banned chlorpyrifos early last year, and in the U.S. state bans have been enforced in New York, California, and Hawaii. Fenitrothion, too, is banned in Europe, but permitted in the U.S. and in Australia, where the government deploys it as a central weapon in the fight against locusts.

‚ÄúWe are not hiding what conventional pesticides are,‚Äù says Cyril Ferrand, FAO resilience team leader in Nairobi, who points out that doing nothing was not an option in the face of the rapidly expanding swarms. ‚ÄúWe want to lower the population of desert locusts in a way that is responsible.‚Äù

Non-toxic alternatives

Non-toxic biological alternatives that kill locusts, but do no other harm, have been available for decades. Yet chemical pesticides remain the weapon of choice, accounting for 90 percent of the spraying in the current East Africa campaign.

Biopesticide development began in the late 1980s after the end of a years-long locust plague that stretched from North Africa to India.

‚ÄúWhen we saw the figures of the millions of liters of pesticide being sprayed, even the donor community was horrified,‚Äù recalls Christiaan Kooyman, a Dutch scientist who developed the biopesticide using a fungus, Metarhizium acridum, that attacks locusts. ‚ÄúAnd they asked the scientists, ‚ÄòIs there nothing else we can do?‚Äô‚Äù

Metarhizium, which has been on the market since 1998, is recommended by the FAO as the ‚Äúmost appropriate control option‚Äù for locusts, yet is rarely used. It is slow acting with a low ‚Äúknockdown‚Äù rate‚Äîmeaning it kills over days rather than hours. It is expensive and tricky to apply. And it is most effective against immature ‚Äúhoppers,‚Äù rather than the adult swarms that are the greater threat.

Its best feature‚Äîthat it kills only locusts‚Äîalso makes it a less profitable product. Companies have little incentive to manufacture metarhizium and go through the costly bureaucratic process of registering it in a country until it is needed‚Äîand by then it is too late.

‚ÄúLocusts aren‚Äôt around very much, and manufacturers are not keen on producing something that doesn‚Äôt get used,‚Äù says Graham Matthews, a British scientist and the founding chair of the Pesticides Referee Group. When the swarms arrive, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to wait for production, you want it off-the-shelf,‚Äù he adds.

Instead, governments reach for the broad-spectrum toxic chemicals mass-produced by large agrochemical companies.

Extent of harm is unknown

What makes widespread spraying of chemical pesticides especially worrisome to farmers, herders, scientists, and conservationists in Kenya is that so little is known about what, if any, harm the pesticides have done. A U.S. government environmental assessment of the regional locust operation warned of the ‚Äúpotential for significant adverse impacts on environment and human health,‚Äù and a review by the World Bank found the environmental risk to be ‚Äúsubstantial.‚Äù

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Yet more than a year into the control campaign, the FAO‚Äôs assessment of the environmental impact of the spraying has not been made public.

‚ÄúThe excessive use of pesticides is of course detrimental to biodiversity, but it has not really been quantified as to what the level of impact is,‚Äù says Sunday Ekesi, an entomologist and director of research and partnerships at the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in Nairobi, part of a government task force set up to tackle the desert locust invasion.

‚ÄúOur key concern is the impact it has on the pollinators,‚Äù says Anne Maina, of the Biodiversity and Biosafety Association of Kenya. The farmers she works with attribute reduced honey and mango harvests to the disappearance of bees. Martins shares these concerns, but says the lack of monitoring information means it is impossible to know what‚Äôs really going on.

‚ÄúNorthern Kenya and the greater Horn of Africa is one of the world‚Äôs hotspots of bee diversity, with thousands of species, most of which we know absolutely nothing about,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe need to develop tools that allow us to both control locusts and protect the fragile biodiversity of the region‚Äôs drylands.‚Äù

The FAO‚Äôs 2003 guidelines on safety and environmental precautions acknowledge that aerial spraying may have less impact on human health than ground spraying, but often creates ‚Äúmore environmental concerns‚Äù because it risks contaminating ecologically sensitive areas. Aerial spraying increases the potential for ‚Äúuncontrolled drift,‚Äù whereby chemicals‚Äîmuch like the locusts themselves‚Äîare blown off course by the wind.

Mutia, the FAO‚Äôs team leader for environmental monitoring, insists that ground-spraying teams have become better trained and local communities are better informed about the spraying and the risks to themselves and their livestock. Kenya‚Äôs overall locust operation today has improved since the early weeks of the invasion.

‚ÄúDone right, the environmental impact is very low,‚Äù says Cressman.

A key report still under wraps

Still, Mutia‚Äôs environment and health monitoring report, finished last September, has yet to be made public. And there is confusion over why. The FAO says the report is for Kenya‚Äôs agriculture ministry to release, but a ministry spokeswoman says the FAO has yet to deliver it.

In an interview, Mutia says she found ‚Äúno cause for alarm,‚Äù in her review of the spraying.

However, a copy of the report obtained by National Geographic paints a more detailed and problematic picture, with evidence of heavy overdosing at the Samburu site and widespread lack of communication with residents in sprayed areas.

In four of the 13 sites inspected, there was no sign of locust deaths at all, suggesting either that the spraying had been ineffective or that the monitoring teams weren‚Äôt in the right locations. The report says they were repeatedly given inadequate location information and lacked the helicopters and other vehicles required to quickly reach more remote sites.

‚ÄúOur main concern has been the focus on control of the locusts without a parallel monitoring system of the undesired effects,‚Äù says Raphael Wahome, an animal scientist at the University of Nairobi. He says the FAO‚Äôs information should be made available to researchers and others: ‚ÄúYour guess is as good as mine as to what is happening wherever [the pesticides] have been used.‚Äù

In a bid to help locals get rid of the crop and livelihood-destroying infestations, a startup called 'The Bug Picture' is providing an extra incentive to harvest the insects at nighttime, a World Economic Forum report explains.

The firm pays local communities to harvest the insects and mill them, turning them into protein-rich animal feed and organic fertilizer that can then be sold.

Researchers say climate change is having a knock-on effect leading to unprecedented locust swarms. Warmer seas are creating more rain which wakes dormant eggs. Cyclones that disperse the swarms are also getting stronger and more frequency.

The Bug Picture strives to 'create hope in a hopeless situation'

The Bug Picture currently works with communities in central Kenya ‚Äî around the regions of Laikipia, Isiolo and Samburu ‚Äî an area that is particularly affected by the plagues.

""We are trying to create hope in a hopeless situation, and help these communities alter their perspective to see these insects as a seasonal crop that can be harvested and sold for money,"" said Laura Stanford, founder of The Bug Picture.

The Bug Picture is specifically targeting swarms of 5 hectares or less in areas that are not suitable for spraying.

Swarms can contain up to 80 million locusts per square kilometer and are capable of traveling up to 93 miles (150 km) per day.

The Bug Picture is paying one farmer, Joseph Mejia, and his neighbors 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.4566) for a kilogram of insects. Between Feb 1-18, the project harvested 1.3 tons of locusts.

""They destroy all the crops when they get into the farms. Sometimes they are so many, you cannot tell them apart, which are crops and which are locusts,"" said Mejia.

The locusts are collected at night by torchlight when they are typically found resting on shrubs and trees. Once collected, the locusts are weighed before being crushed and dried. They are then milled and processed into powder, which is used in animal feed and organic fertilizers."

Control operations continue in Ethiopia and Kenya against swarms that are still immature. Good progress has been achieved, particularly in Kenya where swarms are no longer arriving from the north. The swarms that are currently present in northern and central areas are smaller and much less numerous than one year ago. In Ethiopia, immature swarms remain in the south (South Omo, Konso), east of the Rift Valley in the Bale Mountains (Arsi, Borena), and to the northeast in the Harar Highlands (East Harerghe) where swarms were seen arriving from adjacent areas of northwest Somalia in the past few days.

Showers that fell during the last week of February may allow swarms to mature rapidly in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia and lay eggs that could hatch in late March, causing small hopper bands to form. However, breeding this spring is likely to be limited as control operations continue to reduce current infestations and well below-normal rains are forecasted.

In northeast Tanzania, there have been reports in the past few days of small immature swarms near Arusha in which some of the adults are starting to mature. These may be remnants of swarms that were previously treated.

In northern Somalia, late instar hopper hands are still present in the northeast (Puntland) and on the northwest coast (Somaliland) near Djibouti. New immature swarms continue to form in both areas and aerial control operations are in progress. The swarms are likely to disperse on the northern plateau, possibly reaching eastern Ethiopia near Jijiga and Dire Dawa. No reports of locusts have been received recently from central and southern Somalia.

In the Red Sea winter breeding areas, control operations are in progress against a few swarms on the central coast in Sudan where breeding is continuing. A few adult groups and small swarms could move inland to the Atbara and Nile river valleys. Local breeding is also underway on the central coast of Eritrea while the situation is calm further north near Sudan. In Yemen, low numbers of locusts are present on the Tihama coast.

In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue against hopper groups and bands on the northern Red Sea coast and against mature adult groups that are laying in the vast spring breeding areas of the interior. Early rains combined with unusually warm temperatures allowed ecological conditions to become favourable about one month earlier than normal, which could give rise to widespread hatching and band formation later this month.

Swarms currently present in Kenya and Ethiopia continue to decline due to ongoing control operations and no breeding. In the absence of rainfall, the swarms have remained immature and are awaiting the start of the rains to mature and breed. So far, these rains have not yet started but showers may occur by the of this month in some areas that could initiate breeding. Nevertheless, the seasonal predictions continue to call for well-below normal rains this spring, which could severely limit the scale and extent of any upcoming breeding.

In Kenya, a few small immature swarms were seen in the past few days between Mt. Kenya and the Rift Valley in Nyandarua, Nakuru and Baringo counties. In Ethiopia, immature swarms persist in the Ahmar Mountains east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi) between Awasa and Harar, but appear to be declining in southern SNNP (South Omo, Konso). In Somalia, late instar hopper bands are present in the northwest (Somaliland) and the northeast (Puntland) where a limited number of immature swarms continue to form. Other areas in the northeast are likely to contain locusts but cannot be accessed. Swarms that form in the northwest and northeast are expected to disperse along the northern plateau while some could move into adjacent areas of eastern Ethiopia near Jijiga and Dire Dawa.

There is cautious optimism of signs that the current upsurge is winding down in the Horn of Africa, especially if poor rains limit breeding this spring, followed by equally poor rains during the summer in northeast Ethiopia. However, it will be essential to sustain current survey and control operations in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, and maintain vigilance in case there is any unusual rainfall.

The situation remains calm in Yemen where scattered adults are present on the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts. As vegetation dries out further, a few groups and perhaps small swarms could form on the Red Sea coast and move inland across the highlands to the lowland desert between Marib and Wadi Hadhramaut where breeding could occur if rains fall.

In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue on the northern Red Sea coast between Bader and Umm Lajj against hopper bands and immature adult groups as well as in the interior where adult groups are breeding and more hatching is underway between Riyadh and Hail, causing hopper groups and bands to form.

In Sudan, limited breeding continues along the Red Sea coast near Tokar Delta where control operations are in progress against a few hopper bands and groups of hoppers and adults. In Eritrea, a few hopper groups are present on the central coast near Massawa.

Ethiopia‚Äôs crops for the Belg (rainy) season which starts in mid-February are at high risk due to the high number of swarms which may lead to egg laying and higher locust numbers during the crop, and high rains at the end of this month, and late March are also likely to make the situation more severe.

Esther Watts, CARE Ethiopia Country Director:

‚ÄúRains at the end of 2020 were higher than usual which has also helped create favourable conditions for further locust breeding and is a likely high driver for the intensity of these latest swarms. Ethiopia is currently facing a triple threat crisis with locusts, flooding from last year and COVID-19, and these latest swarms are a real worry and added stress on an already struggling population suffering from high levels of hunger, malnutrition and loss of livelihoods across many areas.

Climate change is also exacerbating the crisis; warming seas means more frequent or stronger cyclones, creating the perfect breeding ground for locusts. Heavy rains and mild winters then contribute to the survival of the large swarms that decimate food security and sources of income. Unfortunately, as climate change makes weather patterns in East Africa less predictable, the impacts for these communities already facing extreme challenges are only expected to get worse.

We are particularly worried about the impact the loss of crops and livelihoods will have on women and girls. The Amhara region, where CARE works, already has one of the highest rates of early and forced marriages in the country where as many as 48% of girls are married by the age of 15. Evidence shows that forced early marriage practices often increase during times of economic stress.

CARE is working in locust affected areas of Hararghe as well as northern Amhara, with livelihoods and resilience programmes that also cover desert locust response. We are providing over 2,700 families with cash to support livelihoods recovery. Prior to the conflict that erupted at the end of 2020, CARE was also planning to ramp up desert locust response in the Tigray region, but this has been superseded by its humanitarian response, and locusts in the area add a worrying dynamic to the other compounded humanitarian needs faced by many in that area.

For the near future, programming in Tigray will focus on restoring the disrupted agricultural input supply by supporting service providers, such as agrodealers, poultry farmers, and animal feed producers, so that farmers are prepared for the coming planting season, as well as contributing to the humanitarian response. ‚Äù

The Pavilion will support existing events such as the annual Gardeners‚Äô and Antiques Fairs, while offering a more attractive and practical venue for rental events.

These projects are the culmination of years of planning for the third century of this 1790s National Historic Landmark site, in a partnership between the non-profit organization Historic Locust Grove, Inc., that manages the site, and Louisville Metro Parks, the owner of the property. The projects have been designed to enhance the unique historic landscape and do not affect the historic house.

‚ÄúThese projects are supported financially by many generous donors from throughout the community,‚Äù said Hunter Louis, President of the Board of Historic Locust Grove, Inc. ‚ÄúThese exciting projects will add important new dimensions to one of Louisville‚Äôs favorite Historic Landmarks.‚Äù

Other funds raised in the recent $3M Capital Campaign will be used for pathways, interpretation, and improved access to the outbuildings that tell the story of the site‚Äôs history as the home of not only Louisville‚Äôs founders but also the enslaved workers of the farm. In addition, a Research Library within the existing Visitors Center will be created during this phase. A Phase II of the project is planned to renovate the lobby and Museum Store, and provide temporary exhibition space and a classroom.

The Pavilion and other building improvements were designed by DeLeon Primmer Architecture Workshop architects Roberto DeLeon, Ross Primmer, and Michael Gastineau. Landscape architects from Environs & Jones, Jodi Smiley and Sarah Kopke-Jones, designed the improvements to the grounds. Engineering support was provided by Tetra Tech, Kerr-Gruelich Engineers, and Structural Services, Inc. Exhibit design for the outbuildings is by Solid Light. Construction is by Woodbine Construction Co.

The projects are expected to be completed by late Summer or early Fall of 2021.

‚ÄúThis year with the widespread rain we were expecting trouble,‚Äù says the farmer, who lives in the Hanover district. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been horrific and has hit us quite badly.‚Äù

Marais says he hasn‚Äôt witnessed the scale of such swarms for many years. ‚ÄúWhen you see them on the horizon, it looks like dust from far ‚Ä¶ Next door to my farm we sprayed a swarm of about 500m by a kilometre and a half. You can think where they sit at night, they just eat absolutely everything. It‚Äôs just stalks there the next morning.‚Äù

While he fears the worst is not over, intensive pesticide spraying regimens seem to be working in his region.

‚ÄúA week ago, if you asked me I would have said we‚Äôre being overwhelmed. We‚Äôre starting to get some control now, but not completely, and there are other areas that are being very badly affected in the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape.

‚ÄúOur grazing is already compromised from the prolonged drought and now the little bit of food that is coming up is being decimated by the locusts.‚Äù

Another local farmer, Elsie Vermeulen* tells how the swarms are destroying her grazing land.

‚ÄúLast night, my workers sprayed a two-kilometre-by-three-kilometre swarm. Our area hasn‚Äôt got rain. So it‚Äôs very dry so when it‚Äôs getting through, it eats a lot.‚Äù

A previous outbreak around a decade ago was nothing like this year, she says.

‚ÄúWe have areas being sprayed here that have never been sprayed before. Some areas have up to 27 bakkies in one area that‚Äôs deployed. In the 30 years I‚Äôve been here, it hasn‚Äôt been this bad.‚Äù

Brown locusts are endemic to the semi-arid Karoo areas of South Africa and southern Namibia. The initial outbreaks started in September last year, with huge migrating adult swarms in November that infested parts of the Free State before being brought under control by authorities.

Dr Roger Price, research team leader at the Agricultural Research Council, says the current outbreak will slow down as the weather cools.

‚ÄúTime and time again, they‚Äôre only saved by the weather. This outbreak is normal, though this is a bit heavier than usual. It‚Äôs been bigger than most years but nowhere near a big outbreak.‚Äù

The Karoo probably has the highest outbreak frequency of any locust in the world, he says.

‚ÄúWe have outbreaks in the Karoo nine out of every 10 years but the last few years it‚Äôs been very quiet and people have forgotten about the locusts. But because they‚Äôve had drought breaking rains in September October and then follow-up rains, we‚Äôve had a very good locust season.‚Äù

The outbreak, he says, is medium-sized.

‚ÄúIt hit the news this year more than most because of social media. It‚Äôs normally hidden away in the Karoo. We have massive outbreaks in the Karoo that if the world knew about it would be world headlines.‚Äù

Ikalafeng Kgakatsi, the director for climate change and disaster management at the Northern Cape department of agriculture, environmental affairs, land reform and rural development, says the concern is that the locusts will move into irrigation areas in the Orange River or spill into the Free State.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with farmers and providing pesticides and we‚Äôve been trying to control the situation to make sure we minimise the locusts. We hope this rain will bring the cold quicker. That will help us because if it‚Äôs hot and wet, they keep on coming.‚Äù

The South African National Biodiversity Institute says that while South Africa has succeeded in managing locust outbreaks in some respects, the challenge lies in the changing climate, which might promote outbreaks.

‚ÄúThe country would benefit greatly from detailed studies focusing on understanding the impact of land use change, climate change and other global change challenges in relation to the brown locust.‚Äù

Control operations continued in Ethiopia and Kenya against swarms that remained immature throughout February. Good progress has been achieved, particularly in Kenya where the earlier swarm invasion from the north ceased and remaining swarms were smaller and less numerous than one year ago. Nevertheless, a few swarms crossed into northeast Tanzania and cross-border aerial control was carried out.

In the Red Sea winter breeding areas, adult groups and swarms formed mainly in Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, in Eritrea and Sudan.

In Sudan, limited control operations are in progress against early instar hopper bands on the Red Sea coast north of Tokar Delta.","immature, update, continue, situation, rains, ethiopia, 2021, 25, swarms, operations, desert, present, kenya, northern, locust, control",locust,idiosyncratic,"Swarms continue to decline in Horn of Africa

As a result of poor rains in Kenya and Ethiopia, the swarms currently present in both countries are remaining immature and continue to decline due to ongoing control operations. Without rainfall, the swarms will not mature and breed, thus severely limiting the scale and extent of any breeding this spring. The current situation is likely to continue for the remainder of this month as no significant rains are predicted to fall in northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia.

For this reason, there is cautious optimism that the current upsurge is winding down in the Horn of Africa, especially if poor rains limit breeding this spring in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, followed by equally poor rains during the summer in northeast Ethiopia. Nevertheless, it is essential to increase surveys and sustain current control operations in the affected countries as well as maintain a close watch for any unusual developments.

In Kenya, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi in Kajiado county near the Tanzania border and further north in Samburu county. Control operations are in progress, but some could not be treated as they are near communities.

In Ethiopia, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP.

In Somalia, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. A few hopper bands persist and at least one swarm was reported to be maturing in the same area. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. Most of the swarms are expected to remain on the northern plateau and perhaps drift west towards Jijiga and Dire Dawa in eastern Ethiopia.

In northern Tanzania, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of this month. Ground teams are treating a few small early instar hopper bands that have formed.

In Saudi Arabia, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast. However, control operations are in progress in the interior against numerous early instar hopper bands from hatching in the spring breeding areas near Gassim.

Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. In Sudan, limited control operations are in progress against early instar hopper bands on the Red Sea coast north of Tokar Delta. Scattered adults are present in a few other places on the coast between Suakin and Karora. In Yemen, a few adults are present on the southern coastal plains."

The robot at Tel Aviv University ‚Äúlistens‚Äù to sounds around it using the ear of a dead locust. Upon hearing one clap it moves forward; upon hearing two claps in quick succession it moves backward.

Researchers behind the breakthrough say it is the first time a sense organ has been integrated into electronics, and therefore a ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù that shows that the full sensory capacity of animal parts ‚Äî noses, eyes, ears and touch sensors ‚Äî can be harnessed and information they gather fed to machines.

‚ÄúWe decided to use an ear to demonstrate what we can do, but the big deal is the general principle that we can use animal sensory systems for robotic platforms,‚Äù Ben Maoz, one of the scholars behind the invention, told The Times of Israel.

He commented: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre showing that it‚Äôs possible to take the animal kingdom‚Äôs power for sensing, which is much greater than any invention humans have built, and integrate it into our technology.‚Äù



This is ‚Äúvery exciting,‚Äù he said, suggesting that insects like mosquitos, which are in plentiful supply and the use of which doesn‚Äôt tend to evoke strong ethical objections, will be the best source of body parts.

‚ÄúInsects are amazing, if you think about it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are super small and energy efficient but have remarkable detection and sensory capabilities.‚Äù

The team behind the breakthrough, Maoz, Idan Fishel, Prof. Yossi Yovel and Prof. Amir Ayali, published a paper detailing their achievement in the peer-reviewed journal Sensors.

Until now, scientists have experienced some success using skin and muscle tissue in machines, but not sense organs, Maoz said.

He believes that ‚Äúthe sky is the limit,‚Äù as animals have abilities unrivaled by even the most developed technological sensors. ‚ÄúFor example, some animals have amazing abilities to detect explosives or drugs, and the creation of a robot with a biological nose could help us preserve human life and identify criminals in a way that is not possible today,‚Äù he commented.

‚ÄúSome animals know how to detect diseases. Others can sense earthquakes. We can start to integrate some of these abilities into tech.‚Äù

To develop the locust-ear tech the researchers built a robot capable of responding to signals it receives from the environment, found a way to artificially keep the dead locust ear alive, and developed a way to communicate signals received by the locust‚Äôs ear to the robot.

Maoz said that the potential for using animal parts is so great that it may reduce the need to carry on developing increasingly advanced electronic sectors.

‚ÄúIt may make much more cumbersome and expensive developments in the field of robotics redundant,‚Äù he said."
