The Bug Picture is targeting swarms of 5 hectares or less in inhabited areas not suitable for spraying.
Sometimes they are so many, you cannot tell them apart, which are crops and which are locusts,” said farmer Joseph Mejia.
The Bug Picture pays Mejia and his neighbours 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.4566) per kilogram of the insects.
The insects are crushed and dried, then milled and processed into powder, which is used in animal feed or an organic fertiliser.","crops, laikipia, locusts, project, plague, animal, fight, swarms, feed, insects, making, locust, farmers, bug, pakistan, picture, stanford"

FAO also delivered three vehicles to MAIF under fund from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
During the training workshop that is funded by the United Kingdom, FAO experts on Desert Locust carried out theoretical and practical sessions to ensure fully understanding and knowledge is reflected in field activities during surveillance and control activities.
In the closing ceremony, Hussein Gadain, FAO Representative in Yemen stressed the importance of joining efforts to face agricultural pests like desert locust which represents a real threat to national food security and livelihoods in Yemen and neighbouring countries.
These vehicles will contribute to scale up of surveillance and control activities by agriculture offices’ field teams to curb Desert Locust outbreak in Yemen and enabling them to reach remote and hard to access areas.","fao, strengthens, agriculture, surveillance, yemen, capacity, training, including, control, desert, ministry, locust, kingdom, vehicles"

During the meeting, delegation members acknowledged the need to amplify efforts in the coming weeks and months to mitigate damage towards food security and livelihoods in Somalia due to desert locust infestation.
Substantial and timely funding is needed to scale-up operations to reduce desert locust populations.
Finally, all parties recognized that the risk for desert locust crop damage in 2021 remains high and alarming.
The Federal Government of Somalia, together with State Governments, FAO and other partners are strongly committed to coordinating emergency efforts and reinforcing their partnerships to rapidly scale up and sustain the response to the desert locust crisis.","fao, response, meeting, efforts, joint, emergency, critical, desert, locust, situation, somalia, communiqué, federal, needed, states, operations"

New outbreaks of the brown locust Locustana pardalina have been reported over a wide area of the Central and Upper Karoo in January and February 2021 following good rain.
“Over the past 40 years, brown locust plagues have occurred in 1985/1986, 1989/1990, 1994/1995, 2002/2001 and 2010/2011.
The biggest problem we have with locust control at the moment is that outbreaks are so widespread in the remote Karoo areas that the delay in communication between farmers reporting locusts and the locust spray teams being able to find the locust targets allows some locust outbreaks to escape,” Price says.
Farmers were urged to report outbreaks as soon as possible to their local District Locust Officer or to the agriculture department’s locust depots at De Aar and Upington.","brown, swarms, outbreaks, wide, reported, locust, karoo, locusts, past, alert, price, high"
