Worldwide, an average of 150 people are killed each year in avalanches, with roughly 27 of those in the US. This past week alone, 14 people in the US have died from avalanches, bringing the total deaths to 21 this season.

But avalanches can occur any month of the year and in mountainous locations around the world. If caught in an avalanche, time is of the essence and knowing what to do if caught in one, could save your life.

Why and where do avalanches happen?

An avalanche occurs when a layer of snow collapses and travels downhill rapidly. Even though avalanches can form anytime if the right conditions are present, there is typically a sharp increase in avalanche deaths during the months of January and February.

“All of them were beautiful people who love the outdoors,” said Anthony Nocella, a friend of one of the skiers who died in the massive slide. He spent Sunday going up and down the canyon getting updates on his friend.

“People in the community are really missing them,” Nocella said.

There were two separate groups of highly experienced skiers in the Wilson Glade area at the time of the slide, a group of five skiers and a group of three skiers, who were still making their way to the top, according to the Unified Police Department.

The 250-foot-wide avalanche swept all eight of them away.

It ended up being the deadliest avalanche in Utah since 1992.

Unstable conditions

Initial reports were that five skiers were buried in the snow and Salt Lake County Search and Rescue crews quickly descended on the mountain, hiking or being hoisted into the area, Unified Police Sgt. Melody Cutler reported on Sunday.

She said the group of five began skiing down the mountain as three more were still hiking up and it appears those five skiers triggered the avalanche, which sent nearly 3 feet of heavy snow down the hillside.

Four survivors, all men ages 23 to 38, were able to dig themselves out and were later hoisted off the mountain by Life Flight helicopters. None had life-threatening injuries.

Unstable conditions with a risk of additional avalanches prevented the recovery of the other four skiers until Sunday. All four bodies were recovered by Sunday evening, according to police.

Among the skiers who died was Sarah Moughamian, a 29-year-old market researcher who lived in Sandy. A native of Idaho, Moughamian grew up “playing in the mountains and climbing trees,” her mother, Jill Moughamian, said on Sunday. Keeping up with her brothers likely made her more adventurous, she said.

“She went east for college but couldn’t wait to get back to the West,” she said, adding that her daughter, the second oldest of five, found “the two loves of her life” in Utah — her soulmate, who dug her out of the snow but could not resuscitate her; and her love of the outdoors.

“She has spent all of her available free time in these last months climbing, skiing and mountaineering,” Jill Moughamian said. “She’s really lived her life to the fullest and was doing what she loved to do.”

Louis Holian, 26, of Salt Lake City, was another skier who was buried in the avalanche in Millcreek Canyon. His friend, Nocella, said Holian also preferred “being in the woods, not in the city.”

“He did whatever he wanted to do. He lived life to the fullest,” Nocella said. “He’s amazing. Everyone is going to miss him. Everyone is going to miss those four people.”

Others buried by the unexpected and fast-moving snow include Stephanie Hopkins, 26, and Thomas Steinbrecher, 23, both from Salt Lake City.

Nocella said all of the skiers caught in the avalanche “were highly, highly skilled ... they don’t mess around.”

“The wild can be wild. Just be careful (out there),” he said. “Always tell everybody you love them. You never know.”

A day to remember

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued a statement on Sunday expressing his condolences to the skiers’ friends and families.

“The tragedy in Millcreek Canyon which claimed the lives of four young Utahns has shaken and saddened all of us,” he said. “We also extend our sympathies to their companions who escaped harm and thank all of the brave individuals involved in the recovery efforts.”

Hunter Penrose narrowly escaped his own death in a separate avalanche that happened in the Uinta Mountains on Saturday. In a social media post, he said it “was one of the scariest days” of his life.

“It started out as any other day on the mountain,” Penrose said, adding that the snow was some of the greatest he’d ever experienced. “We entered an area we have been riding in since kids and were aware of the avalanche danger in the area.”

The experienced snowmobiler said the ground started shaking and he saw “a mountain of snow coming toward me.” Penrose was buried in the deep snow and while the others in his group were OK, “no one knew where I was.”

He knew he was buried but was ultimately able to reach the top of the snow with his fingers and got out alive.

Penrose cautioned other backcountry enthusiasts to “stay aware.”

Winter warning

The Utah Avalanche Center website crashed late Saturday and was able to increase its capacity Sunday after reporting at least 27 avalanches occurred on Saturday throughout northern Utah. Another 11 were reported on Friday.

The agency issued high-danger warnings for Utah’s backcountry early Saturday after new snow fell on a weak base of snowpack.

High Danger. Large natural avalanches overnight. Dangerous avalanche conditions. Keep it low angle. #utavy pcStetson pic.twitter.com/t7pAxOXDIX — UtahAvalancheCenter (@UACwasatch) February 6, 2021

Avalanche danger remained high Sunday for mountains north of Provo, the center reported.

The dangerous winter weather phenomenon has claimed lives in other states in recent days, including a snowmobiler in Montana, hikers in Alaska and skiers in the Colorado backcountry, among others.

A Park City man, also an experienced skier, was killed in an avalanche in Summit County last week.

The Associated Press reports that 21 people have died by avalanche this winter throughout the United States, 15 of them skiers, according to data from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. There are still more than two months left in the season.

Last year, by contrast, a total of 23 people, including eight skiers, died between December and April, the AP reported.

“Our hearts go out to loved ones of the skiers lost in Saturday’s avalanche,” Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera said. She said all eight skiers were prepared and had the necessary equipment for the conditions.

Rivera said the rescue team is made up of “highly trained volunteers that put themselves at risk to save others.”

“They perform technical, life-saving operations like this one, year-round,” she said.

Four skiers died in an avalanche in Mill Creek Canyon on Saturday, making it one of the most deadly slides in the era of modern recreation.

The skier-triggered avalanche swept up eight people in their early 20s to late 30s who were in two groups touring the backcountry, Unified police Sgt. Melody Cutler said. She said a group of three people were from Mill Creek Canyon and a group of five were from Big Cottonwood Canyon.

All the skiers were carrying avalanche safety gear, including beacons, shovels and probes, Cutler told The Salt Lake Tribune. Unified police first received a distress call at 11:40 a.m., Cutler said. The four survivors were able to dig out the skiers who died, she added, but the bodies may not be recovered until Sunday morning, depending on the chance of further slides and daylight.

The four who survived had minor injuries and are off the mountain. Two people survived from each group, according to Cutler.

Drew Hardesty with the Utah Avalanche Center said the victims were experienced skiers who were well known in the community, calling their deaths a terrible tragedy.

The avalanche happened near Wilson Peak, Hardesty said, on the ridge line separating Big Cottonwood Canyon and Mill Creek Canyon. He said it happened on steep, north-facing terrain.

The Utah Avalanche Center had deemed the avalanche risk in the area “high.” Hours prior to the slide, it tweeted out a warning that there was “High Danger. Large natural avalanches overnight. Dangerous avalanche conditions. Keep it low angle.”

(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Search and rescue crews respond to the top of Mill Creek Canyon on Saturday, Feb. 6, 2021, where four skiers died in an avalanche near Wilson Peak.

The slide had a depth of 2.5 feet and was 250 feet wide, according to the center’s preliminary report. Staff planned to visit the site Sunday.

Two other people have died in avalanches in Utah this year, a snowboarder on Jan. 8 and a skier on Jan. 30. In total, 20 people nationwide have died in avalanches during the 2020-21 season, 16 of which were skiers or snowboarders. The last time an avalanche took as many skiers or snowboarders was when five were killed near Loveland Pass in Colorado in 2013.

Utah Avalanche Center forecaster Toby Weed told FOX 13 on Friday that as of then, 10 people throughout the United States in the preceding week had not made it back from the backcountry to see their families because they triggered a deadly avalanche.

He said the avalanche risk is so high that it’s not about having the right equipment this weekend, it’s about avoiding the backcountry entirely.

“It’s not getting safer right now — it’s getting more dangerous,” Weed said.

Forecasters anticipate the weakened snow conditions to persist until the end of the 2020-21 snow season, the FOX 13 report said.

UPD has closed Mill Creek Canyon to recreation at least through Sunday, FOX 13 reported, but restaurants and businesses in the canyon will still be open.

Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said on Twitter that rescue teams were on site Saturday afternoon. Intermountain Healthcare sent three LifeFlight medical aircraft and crews to assist, spokesman Jess Gomez said on Twitter.

Four is the highest number of deaths in an avalanche in the Wasatch Mountains since 1914, according to the Utah Avalanche Center. It would also match the state record. Four people were killed in a skier-triggered avalanche in Gold Basin near Moab in 1992.

Three died in an avalanche that swept up 15 people in Provo Canyon near Sundance Resort in 2003.

Gov. Spencer Cox tweeted that the deaths are a terrible tragedy. He said people should exercise extreme caution because of the current avalanche conditions.

This is a terrible tragedy and our prayers go out to the victims and families involved. We are grateful to the first responders and others who engaged in this rescue and recovery effort. With avalanche danger high right now, please exercise extreme caution. https://t.co/2sxB85eh74 — Spencer Cox (@SpencerJCox) February 6, 2021

A skier triggered an avalanche in the nearby Alexander Basin area Friday, Hardesty noted in his Saturday report for the Utah Avalanche Center. That slide was two to three feet deep and up to 500 feet wide.

Hardesty also noted that the center knows of nearly 40 avalanches that slid over the past week in the mountains around Salt Lake City, but the “actual number is likely much higher.”

Saturday would mark a return to a lineup with most of the significant contributors that had been missing for a few weeks. Matt Calvert, Tyson Jost, Samuel Girard, Cale Makar and captain Gabriel Landeskog would all return to the ice as Jared Bednar’s lineup would get as close to 100% as it’s been all season.

The newly reinforced Avalanche would take the ice in an incredible looking environment. Pregame shots of the rink at Edgewood Tahoe Resort were breath-taking. With a clear blue sky that was both lovely to behold and a bad sign for the ice quality for the game. The teams walking out in their reverse retro uniforms didn’t do anything to harm the picturesque views. The full effect of the uniform was fantastic and even the Vegas jersey looked particularly sharp with the contrast of the Avalanche uniforms and scenery in Tahoe. NBC really got quite a looker for their marquee outdoor matchup.

The start of the game would be delayed with ice issues. I mention this as it would become a theme for the afternoon.

After a number of hurdles and an afternoon that was unlike any the NHL has ever seen, the Avalanche would eventually leave the rink at Tahoe with a 3-2 victory over the Golden Knights.

First Period

NBC’s normal NFL announcer Mike Tirico opens the broadcast with a statement of “We’re going to stop talking and let you listen to the sounds from the ice”. This lasted about 10 seconds. That was long enough for me to long for the option to turn the broadcast team off like it was a video game. The setting along with the sounds of skates ripping ice and pucks careening off boards would be an incredible audio/video package.

The full Avalanche lineup reuniting was also an incredible sight to see. Colorado jumped out of the gates quickly putting pressure on the Vegas defense. The Jost/Compher/Landeskog line was an interesting combination, with Landeskog driving play for the line and making Jost and Compher look more dangerous.

It wouldn’t take long for the Avalanche to capitalize.

Nathan MacKinnon has amazing vision. His cross ice pass found Girard and he ripped a wrist shot past Marc-Andre Fleury giving the Avalanche the lead with less than three minutes off the game clock. The play was started by a nice breakout pass from Rantanen to MacKinnon. These two would combine to test Fleury again numerous times throughout the period, especially when combined with Makar. The three Avalanche stars together on the ice turned five on five hockey into what looked like a Colorado power play.

The Avalanche would keep the pressure up, dominating the first ten minutes of play. Vegas responded around the halfway mark in the period, putting their first real pressure on Philipp Grubauer’s net. Grubauer held solid throughout, stopping all seven shots faced in the period.

To close out the first, Mark Stone got his stick up into the chin of Rantanen to draw a high-sticking penalty and blood from the Avalanche winger for a double-minor. The first unit would stay out for the first of the penalties and have some strong chances from Rantanen and Kadri, but Fleury would hold solid. During the line change, the Vegas penalty kill would get caught with too many men on the ice and hand the Avalanche nearly a minute and a half of five on three hockey. However, Fleury would make a sensational save on MacKinnon as the period winded down to keep the game within a goal.

The Avalanche controlled the first period, outshooting the Golden Knights 17-7. Vegas was a bit fortunate to only be down on goal after Colorado spent a majority of the period peppering their goal.

At the end of the first period there would be more problems with the surface of the Lake Tahoe facility and delay the game. The corners of the Avalanche defensive zone looked really wet, sloppy and slow as the period wore on and player safety was wisely cited as the reasoning for the delay.

Second Period

After nearly eight hours, the game finally got back under way and the change in ice condition was instantly noticeable. It wasn’t perfect, but the ice surface had clearly recovered in a huge way from the afternoon. The ice was a lot more solid and while it got beat up as the period went on, it was a vast improvement on the dangerous environment the players were forced to play through in the opening period.

Speeds were noticeably higher and the teams looked like they were better prepared to deal with the elements. The Avs came out flying and it took a tremendous effort from Fleury to keep the game at 1-0 early in the period.

Despite a ton of pressure from the Avs, Vegas was able to tie the game up when Alec Martinez put home a juicy rebound at 7:37 of the second frame.

The Vegas goal didn’t slow down the Avalanche as less than five minutes they regained the lead when the most electrifying man in hockey made the game 2-1. Nathan MacKinnon scored his fourth goal of the season and at the same time left Alex Pietrangelo in complete awe.

Alex Pietrangelo as Nathan MacKinnon was coming down the ice:



""Oh boy."" #NHLOutdoors pic.twitter.com/337XNC8wUm — #NHLOutdoorsAfterDark on NBC (@NHLonNBCSports) February 21, 2021

It turns out it’s not just the fans watching the games who are mesmerized by what Nathan MacKinnon does - the opposition is just as amazed.

The game got a little sloppier as the period went on. Both teams took a number of penalties but neither was able to capitalize on their turns with the man advantage. The score remained 2-1 going into the final 20 minutes.

Third Period

With Nazem Kadri already in the penalty box, the Avalanche went down two men when Cale Makar was sent off for delay of game. Despite the allure of assuming a 5 on 3 is a sure bet for a goal, the Avalanche were able to kill off 1:20 of a two man disadvantage early in the period - a penalty kill that could have turned the game completely.

For the first half of this period, it was Philipp Grubauer’s turn to bail his team out. The Avalanche netminder made some big saves and was able to maintain the 2-1 long enough for Devon Toews to score his fourth goal of the season - extending the lead to two. The point shot from Toews was aided by an absolutely perfect screen in front by Mikko Rantanen. Avs go up 3-1.

With the primary assist, Nathan MacKinnon recorded his third point of the game.

The two goal lead didn’t last long as a little more than a minute later, Alex Tuch pulled Vegas back to within one.

That’s as close as the Golden Knights would get as Grubauer would shut the door the rest of the way. He continued his hot play, making 12 of his 23 saves in the final period to shut the door on a 3-2 Avalanche victory.

With the win, the Avalanche pull within one game of Vegas for first place in the Honda West Division.

Up Next

After a memorable few days in Lake Tahoe, the Avalanche will return to the friendly confinds of Ball Arena Monday to put a cap on their four game series with the Vegas Golden Knights. The team is healthy, they’re flying and now is the time that they start to show the rest of the league who the true contenders are."

Outdoor hockey with a Lake Tahoe backdrop so beautiful, you almost swear special effects must have been involved. Two goals nine hours apart. Saturday’s (and you might also say, Sunday’s) Golden Knights – Avalanche outdoor game at Lake Tahoe offered up a ton of things.

Some of those things, like an amazing Nathan MacKinnon highlight, we might have expected. In other cases, there were events few could have seen coming.

But, considering the challenges involved, it’s remarkable that we got a winner. (You know, beyond whoever handles tourism in Lake Tahoe.) The Avalanche ended up beating the Golden Knights 3-2 to win their outdoor game at Lake Tahoe.

Sign there was a lot to take in: the Avalanche’s gorgeous Nordique-themed retro uniforms ended up being an afterthought. Quite the afternoon entire day of hockey, folks.

Breathe in the NHL outdoor game scene at Lake Tahoe

The scenery really deserves its own section. Maybe its own documentary?

Let’s take a few moments just to enjoy the mixture of how beautiful everything looked when Lake Tahoe provided the Avalanche and Golden Knights with a bit too much sunlight:

Actually, one photo doesn’t feel like enough for the afternoon glory of Lake Tahoe plus NHL outdoor hockey. Let’s sample another.

Are you muttering “Again” like Herb Brooks? Fair enough:

While the sunny first period provided the best material if you wanted to put together a hockey calendar, the scene was extremely cool even when it shifted to midnight ET. There was something cozy and almost intimate about the shadows, and the hockey sounds you could soak in without a crowd.

Oh yeah, the hockey

Maybe most importantly, the ice conditions were vastly improved. This opened up a canvas for Nathan MacKinnon to paint this masterpiece:

Just tremendous. A mic’d up Alex Pietrangelo admitted that there’s only so much you can do to stop Nathan MacKinnon in that situation.

Ultimately, MacKinnon ended up with three points (1G, 2A), keeping pace on a great night for top NHL superstars.

For significant chunks of the Avalanche – Golden Knights outdoor game at Lake Tahoe, the Avs carried play. That was especially true before the longest “first intermission” we’ve seen.

At times, especially when players like MacKinnon had the puck, it felt like the second and third periods could’ve been happening under climate-controlled conditions. A lot of that comes down to how talented these two teams are.

But there are limitations that come with playing outdoors. Could you chalk up some missed opportunities (both teams failed on strong 5-on-3 power play chances) to circumstances? Maybe. That said, it’s easy to see why the Avalanche and Golden Knights rank among NHL favorites, including what was on display at Lake Tahoe.

And give the goalies some credit. In particular, it’s impressive that Marc-Andre Fleury held down the fort in the hectic first period, making 17 out of 18 saves during the opening 20 minutes alone. Fleury was sharp, but it wasn’t enough.

Avs win a game that picked up late

Samuel Girard ended up scoring the only goal of the first period, which felt like the “first game.” After play resumed, Alec Martinez pounced on a loose puck to make it 1-1.

Then the Nathan MacKinnon goal happened.

For much of the third period, the Avalanche used their speed to stay a step ahead of the Golden Knights. A Devon Toews goal made it 3-1, but then the Golden Knights really started to push. Thanks to a power move by Alex Tuch, the Golden Knights brought it to 3-2. Vegas couldn’t get any more than that, though, so Colorado beat its (short-term?) division rivals.

All things considered, the Golden Knights, Avalanche, Lake Tahoe, and that Nevada sun combined for a memorable moment in NHL outdoor games. For fans who want more, the Bruins and Flyers will face off in their own NHL outdoor game at Lake Tahoe on Sunday.

Beginning Tuesday morning, other entities, including Silverton Medical Rescue, CAIC, Helitrax helicopter service and La Plata County Search and Rescue, joined the operation.
On Monday, CAIC had rated avalanche danger throughout the North San Juan Mountains as considerable near and above tree line.
As of Wednesday, the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management was urging users to avoid the Ophir Pass area to allow for the search to continue uninterrupted.","ophir, eagle, residents, search, pass, avalanche, caic, colorado, juan, rescue, confirmed, san, dead, skiers, county",avalanche,geophysical event,"“The red line marks descent and the blue lines mark the avalanches.

UPDATE: The deceased have been identified as Seth Bossung, Andy Jessen and Adam Palmer. The full, updated report is available here.

Search and rescue officials have been working since Monday evening in Colorado’s San Juan Mountains to find three skiers who went missing following an avalanche near Ophir Pass. According to the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management, the multiagency search has been ongoing since 5:20 p.m. on Monday and has experienced delays due to elevated avalanche hazard in the area.

The individuals involved in the avalanche have been identified as skilled and experienced backcountry skiers from Colorado’s Eagle County and were skiing around Ophir Pass’s Opus Hut, according to The Colorado Sun. While the Vail Daily has confirmed the names of the skiers, the paper is withholding those names pending an announcement by the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management.

According to a preliminary report released by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC), a party of seven was skiing on Monday on a feature off South Lookout Peak in the Middle Fork of Mineral Creek known as The Nose when the avalanche occurred. The avalanche caught and carried four skiers, breaking on a northeast slope above tree line near 11,500 feet. The group recovered one of the four individuals, who sustained minor injuries in the slide, but was unable to uncover the other three from the prominent gully beneath The Nose.

The rescue operation, which first involved the San Juan County Sheriff’s Department and San Juan County Search and Rescue, continued late through Monday night. Beginning Tuesday morning, other entities, including Silverton Medical Rescue, CAIC, Helitrax helicopter service and La Plata County Search and Rescue, joined the operation. As of Tuesday, the skiers had been located but not recovered.

“We are hoping for a successful recovery mission (Wednesday),” DeAnne Gallegos, public information officer for San Juan County, told the Vail Daily, adding that avalanche conditions have affected the recovery operation. Helitrax, based in Telluride, has assisted with avalanche mitigation in the area.

On Monday, CAIC had rated avalanche danger throughout the North San Juan Mountains as considerable near and above tree line. As of Wednesday, avalanche danger remained considerable, with concerns over widespread persistent slabs. “We have seen large and dangerous avalanches at upper elevations on northwest to north through southeast aspects in the last few days,” forecaster Mike Barney wrote in Wednesday’s Northern San Juan bulletin. “Upper elevation slopes can be triggered from below or remotely from a distance and should be treated with extreme caution.

Avalanche danger remains elevated throughout much of Colorado, with an incoming storm set to trigger a significant and widespread natural avalanche cycle in many regions. On Tuesday evening, CAIC issued an avalanche warning for Colorado’s Gunnison and Aspen forecast zones that extends through Friday morning. “There is little question that the avalanche danger will rise in the next 24 hours, to the point that backcountry travel will become very dangerous in the Gunnison and Aspen zones,” forecaster Ben Pritchett wrote in Wednesday’s warning.

Colorado has recorded four avalanche fatalities this season, including the deaths of Durango residents Albert Perry and Dr. Jeff Paffendorf on December 19, southeast of Ophir Pass on Battleship in the San Juan Mountains. The other fatalities occurred in the Anthracite Range and on Berthoud Pass, also in December. Over the last 10 days, CAIC has recorded 95 natural and human-triggered avalanches across the state’s southern mountains that forecaster Chris Bilbrey notes have been large enough to bury or kill a person.

As of Wednesday, the San Juan County Office of Emergency Management was urging users to avoid the Ophir Pass area to allow for the search to continue uninterrupted. We’ll update this story as more information becomes available."

Two people have died in separate avalanches in Colorado, bringing the state’s fatalities to 10 in the last three months.

A snowmobiler was buried in an avalanche west of Rollins Pass and a solo backcountry snowboarder was killed on the 12,477-foot Mount Trelease on Sunday.

The two deaths come after the nation recorded the deadliest avalanche week in more than 100 years earlier this month.

Ethan Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC), told ABC News this winter is shaping up to be the state’s worst avalanche season in modern history.

""This season is a 1-in-10-year event in terms of how soft the snow is,"" which makes it more prone to collapsing, Greene said.

The snowboarder, identified by the Clear Creek County Coroner’s Office as David Heide, 57, of St. Mary’s, Colorado, was alone when an avalanche struck around 9:30 a.m. and killed him. He deployed an airbag on his backpack, which is designed to protect him in an avalanche, but it failed to keep him from being buried in the snow.

The snowmobiler was a 58-year-old male from Parker who was out with his 18-year-old son when an avalanche struck. His son survived, according to Grand County Search and Rescue.

Both victims were in backcountry territory while the region was under a “considerable” avalanche danger warning by CAIC.

Colorado has just had a fresh dumping of snow and Gov. Jared Polis issued a warning on Friday to the backcountry community to steer clear of the mountains and read avalanche forecasts due to unstable snowpack.

An avalanche watch is in effect in Colorado for Aspen, Gunnison, Grand Mesa and North San Juan zones, with conditions forecast to worsen Monday night into Tuesday.

In Colorado, six avalanche fatalities have been recorded this month alone and a total of 10 have been recorded since Dec. 15, according to the CAIC. Officials said the yearlong average is six.

On Feb. 1, three men were killed in an avalanche near Ophir. Three days later, two skiers were caught in an avalanche near Vail -- one managed to dig their way out of the snow and the other died.

The deadliest year for avalanches in Colorado in modern times was in 1993 when 12 people were killed. In 2013, the state recorded 11 avalanche deaths.

Prior to that, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, more devastating avalanches took place that ran into towns and mines. The CAIC considers modern avalanches to be after the 1950s when they impacted people participating in recreational snow sports.

Jan. 31 to Feb. 6 marked the deadliest week in the US since 1910 for avalanches with 14 fatalities, according to the National Avalanche Center (NAC).

In the last year, 25 people in the U.S. have died from an avalanche, according to the NAC.

The CAIC is urging people to check the avalanche forecast before heading out, warning of “exceptionally soft snow pack.”

Experts say a weak base layer of snow combined with an increased interest in backcountry skiing amid the pandemic has contributed to the skyrocketing numbers.

They’re something either punctuating dramatic moments in films like Aspen Extreme or periodically popping up in the headlines from far flung locations. But lately, they’ve become an inescapable part of reality in the wake of a rash of accidents and an historic avalanche cycle in the Wasatch Mountains. The Utah Avalanche Center has even taking a central role in helping the New York Times cover the topic of avalanches and backcountry skiing. Avalanches have always been part of life and a present threat in Utah, and a perfect storm of circumstances has made them the center of conversation in 2021.

The tragic foundation of the surge in avalanche coverage is the spate of fatal avalanche accidents in recent weeks. Six avalanche fatalities occurred in the Central Wasatch over the course of a month, including two separate accidents along the Park City Ridgeline and a slide which killed four skiers in Millcreek Canyon. Nationwide, 15 people were killed during the first week of February, making it one of the deadliest weeks for backcountry users on record. Suddenly, avalanches became the focus of mainstream media coverage, and my phone started blowing up with text messages from people who’d never before used the term avalanche asking what was going on.

What’s going on is Utah’s currently plagued by a nearly unprecedented unstable snowpack. A dearth of snow early in the season with long periods of dry weather left deeply embedded layers of weak snow throughout the Utah mountains. Typically, early season snowpack instability begins to heal as snow accumulates throughout the winter, but this season’s uniquely unstable weak layers have been overloaded by sudden copious snowfall, overloading the slopes and leading to frequent, dangerously large avalanches. On Feb. 17, the Utah Avalanche Center forecast “Extreme” avalanche danger on all aspects and elevations, meaning avalanches were a certainty.

A near constant string of natural and human triggered avalanches has been occurring throughout the Wasatch, and Little Cottonwood Canyon has been closed since Monday night with people in the canyon subject to interlodge restrictions inside buildings. Massive storm totals over the past week wrought historic avalanches, bringing debris piles across the S.R. 210 on numerous slide paths, impacting buildings and covering parking lots at Snowbird and Alta. Huge slides were visible across the Park City Ridgeline, and roadside slopes in Big Cottonwood were releasing dangerous avalanches. The mountains are coming unglued in a way not seen in the past 30 years.

The uniquely unstable snowpack colliding with human factors is what has made 2021 the season of the avalanche. A surge in the popularity of backcountry skiing and snowboarding fueled in part by the pandemic making resorts less accessible has led to record numbers of backcountry travelers. Some inexperienced or unprepared backcountry users have been the victims of accidents, while other incidents have involved experienced users. Atypically sensitive avalanche conditions and increased pressure to avoid crowds are both likely contributing factors to the high number of accidents and close calls in Utah this year.

Ski resorts are wrestling with the combination of factors. Some resorts like Snowbird have been overwhelmed by new snow and widespread avalanche hazard, and have been unable to open for the past few days. Ski patrols are working furiously to mitigate danger and get the lifts spinning, but there’s only so much they can do in the midst of a relentless storm and avalanche cycle. Park City Mountain reversed course on decades of practice and indefinitely closed backcountry access from the resort. The resort has still not revealed how they plan to control access to the public lands beyond their boundaries, which have been the site of nine fatalities since 2000. Longtime backcountry skiers who have accessed National Forest land via the resort’s lifts generally advocate for some filter to help prevent unprepared or uneducated skiers from inadvertently accessing potentially dangerous terrain, but the community is anxious for resolution.

Utah’s finally getting blanketed in the snow it’s famous for, but the 2020-21 winter season has become dominated by avalanches, both literally and in the minds of skiers and snowboarders. Nary a chairlift ride goes by without someone broaching the subject, regardless of where they hail from. Anyone accessing the backcountry should have the proper tools and education, and those looking for a place to get started should visit the Utah Avalanche Center’s website. Enjoy the powder, but stay safe while doing so.

Colorado’s offense has continued its scorching-hot run. The unit has scored 46 goals in its last 10 games combined. This prop has cashed in eight of its last nine contests, and even at a moderate favored price, we’ll continue to back this trend tonight against an Arizona squad that is still riding with a pair of unproven goaltenders.

Third Period OVER 2 Goals (-104, DraftKings)

Most people are aware of the trends of betting totals in the first period, but you can also wager on the second and third period numbers pre-game, and find some good value with those options. That’s the case in tonight’s showdown.

Arizona has played 8 of its last 10 games with at least goals scored in the third period games, while Colorado is 6-4 to the over as well. This is a great price to back with this prop, especially given the fact that if a team is trailing late, they will pull its goalie for an extra attacker, giving us a great chance to cash with an empty net goal.

Arizona pulled off the big comeback win over Colorado in the last meeting, but that was due in part to the horrid goaltending of backup Jonas Johansson to start the game.

The Avs came out flying and attacked the Arizona Coyotes with a relentless effort that netted five goals in the first 7 minutes, 31 seconds of the game. Winger Joonas Donskoi scored three of those goals, producing the quickest hat trick in club history and the first three-goal period since Tomas Fleischmann scored three in the third period on Dec. 15, 2010 at Chicago.

The fast-and-furious start fizzled but the Avs regained their magic with a three-goal third period and skated off with a 9-3 victory before frontline staff, health care providers, first responders and select others. Colorado’s first five goals were scored in a span of 3:27, a club record surpassing the previous mark of 4:35 from last season against Nashville.

“What a first period, what a first 7 1/2 minutes from (Donskoi),” said Gabe Landeskog, one of seven Avs with a multiple-point game. “That was pretty incredible to watch.”

“It’s just so much different playing in front of fans. We miss it as a team and we wanted to put our best foot forward and I thought we did that in the first period,” Avs coach Jared Bednar said. “I love the balanced attack with all those guys getting on the scoresheet.”

The victory extended Colorado’s points streak to 12 games (10-0-2) and, coupled with Vegas’ 4-2 loss against the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday, the Avs (23-8-4) leapfrog the Golden Knights for first place in the West Division.

The Avs finished 12-2-3 in March to set club records for wins and points (27) in a month and tie the record for fewest games to reach 50 points in a season (35). The Stanley Cup-winning team of 2000-01 also produced 50 points in its first 35 games.

“It just goes to show you how dedicated our guys have been and just trying to find ways to improve and be consistent and developed the winning habits that are going to be needed come playoff time,” Bednar said. “That’s what we’ve been talking about from Day 1 of training camp. I think our buy-in from our guys has been exceptional, our leadership has been doing a great job reiterating our coaching staff’s message. Guys are playing hard, they’re playing the right way and they’re playing for one another.”

He added: “First place (in the West) only counts when the season’s over but it’s certainly something we’ve been working towards, trying to chase Vegas down after a little rocky start.”

Goalie Philipp Grubauer, who allowed a goal on Arizona’s first shot, finished with 24 saves for his NHL-leading 22nd win. Landeskog and right winger Mikko Rantanen each had three points, one behind Donskoi. Landeskog scored twice and Rantanen had two assists.

Forwards Andre Burakovsky and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare also scored as the Avs built a 5-1 lead through the first 7:16. Coyotes defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, however, scored late in the first period and Arizona forward Conor Garland struck late in the second as the visitors got within two at 5-3.

Landeskog scored an unassisted goal just 21 seconds after Garland to get Colorado back up by three heading into the third. Rantanen scored a power-play at 6:05 of the third period to put the Avs back up by four and Landeskog tacked on one at 11:57 for Colorado’s third eight-goal game of the year.

Burakovsky scored his second of the game at 16:49 off a beautiful assist from Donskoi.

Goalie Adin Hill started for Arizona but stopped just six-of-10 shots before getting pulled at 6:04. He was replaced by Ivan Prosvetov, who made his NHL debut and allowed Donskoi’s third goal 1:27 later.

The Avs improved to 5-1-1 against Arizona, with the eighth and final meeting between the teams April 12 at Ball Arena.

Footnotes. Avalanche star center Nathan MacKinnon was given a double-minor for roughing and 10-minute misconduct after he and Garland got into a tussle behind the play. MacKinnon’s misconduct stemmed from him removing Garland’s helmet and then throwing it at him. MacKinnon’s 14 penalty minutes in the game is two more than what he had in 69 games last season, after which he won the Lady Byng Trophy as the “player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.” … Avs winger Logan O’Connor suffered a lower-body injury in the first period and did not return. … Donskoi lost the steel blade to his left skate early in the second period, forcing him to hop on one leg to the bench. … The Avs have a plus-47 goals differential, by far the highest in the NHL.

The experienced backcountry snowboarders weren’t injured, but the avalanche buried a service road in about 20 feet (6 meters) of snow and came dangerously close to Interstate 70, a major route for ski traffic. As soon as they were safe, the two men called 911 to report the slide and spent two hours at the scene — an area popular with backcountry users — describing what happened. They shared the video and offered to send photos. They thanked investigators for showing up. Hannibal described the interaction as cordial.

Weeks later, the snowboarders were stunned when they got word they were being charged with reckless endangerment.

DeWitt and Hannibal didn’t immediately realize the slide destroyed an expensive avalanche mitigation system.

Prosecutors also are seeking $168,000 in damages in a rare case some worry could deter other skiers and snowboarders from coming forward to report avalanches out of fear of costly retribution. Backcountry enthusiasts and avalanche prevention specialists will be closely watching the trial, which was set to begin Thursday but was rescheduled because not enough jurors could be seated.

Hannibal, 26, of Vail, said in an interview with The Associated Press that several people have already told him they are reporting avalanches anonymously to avoid getting slapped with charges.

“Most people, if not everybody that travels in the backcountry, wants to make it safer and wants to report avalanches,” he said. “But as far as reporting avalanches with your name attached to it, I think that might drop significantly.”

Summit County District Attorney Heidi McCollum declined to address the specifics of the case but said the charges and the possible restitution are appropriate. She noted the mitigation system destroyed by the slide was paid for with taxpayer dollars.

McCollum disagreed that the case would deter backcountry users from reporting avalanches.

“Whether or not someone chooses to report any of their actions which may have injured another person or may have injured property is going to be within their own personal constitution. And the outcome of one misdemeanor trial in Summit County, Colorado, is not going to change what one individual would otherwise do,” she said.

Investigators cited Hannibal’s video in an affidavit explaining the misdemeanor charge, which carries a penalty of up to six months in jail but will most likely result in probation and community service.

It shows the snowboarders making “several comments” expressing concern about risks, according to Summit County sheriff’s deputy Brian Metzger.

“The pair were clearly worried about avalanche conditions but proceeded down the path anyway,” he wrote. “There was also a comment made about being in trouble if the cops show up.”

Those remarks are likely to come up during the trial, as is a detail from the avalanche center’s report, also reviewed by Metzger, suggesting the snowboarders might have misgauged the hazard on the slope.

The March 25, 2020, slide, which was about 400 feet (122 meters) wide and ran about 1,200 vertical feet (366 vertical meters), destroyed one of six O’Bellx avalanche mitigation units in the area.

The remotely operated devices are part of a statewide system controlled by the Colorado Department of Transportation. They ignite a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen that causes an explosion aimed at safely triggering avalanches, which have killed 35 people across the country so far this winter, including 12 in Colorado.

The Colorado Attorney General’s Office is among those raising concerns about the message being sent by the criminal charges. The office filed a motion to quash testimony from the director of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center — a state agency — and one of its avalanche forecasters.

Advertising

The motion, which was denied, argued the testimony could have an “unintended adverse ‘chilling’ impact” on the avalanche center’s ability to collect photographs and videos from people involved in backcountry accidents because they fear the information could be used against them.

Hannibal insists he and DeWitt did everything they could to navigate the terrain as safely as possible, and he said he never thought the information they gave investigators would be used against them.

“We concluded there’s no hard feelings,” he said. “Obviously they were glad that we called it in when we did and we handled it professionally.”

DeWitt, 38, of Silverthorne, even planned to send sheriff’s investigators further images of the slide, and he finished his handwritten statement from the scene with, “Thanks for showing up.”

Avalanche center director Ethan Greene, who helped write the incident report, said he hopes the criminal case doesn’t scare people away from reporting slides to the agency, which uses the information to compile daily backcountry avalanche forecasts during the winter and to warn of possibly dangerous conditions.

He also noted that the avalanche center gave the report and helmet cam footage to investigators because, as a state agency, it is subject to the Colorado Open Records Act.

Denver attorney Jason Flores-Williams, an avid backcountry skier who is representing DeWitt and Hannibal, said the case raises questions about a state agency acting on behalf of law enforcement, as well as issues involving excessive fines. But he stressed that he is defending the snowboarders because a guilty verdict would set a dangerous precedent.

“If you do everything that you need to do, they still might try to come after you and financially cripple you,” he said. “That is the implication of what a guilty verdict would mean here, is it would send a message to everyone that the backcountry is now subject to prosecution. Our goal is to defend the backcountry.”

Judge Edward Casias rescheduled the trial for June 7."

The Sabres received Colorado's sixth-round draft pick in a trade agreed to a day earlier. The Sabres had to wait for COVID-19 testing results after the Boston Bruins, their most recent opponent, had four players enter the NHL protocol Friday.

Buffalo also had to wait for goaltender Michael Houser, who was signed Friday, to clear waivers to avoid having to call up a goalie from the minors.

The Avalanche have relied heavily on starter Philipp Grubauer this season, with backup Pavel Francouz sidelined by a lower-body injury. Hunter Miska has filled in for Grubauer at times, but he’s struggled and has a 4.16 goals-against average.

Miska was recently sent down to the Colorado Eagles of the American Hockey League, with Adam Werner recalled from the Eagles.

Johansson was 0-5-1 in seven games for the Sabres this season, with a 3.79 goals-against average and an .884 save percentage and has an overall record of 1-8-2. The 25-year-old was a third-round pick by Buffalo in 2014.

“We’ll look at him here first and make a decision on what our plan is for him,” coach Jared Bednar said after the Avalanche beat Minnesota 6-0 on Saturday behind a 31-save performance from Grubauer. “He’s been on a steady progression getting better and on a good development path.”

Johansson received increased playing time with the Sabres after starter Linus Ullmark sustained a lower-body injury last month. Ullmark is expected to miss another few weeks.

Grubauer has been spectacular despite the heavy workload. He’s the first Colorado goaltender to start at least 20 of the team’s first 25 games since Semyon Varlamov in 2012-13.

The 29-year-old Grubauer has 18 wins this season, which ties a career high. Saturday marked his fifth shutout this season — the most by an Avalanche goaltender since Varlamov had five in '14-15.

“It's awesome to have that reliable goaltender in the back end there,"" forward Tyson Jost said. “He’s been great all year. We need that from him to continue throughout the year.”

Colorado’s defense has been a big help, too. The team had held opponents to under 30 shots in a franchise-record 18 straight games before it was snapped by the Wild on Saturday.

The Avalanche boasted an 18-8-2 halfway through the season. Their .679 percentage was the third-best mark at the midway point since the team moved to Denver.

The Sabres are in sell-off mode while in an 0-11-2 skid and in jeopardy of extending their playoff drought to an NHL-record matching 10th season.

This is expected to be the first of many trades for Buffalo. It comes three days since first-year general manager Kevyn Adams hinted a roster shakeup was coming after firing coach Ralph Krueger.

We are looking forward to it. We've played in some building already this year where there has been some fans, and it just brings a whole other element to the game and that's why these guys play. They love to perform and to do it in front of our fans is going to be awesome.

ROSTER REPORT

Defensemen Bowen Byram and Cale Makar returned to game action after missing the previous nine and 10 outings, respectively, with upper-body injuries. Byram began the game on a pairing with Ryan Graves while Makar was with Devon Toews. Samuel Girard and Jacob MacDonald made up the third pairing. Colorado did not make any changes to its forward combinations, and Philipp Grubauer was between the pipes for the 24th time this year. J.T. Compher, Greg Pateryn and Dan Renouf were the Avs' healthy scratches.

INJURY UPDATE

Forward J.T. Compher has been cleared medically to play but did not suit up as head coach Jared Bednar wanted to get the center some more conditioning time before his expected return to the lineup on Saturday. Young D-man Conor Timmins is out with an upper-body injury while Pavel Francouz (lower body) and Erik Johnson (upper body) remain out long term.

Hogwarts Legacy lead designer Troy Leavitt has quit Avalanche Software, following a backlash over the content of his personal YouTube channel.

Speaking on Twitter, Leavitt announced his decision to leave Avalanche, and said he has ""nothing but good things to say about the game, the dev team, and WB Games.""

Leavitt emphasised the decision as his own, adding that he ""felt absolutely secure in my position... I'm in excellent spirits and very pleased with my relationship with WB and Avalanche.""

However, Leavitt promised to clarify his reasons in a new video, which will be published on his YouTube channel in the near future.

Leavitt's YouTube channel is at the root of the issue. As Kotaku pointed out, his videos contained many controversial opinions, including defences of public figures accused of sexual misconduct, and qualified support of the fundamentally misogynist GameGate movement.

These positions were compounded by Leavitt's proximity to the Harry Potter IP, the creator of which, J K Rowling, has been widely criticised for her statements about the trans community.

In a recent op-ed, Brendan Sinclair explored the link between Leavitt's views and those of Rowling, and the nature of ""cancel culture"" -- you can read it here."

France's former world champion snowboarder Julie Pomagalski has died aged 40 in an avalanche in Switzerland, the French Olympic Committee announced on Wednesday.

""Julie's tragic disappearance has left the French Olympic team in mourning for one of their own,"" the CNOSF said on Twitter.

Pomagalski was one of two French freeride snowboarders to perish in the avalanche when skiing off-piste in a group of four people on Tuesday.

Police in the canton of Uri said the two died coming down the 2,961-metre Gemsstock summit, favoured by off-piste skiers for its steep slopes and abundance of powder snow.

""For reasons still unknown a sheet of snow broke away"" and three of the group were swept away.

Pomagalski and the other skier ""were completely buried"" while the third person suffered only ""light"" injuries and was able to escape.

The Ski Chrono website identified the second fatality as Bruno Putelli, a mountain rescuer from Albertville.

Pomagalski was crowned world champion in snowboard cross in 1999 and claimed the World Cup title for the discipline in 2004 and registered nine wins on the world Cup circuit.

She competed in the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and in the 2006 Turin Games.

The Colorado Avalanche still have their goalie issue.
Unfortunately, other GMs aren’t stupid, so they know the Avalanche desperately need a backup goalie.
So, what are the Colorado Avalanche going to do?
The trade deadline is April 12, and Sakic hates to be idle on that day, but it’s unlikely he’ll find an adequate backup goalie.","arizona, goalie, grubauer, team, avalanche, trade, woes, unfortunately, colorado, backup, didnt, feel",avalanche,geophysical event,"GLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 22: Goaltender Jonas Johansson #35 of the Colorado Avalanche warms up before the NHL game against the Arizona Coyotes at Gila River Arena on March 22, 2021 in Glendale, Arizona. The Avalanche defeated the Coyotes 5-1. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)

The Colorado Avalanche do not seem to have solved their issue with backup goal tending. How much will it cost the team?

The Colorado Avalanche still have their goalie issue. While Philipp Grubauer has been on fire lately, you can’t play just one goalie all season. Your starter needs a backup.

The Avs started out weak in this position to begin with. Their goalie tandem of Grubauer with Pavel Francouz may have been good enough for the season, and maybe even the playoffs. However, they didn’t have enough beyond that — only untested rookies.

They should have known better. Andrew Hammond stole a playoff game for the Avs a few years ago because both their starting goalie (Semyon Varlamov) and backup (Jonathan Bernier) were out with injuries. They know better than anyone that injury can take out anyone at any time.

Sure enough, Francouz suffered an injury in practice right at the beginning of the season. He was put on long-term injured reserve in February. While he was seen at a practice recently, he’s not expected to return any time soon.

That injury exposed the Avalanche’s Achille’s heel — lack of backup backups. With Francouz out, they relied on one of their green youngsters to back Grubauer up — Hunter Miska. Unfortunately, Miska wasn’t up to snuff.

Side rant: Miska ended up having to delete his Twitter account because so-called fans were harassing him about his play. Tyson Jost did the same thing for the same reason. That behavior from so-called fans is completely unacceptable.

So, GM Joe Sakic did go out an make a trade. Unfortunately, other GMs aren’t stupid, so they know the Avalanche desperately need a backup goalie. It seems that the best Sakic could do was trade a sixth-round draft selection to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie Jonas Johansson.

Johansson didn’t come highly recommended. Coming to Colorado, he had a 1-8-2 career NHL record with a 3.40 goals-against average and a .888 save percentage. That’s not great.

The team stated, “He’s been on a steady progression and getting better and on a good development path.” That sounds like a goalie for the future, not the backup we need now. Colorado already has three goalies who might have a future with the team.

Johansson didn’t exactly inspire confidence in his debut with Colorado yesterday. He made 28 of 32 shots for a save percentage of .875. He let in a couple of soft goals. The team lost in the shootout to the Arizona Coyotes.

That’s not all on Johansson, of course. Indeed, the team’s defense should have shut down around their new goalie and never allowed 32 shots. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen enough.

So, what are the Colorado Avalanche going to do? Well, we’ve probably seen it — the Johansson trade. The trade deadline is April 12, and Sakic hates to be idle on that day, but it’s unlikely he’ll find an adequate backup goalie.

Most likely we’ll watch the team rely heavily on Grubauer and relegate games to losses when they have to rest him. It shouldn’t cost the team the playoffs, though it might cost them positioning. We just have to hope Grubauer stays healthy."

Through his NHL tenure, the Rosenheim, Germany, native has posted a 97-59-20 record with a .921 save percentage and 2.34 goals-against average in 98 appearances with the Avalanche and 101 with the Washington Capitals.

Philipp Grubauer will be in net this evening for the Colorado Avalanche when the team opens up a back-to-back set at the Arizona Coyotes.

Grubauer has won six straight games, matching his career-long win streak and ranks first in the NHL in games (25), starts (24-tied), shutouts (5) and goals-against average (1.74) this year. He is also second in the league in wins (18) and third in save percentage (.929).

The only change that the Avs are expected to make to its lineup is that Grubauer will be backed up by Jonas Johansson instead of Adam Werner. Colorado acquired Johansson from the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday and he could make his Avalanche debut on Tuesday in the second half of the back-to-back, but head coach Jared Bednar said that decision will be made after tonight's game.

Bednar did have some good news after Colorado's morning skate regarding young defenseman Conor Timmins. Timmins last played on March 6 and has missed seven games with an upper-body injury but Bednar noted that he been skating for ""quite some time"" and is progressing.

Timmins could be cleared soon, though he remains day-to-day, but Bednar said he ""would like to think that it's going to be here in the near future.""

This evening's contest opens the fifth back-to-back set of the season for the Avalanche and the second of the year in Arizona. The Avs defeated the Coyotes in both meetings when they met on consecutive nights on Feb. 26-27. In that set, Colorado won 3-2 in the first outing and 6-2 in the second.

In total, the Avalanche has played four back-to-backs so far this year and gained points in seven of those eight total games (5-1-2) with a 3-1-0 mark in the first half and a 2-0-2 record in the second.

It would be a rough night for goaltenders, as both Colorado and Arizona started backups. Jonas Johansson would make his first start for Colorado, and despite a really rough start, would play decently enough to give Colorado a chance to win.

Nathan MacKinnon would have a high-event game; involved in an incident that will be replayed and discussed throughout the rest of the week as well as scoring his 200th career NHL goal.

Pregame

The Avalanche came into tonight’s matchup with Arizona on the back of an eight game winning streak after dominating the Coyotes 5-1 in the first game of the back-to-back at Gila River Arena.

With less than 24 hours between the end of last night’s game and puck drop tonight, Johansson gets his first start for the Avalanche. Adding to the changes for Colorado, JT Compher and Bowen Byram were both scratched. In their place, Dan Renouf and Logan O’Connor rejoin the Avalanche for tonight’s contest.

JT Compher and Bo Byram out #GoAvsGo — Lauren Jbara (@laurenjbara) March 24, 2021

Arizona had to make a few changes as well, with both goaltender Antti Raanta and defender Niklas Hjalmarsson both sent to IR. To replace Raanta, the Coyotes recalled Adin Hill for tonight’s start while Jason Demers would take Hjalmarsson’s slot in the Arizona defense.

First Period

The Avalanche would have an absolute disaster start in front of Johansson. The first shot of the game would find the back of the net from Jakob Chychrun.

The Avalanche wouldn’t waste much time giving up a second goal. This time, Johansson couldn’t do a thing, as the first line and top pair would leave him helpless to stop a cross-crease one-timer from Alex Goligoski to stake the Coyotes to an early two goal lead, having taken only three shots on goal to this point.

This seems to be part of a worrying trend for Colorado of getting off to horribly slow starts when Philipp Grubauer isn’t between the pipes. Not only would the Avalanche find themselves down two goals before five minutes could tick off of the clock, they were spending most of that time pinned into their own defensive zone. This would extend to nearly halfway through the first period, as Colorado would go over NINE minutes without putting a shot on goal.

A decent chance from Jost that hopped over his stick to prevent him from taking advantage of a nearly open net and a solid shift from the Nazem Kadri line would start to tilt the ice back in Colorado’s favor. The pressure would result in Chychrun taking a tripping penalty and putting Colorado on a crucial power play.

It wouldn’t take long for the Avalanche to convert with a goal from the captain, Gabriel Landeskog.

Landeskog’s tenth goal of the season got the Avalanche back into the contest, but an unlucky Jost high-sticking penalty would threaten to hand the momentum back to Arizona almost instantly. Fortunately for the Avalanche, their penalty kill was up to the task, denying the Coyotes a chance to recapture momentum.

Colorado would close out the period in style, with Mikko Rantanen’s hot hand reaching a volcanic level, burying a ridiculous Nathan MacKinnon backhand pass into the top corner to tie the game up with less than two minutes left in the period.

The period would end knotted at two. Despite the slow start, Colorado still out-shot Arizona 11-8 in the period.

Second Period

After an exciting first period, the second frame of the contest would slow the game down and put a highlight on the NHL’s referees.

During the second period, news came out of Nashville about a referee getting caught on a hot mic admitting to wanting to give a makeup call.

**WARNING** NSFW - LANGUAGE

Now, generally news from another game wouldn’t occur in a game recap, but this happened.

Dangerous collision between Nate MacKinnon and Jakob Chychrun. Mackinnon gets four-minute high-sticking penalty pic.twitter.com/u81N1EElKr — Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) March 24, 2021

While there is no debating the four minute double minor on MacKinnon, there was no call on Chychrun lunging into the path of MacKinnon and causing the collision. This would put Arizona on a huge man-advantage in a tied game. Fortunately for Arizona, Chychrun would return to play later in the game.

The Avalanche penalty kill would step up and show why it is one of the best in the league. Not only did Colorado kill the penalty, but Arizona spent most of their power play getting stood up at the blue-line. Johansson made two nice saves to keep the game tied.

Soon after the penalty was killed, there was a hit on Brandon Saad at mid-ice that cause him to skate gingerly to the bench. Thankfully, Saad would return later in the period. Then the Avalanche would go right back on the penalty kill, with Renouf taking a tripping call.

Colorado would kill off the Renouf penalty as well, looking to head to intermission tied after an ugly period with lots of hitting and pucks pinned into corners. MacKinnon would have other ideas, scoring from the high slot with less than 12 seconds left in the frame.

The tally would be number 200 for the Avalanche’s super-star center and bring the period to an end with Colorado up a goal on the scoreboard. The Coyotes would out-shoot the Avalanche this period 11-10.

Third Period

The final frame of the contest started off with a lot of neutral zone action until Garland put the Avalanche on the power play three minutes into the period. While the Colorado power play would generate a few chances, Arizona kills off the penalty. This would prove to spark the Coyotes, as they would score back-to-back goals within a minute and ten seconds of each other.

Johansson doesn’t cover himself in glory on either goal, but the Avalanche defense could’ve done a much better job controlling the rebounds given up, especially on the Phil Kessel goal.

Arizona played much better in the third period and forced the Avalanche to spend a lot of time in their defensive zone for the middle ten minutes of the third. Colorado would get a break from all of the pressure at 3:47 left in the game when Johan Larsson high-sticks Jacob MacDonald to put Colorado on a late power play. Unfortunately, the Avalanche power play cannot convert. A strong shift from the Jost line would generate a couple more chances before the end of regulation, but none find the net. Overtime it is.

Overtime

The Avalanche start with a nice chance created by Nichushkin and MacKinnon, but the refs blow a quick whistle while the puck is still loose to deny the scoring chance for Colorado. A turnover after the ensuing faceoff would lead to a Kessel breakaway on Johansson, but the newest Avalanche goaltender makes his best save of the night to deny Kessel.

A slash on Schmaltz would give the Avalanche a golden opportunity to end overtime, but Hill also saved his best of the night to keep the game going. Colorado was relentless throughout the power play, but Hill was up to the task and this game would be decided by a shoot out. It would be the first shoot out of the season for Colorado.

The Coyotes would score with all three of their shootout attempts to take the victory. Joonas Donskoi would score with his attempt, but MacKinnon would sail his shot high and wide to send Colorado into their day off with a single point.

Takeaways

Colorado came out flat tonight and paid for it, giving up two goals on their first three shots. It was looking an awful lot like the Anaheim game where Hunter Miska was pulled after a period, but Johansson settled down and performed decently. The Avalanche goaltender made a few key stops down the stretch and got little help from his defense on three of the four Arizona goals.

As much as nobody wants to talk about the refs after a game, tonight it is unavoidable. Even if you take away the missed call on the Chychrun/MacKinnon event, the referees missed multiple penalties against the Avalanche tonight. With the two big events occurring tonight (the Nashville “makeup” call and the MacKinnon incident) in the NHL, the league is going to have to answer for their referees after tonight. While the referees generally don’t win or lose games for teams; tonight they had an outsized impact on the game that could’ve ended with multiple players injured on both sides.

Makar and Toews had a rough night at the back end tonight, combining for a minus-five rating. The second Arizona goal in particular looked bad for the pair. Makar looked a step slower than usual tonight, although playing a team high 26:32 is a likely factor. With coach Jared Bednar only trusting Renouf to be on the ice for a little over seven minutes; Girard, Makar and Toews all played over 24 minutes. These three have all been playing huge minutes and tomorrow’s day off should do them well. Hopefully, the day off will also allow Byram to return to the lineup for a huge upcoming series against Vegas.

Upcoming

The Avalanche (20-8-3; 43 points) will be off tomorrow and return to Ball Arena to take on the Vegas Golden Knights (22-7-1; 45 points). It looks to be a key series and a bit of a measuring stick for both teams as they sit atop the Honda West division. Grubauer will likely return to start both games of the set against the Golden Knights and Marc-Andre Fleury.

Arizona (14-14-5; 33 points) will be off two days before they take on the San Jose Sharks (12-14-4; 28 points) on Friday at the Gila River Arena."

Nathan MacKinnon will be in the lineup this evening when the Colorado Avalanche opens a back-to-back against the Anaheim Ducks at Ball Arena.

Matt Calvert was on the ice with the group in a red, non-contact jersey today after missing the past four games with an upper-body injury, and head coach Jared Bednar said the forward could return to game action as soon as tomorrow.

Colorado will use the same six defensemen as it did in its previous two games with Bowen Byram and Cale Makar each out with upper-body injuries. Head coach Jared Bednar said Byram is progressing and skated with Calvert before the group began the practice. Bednar also noted that Makar is also improving and is still day-to-day, but the rear guard is not expected to play in the next few games.

Bednar did not have an update on defenseman Erik Johnson (upper body) or goaltender Pavel Francouz (lower body) but did say that prospect Dennis Gilbert was in the building this morning and is beginning off-ice workouts after having surgery a few weeks ago following an upper-body injury.

Philipp Grubauer was the first goaltender off the ice from morning skate and is expected to start in net for the Avs for the 18th time this season. He shares the league lead with three shutouts, matching his career high, and is tied for third in wins (11).

Tonight's contest opens a nine-game homestand for Colorado. The homestay, which runs from March 5-20, is the longest continuous homestand in Avalanche history.

It is also the beginning of the fourth back-to-back set for the Avs, who swept a back-to-back at the Arizona Coyotes last weekend. The team is 2-1-0 in the first night when playing on consecutive days and 2-0-1 in the second.

Nichushkin circled around a defender and then slid a shot past John Gibson for the winner. The 6-foot-4 forward was mobbed by teammates in the corner.

“That was a beautiful goal,” said teammate Brandon Saad, who had a goal and two assists. “He was sharp tonight. Anytime he uses his big body and his speed, he’s tough to handle.”

Nichushkin and Saad helped pick up the scoring slack with Colorado missing star player Nathan MacKinnon, who was a late scratch. MacKinnon left in the third period Wednesday in San Jose after taking a hit to the head.

“This afternoon, [MacKinnon] came down and wasn’t feeling good, so the protocol says he can’t play and we’re not going to put him out there and risk him getting hurt or something, or making it worse,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar explained. “I don’t know what that means as far as tomorrow or the next day, but I’m assuming he’s going to miss a couple games here.”

With Colorado trailing 2-0 in the second period, Nichushkin and Saad scored 2:37 apart to even things up. Both of their goals were in front of Gibson, who stopped 31 shots.

“We started off a little slow. It was a good bounce-back character win,“ Saad said. “That definitely gets you feeling good in the right direction.”

Adam Henrique and Jakob Silfverberg scored for the Ducks (6-12-6), who dropped to 0-6-3 over their last nine. The Ducks haven’t won since beating Vegas on Feb. 11.

“We’re doing a lot of good stuff,“ Silfverberg said. “It’s just the last little bit that it takes to get two points in this league. Unfortunately, we’ve been on the wrong end of it a few too many here lately.”

Both of the goals that beat Grubauer were on wrist shots, including one by Silfverberg after he skated from end-to-end.

Henrique staked the Ducks to a 1-0 lead on a nifty wrist shot with 9.4 seconds remaining in the first period.

Nazem Kadri had a first-period goal disallowed after he batted in a puck once it caromed off the glass. The officials took a long look on replay before determining Kadri’s stick was above the crossbar when he made contact.

Colorado (13-7-1) began a nine-game home stretch, which is the longest continuous homestand in Avalanche history. The team did have a nine-game homestand in 2002, but that included an Olympic break.

“Just hanging out at home and sleeping in your own bed and not having to travel, obviously, that pays dividends,” Kadri said.

It will also be the busiest month in Avalanche history with 17 games in 31 days.

Colorado captain Gabriel Landeskog and his wife, Melissa, recently welcomed a baby boy. The couple also have a daughter.

Bednar believed the two-game suspension issued to San Jose forward Joachim Blichfeld for his hit on MacKinnon was a fair punishment.

“He doesn’t do any of the things that sometimes players do when it’s a predatory hit,” Bednar explained. “I don’t think it was intentional.”

Ducks defenseman Josh Manson (oblique muscle injury) returned to the lineup for the first time since Jan. 18.

“I thought he played excellent,“ Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. “This is a tough building to come in and return to after being out that long. The air is thin. You feel it just walking up the stairs here.”

Avalanche defenseman Dan Renouf had an assist for his first career NHL point. Defensemen Cale Makar and Bowen Byram are day-to-day with upper-body injuries. Defenseman Dennis Gilbert was added to the league’s COVID-19 protocol list. He was already out after surgery on his face.

I was at the Avalanche’s game at Arizona on Feb. 27, when 3,224 mostly Avs fans made it feel like the real thing.","think, end, variance, stands, avalanche, air, nhl, colorado, avs, teams, fans, ball, arena, chambers",avalanche,geophysical event,"A little more than half of the teams in the NHL (16-of-31) are allowing fans in their arena or plan on doing so this month.

The Avalanche is currently not one of them. But count Jared Bednar among those hoping the Avs join the club with limited fans inside Ball Arena before its club-record nine-game homestand ends March 20.

The Avs head coach mentioned that desire multiple times last week without being directly asked about it.

“Love to see some fans get in the stands here like some of the other teams are doing,” Bednar said Friday.

Kroenke Sports & Entertainment is trying. But the company that owns Ball Arena, the Avalanche and the Nuggets doesn’t have the final say.

In a KSE statement released at the end of February, the company said it is “unable to submit this type of variance request for fans due to the fact that Denver County remains at Level Yellow on the Colorado Covid Dial, which precludes the Colorado Department of Health & Environment (CDPHE) from issuing games with fans variance for indoor venues. KSE and CDPHE have had continued ongoing discussions regarding a variance request for fans at Ball Arena for this basketball and hockey season.”

There is hope for blue skies ahead. Jefferson County moved from yellow to blue late last month. If Denver County follows, we might hear more than just fake fan noise at Ball Arena.

I was at the Avalanche’s game at Arizona on Feb. 27, when 3,224 mostly Avs fans made it feel like the real thing. Colorado forwards Gabe Landeskog and Tyson Jost both said it was loud and felt like a regular game.

It would be nice to get back to the real thing, obviously, and the Avs surely hope the COVID dial turns left and fans return to Ball Arena before the record-long homestand ends. The Avs also have four home games at the end of the month to conclude a stretch of 13-of-15 games at Ball Arena.

Make no mistake, there can be a significant home-ice advantage with limited fans. And because of the strict COVID travel protocol, playing at home is a much better experience than on the road.

Unlike previous years, NHL teams don’t have much away from home. They have to be alone in their hotel rooms and all meals are order-in or a team meal in a secure room at the hotel.

“This is a big one for us,” Bednar said of the homestand. “I think it’s nice because I feel like we have a little more freedom at home to not just be in a hotel room and then go straight to the rink. You can be with family and kind of get your minds off hockey a little bit and stay refreshed mentally.”

Plus-minus confusion. Avalanche center Nazem Kadri logged a season-high 22:14 in Friday’s 3-2 win over Anaheim, after moving up to the first line in place of the injured Nathan MacKinnon.

Kadri made a great play on a disallowed goal, created multiple other scoring chances and, behind Valeri Nichushkin (two goals) and Brandon Saad (goal, two assists), was among the few Colorado forwards that had a great game.

Yet, he was zero in plus-minus and remained a team-worst minus-12 for the season. Only six other NHL players have a worse plus-minus, and they each play for a sub-.500 team.

“I honestly think plus-minus is a deceiving stat, but at the end of the day you want to score more than you get scored on,” Kadri told me.

Avs defenseman Ryan Graves led the NHL with a plus-4 rating last season. This year, he is minus-4.

“Sometimes you just catch bad breaks,” Kadri said. “Honestly, I think you’ve been playing well and you step on the ice for a few bad breaks and they end up in the back of your net.”

Kadri is a solid player. Let’s keep it at that."
26,2021-03-01 00:00:00,"Satellites, airplanes and lasers are tracking Colorado avalanches",https://coloradosun.com/2021/03/01/satellites-colorado-avalanches-airborne-snow-observatory/,"The Colorado Avalanche Information Center has been testing satellite imagery to detect avalanches.
When a slide was detected it was automatically reported to Norwegian avalanche forecasters.
Despite the low utility of radar in Colorado to date, satellites are still in the mix at CAIC.
“We can pick out avalanches from that cycle pretty well with, you know, 90% confidence that we’re picking out avalanches,” Cooperstein said.
In Colorado, field-based avalanche detection and forecasting — in which avalanche forecasters scour the mountains on snowmobiles and skis in search of the most unstable snowpack — aren’t going away any time soon.","satellites, avalanches, forecasters, lasers, radar, method, tracking, avalanche, airplanes, colorado, snow, deems, satellite",avalanche,geophysical event,"Avalanche forecasting has come a long way since the 1950s, when forecasters relied solely on weather to predict when and where snow might slide. But it still requires scientists skiing and digging into the snowpack. That’s changing as satellites, aircraft-mounted sensors and ground-based remote monitoring fast-track the evolution of snow science, giving experts comprehensive insight into the uncanny nature of avalanches.

The Colorado Avalanche Information Center has been testing satellite imagery to detect avalanches. The technology is building a more accurate library of avalanche activity over a winter season, and year over year. And not just for the most trafficked zones, said Mike “Coop” Cooperstein, the center’s lead forecaster for the northern mountains.

“We have really good information along the highways, in the really popular recreation spots — Berthoud Pass, Loveland Pass, Red Mountain Pass. But it’s pretty close to the road,” Cooperstein said. “So we wanted to look into those deeper areas, a few miles from the trailhead, and see what’s happening, because we are forecasting for those areas.”

With 11 avalanche fatalities in Colorado this winter, and 32 nationwide, avalanche forecasters like those at CAIC need all the resources they can get to create accurate forecasts for backcountry regions. But methods of gathering good information are decades old. Emerging technologies may help, but it could be years before they are operational or affordable enough for avalanche forecast centers to use on a daily basis.

Relying on observations shared by travelers on roads and skintracks yields only a partial picture of avalanche activity, and doesn’t necessarily reflect the hazard spread across entire ranges. As a result, during any given avalanche cycle, forecasters may miss part of the avalanche activity because it wasn’t witnessed, and wouldn’t be able to warn their audience of backcountry goers. The other issue is not being able to verify whether their forecast was correct after the fact, making it difficult to identify patterns of inaccuracy and improve forecasts over time.

An avalanche record biased toward easy-to-access areas also leaves researchers in the lurch as they have only a fuzzy quantitative idea of what “normal” is as far as avalanches go. This could complicate understanding how avalanche activity shifts away from historical trends because of climate changes.

To balance and fill in the record, researchers, avalanche forecast centers and private companies are leaning on new technologies.

Late last year, Norway began using satellite-mounted radar to detect avalanches across the country.

The system was developed by a team from the Norwegian Research Center, known as NORCE, using synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, mounted on the European Space Agency’s two Sentinel-1 satellites. When a slide was detected it was automatically reported to Norwegian avalanche forecasters. Because the SAR device emits microwaves toward the Earth’s surface, rather than sensing natural light, this method allows the satellites to capture images on cloudy days or at night.

When an avalanche releases, the debris pile left at the slope’s base is both rougher and more dense than the surrounding snow, which scatters the microwaves emitted by the SAR so that fewer of them return to the sensor on the satellite. The NORCE team has built what’s called a data processing chain that recognizes this increased “backscatter” and flags it as potential avalanche debris.

The method is not perfect — with accuracy varying on how much water is in the snowpack — but technology is helping the Norwegian avalanche forecasting agency identify thousands more avalanches than any field-based efforts would, said Markus Eckerstorfer, the NORCE researcher who developed the data processing chain.

“In general, the method is very promising,” Eckerstorfer said. “It’s probably better than anything else. If you have a certain region, you could never cover the entire region as you do with a satellite. But you’re still not able to detect everything.”

In 2018, Eckerstorfer received funding from the ESA to test the method in Colorado, teaming up with CAIC. But the test fell flat.

Colorado’s mid-latitude played a role in the poor results: Because the Sentinel-1 satellites are polar-orbiting, moving between the North and South poles, the closer a region is to the equator, the less coverage it receives. Norway, being so far north, receives daily passes, while Colorado is passed every six or so days. Additionally, during the winter of 2018 one of the pair of satellites stopped sending images of Colorado because it needed time to recharge for imaging Europe and countries that paid to put the constellation into orbit.

An image every 12 days was far less useful for CAIC, and interest in the project dropped off.

“We wanted to have pretty close — a day or two at the most — of detection so that we can, after our forecast, look and see if what we think happened, happened,” Cooperstein said. “For that, there just isn’t enough coverage. There aren’t enough passes over Colorado to do that kind of work right now.”

Research using the method continues elsewhere in the states, though, which may one day come back to benefit Colorado.

An avalanche forecasting center in Idaho and another in Montana are using a rudimentary version of NORCE’s automated avalanche detection from Sentinel-1s, led by Zach Keskinen, a snow science master’s candidate at Montana State University.

Keskinen said the technology would not replace forecasters on skis, but it can be yet another tool in the high-consequence science of predicting avalanches.

“It’s starting to show promise to where [an avalanche forecaster] could say, ‘Hey, this is where you should go for your field day.’” he said. “Hopefully it will help to guide field days for forecasters and just make their field time more powerful.

Keskinen expects satellite coverage in the states to improve. The U.S.-Indian NISAR satellite scheduled for launch in 2022, will have SAR sensors.

Despite the low utility of radar in Colorado to date, satellites are still in the mix at CAIC. The organization is using optical imagery instead of radar to review the once-in-a-century avalanche cycle from March 2019, when historic slides swept over Interstate 70, blew out massive swaths of forest and spiked four of Colorado’s avalanche advisory zones into “extreme” avalanche danger.

“We can pick out avalanches from that cycle pretty well with, you know, 90% confidence that we’re picking out avalanches,” Cooperstein said.

CAIC staff can look at destruction of vegetation, or signatures of decaying vegetation, to see where an avalanche has cleared forest, documenting slides that may otherwise have been missed.

“The thing there is it takes such a large avalanche to destroy trees,” Cooperstein said. “That avalanche cycle, I’ll probably never see another one of those in my career, that’s that big. But [optical satellite imagery] has really good promise and we have pretty good results from doing that.”

Lasers can detect avalanches, too, specifically light detection and ranging, or LiDAR.

Jeffrey Deems, a researcher at University of Colorado and co-founder of Airborne Snow Observatory (an offshoot of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory), uses LiDAR mounted on aircraft to measure snow in basins across the western U.S. While the goal of these flights is to map how much snow—and therefore water—a river basin holds so that water managers can better plan how to allocate runoff, they also detect avalanches.

The method works by “mowing the lawn,” as Deems puts it, flying a plane with a LiDAR instrument scanning every foot of an entire river basin. Such a flight path is done in the summer without snow to create a baseline, then again in the winter, allowing Airborne Snow Observatories to subtract the summer image from the winter one to determine snow depth.

In 2019, flights in the Upper Gunnison and Roaring Fork river basins revealed large avalanches that had not been documented. LiDAR offers a more detailed look into an avalanche than other optical or radar imagery.

“With the LiDAR technology, we can actually see the change in snow depth, so we can actually get a better metric, or a better understanding of the volume of snow that had to move, rather than just mapping the extent of it,” Deems said.

Deems, with colleagues from the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab, operate ground-based LiDAR on Loveland Pass and Arapahoe Basin ski area as well, where the fixed sensors allow managers to measure every 10 centimeters of new snow and even slab thickness after a storm.

Private companies are supplying high-resolution satellite imagery as well, albeit with a price tag that’s beyond the budget of most avalanche forecasting centers.

Planet, one of the largest private satellite imagery companies, employs more than 130 satellites to provide clients with 3- to 5-meter resolution images, according to the company’s website. Clients can choose what geographic region they want covered, at what frequency — up to multiple times a day — and for how long a period.

Such rich data would no doubt benefit mapping avalanches and filling out the avalanche record, Cooperstein said, adding that the cost of such services are becoming more affordable.

In Colorado, field-based avalanche detection and forecasting — in which avalanche forecasters scour the mountains on snowmobiles and skis in search of the most unstable snowpack — aren’t going away any time soon. While these technologies are exciting, most aren’t operational, or simply cost too much for widespread use in Colorado’s diverse and wide-ranging backcountry.

“LiDAR and radar and camera technologies from ground-based or drone-based platforms, I think we’ll see those in increasing use for ski areas and highway departments who need real-time feedback on evolving conditions and the success of avalanche mitigation,” Deems said.

But the need for more avalanche-detection methods that are consistent from mountain range to mountain range and state to state remains if scientists and practitioners hope to better connect weather dynamics to avalanche activity, Deems added.

It may be key to planning for the future as well. Most mountain areas lack data-based projections of how climate will affect avalanche activity, because avalanche datasets are full of big holes, Eckerstorfer, the NORCE researcher, said. The sooner these datasets are filled in, the sooner plans can be formed to mitigate avalanches in a changing climate.

“If you live in a mountain environment, you need to start preparing now for what’s to come in a couple of decades,” Eckerstorfer said.

Unfortunately the same problems the Avalanche saw last week returned and resulted in another 6-2 beating this time at the hands of a Sharks team who has been enduring their own struggles.

The Game

A sloppy first period for both teams still saw the Avalanche lead the shot advantage 11-7 and then they finally would convert near the end of the frame for a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes. After a second failed power play for both teams Sam Girard took matters into his own hands and scored at 18:32 a minute after he rang a shot off the post on the man advantage. The goal came two seconds after the power play, in which Girard also drew the penalty, had expired.

The second period began with some power play success, this time with Gabe Landeskog executing a perfect backhand at 4:21. Some nice passing and movement forced the Sharks into a tight box and the Avalanche just picked their spot. The game appeared to be in control at this point but there was over half a game yet to play.

The momentum quickly turned as the Sharks took advantage of poor coverage from the fourth line and Radim Simek cut the lead in half at 6:13. The game opened up for the rest of the period with both teams trading chances but it was the Sharks who evened the score from Kevin Labanc at 16:48 after he was lost in front of the net. Despite the miscues this game was still tied 2-2 heading into the final period.

Just one goal from the Avalanche would have stopped the bleeding but it never came. Instead the Sharks sensed fear in their opponent and took control quickly. The Sharks proceeded to score four unanswered from Rudolfs Balcers, Erik Karlsson, John Leonard and Evander Kane on an own goal, the power play, a breakaway and an empty net goal respectively. While the game was wide open as the Avalanche became desperate any danger they had earlier in the game was wiped away and resulted in a pathetic 6-2 loss.

Takeaways

The defensive breakdowns will get the attention in the aftermath of this game and deservedly so however the offensive impotence caused the situation to begin with. The first goal was scored at even strength technically two seconds after a power play had expired but beyond that the Avalanche generated little at 5v5. The excuses of a hot goaltender or key injuries at forward were not present for this game and it’s time to face the fact that somehow this team cannot erase a deficit with all the scoring talent they possess.

That all said about the offense, the defensive performance must be addressed. While everyone on the ice can share the blame from this game but JT Compher and Nazem Kadri continue to find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time in multiple times a game in the middle of defensive breakdowns and each had a starring role on key goals against in this one. Bowen Byram was surprisingly ruled out with an upper body injury just before the game began which did not help matters on an already taxed defensive core.

It is time to start taking the standings seriously with a third of the season now in the books. It was cute to ride on the “favorites” and “contender” status but the reality is this team hasn’t earned those labels. The condensed schedule with multiple games against the same teams tend towards a split anyway, add in the fact that each night sees multiple division games go to overtime and the result is it is very difficult to make up any ground or separation among the other West teams. The Avalanche are in danger of falling out of a playoff spot with games in hand rapidly evaporating.
