These states are -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Haryana.

Few other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, also witnessed unusual deaths of poultry, crows and migratory birds, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying said in an official statement on Thursday.

The Centre has asked local authorities to boost surveillance around water bodies, live bird markets, zoos and poultry farms.

Meanwhile, Delhi's Husbandry department has been put on a high alert due to the increasing number of bird flu cases in the neighbouring states.

So far, there are no cases of its transmission into humans, as per reports. The human-to-human transfer of avian influenza is 'very rare' and it has no connection with the novel coronavirus.

However, those working in the poultry farms should take necessary precautions like wearing PPE kits while working in the farm.

The current bird flu outbreak comes barely a few months after India on 30 September last year declared the country free from the disease.

Let's take a look at the current infection scenario in India:

Kerala - A three-member Central Government team visited Kerala on Thursday to assess the situation arising out of the bird flu outbreak in the Alappuzha and Kottayam districts of the state.

In Kerala, as many as 50,935 birds have been culled to stop the spread of the bird flu. This is in addition to the 25,000 odd birds that had died due to the bird flu outbreak in the state.

Himachal Pradesh - In the state's Pong wildlife sanctuary, around 381 more migratory birds were found dead, taking the death toll of the birds from the avian influenza to 3,409.

Odisha - The Odisha government has asked people to not panic over the incident as the avian influenza virus test came negative in all five selected samples. The Fisheries and Animal Resource Development Department in a statement said that people can consume chicken meat, eggs and other poultry products produced in the state after properly cooking them.

Haryana - The state Animal Husband and Dairying department has sent three samples to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal after the intervention of the Centre. Samples from two were found positive for H5N8 (avian influenza), JP Dalal, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Fisheries Minister of Haryana, said.

Rajasthan - Deaths of over 170 new birds were reported from some districts in the state recently, taking the total fatalities to over 425.

Jammu and Kashmir - 150 crows were found dead in Jaganoo area of Udhampur district, Jammu and Kashmir amid the bird flu outbreak. Samples of dead crows have been sent for testing to detect if they died from the bird flu.

In the wake of several reports of poultry, crows, migratory bird deaths, the Centre has established a central Control room to strategise, co-ordinate and facilitate state governments with regard to outbreak management, disease control and containment.

Moreover, two central teams have been deployed to visit the affected states of Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring and for epidemiological investigation.

The avian flu must be stopped before sustained transmission among humans

Just three months after India declared itself to be free of the avian influenza outbreak , the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtypes, H5N1 and H5N8, have been reported from a dozen epicentres in four States — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. In addition, thousands of poultry birds have died in Haryana, while Jharkhand and Gujarat, too, have sounded an alarm; the cause in these three States is still unknown. The two subtypes have targeted different birds — crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh, and poultry in Kerala. While tests have confirmed H5N1 for causing the deaths of over 2,000 migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh , H5N8 has been identified for killing thousands of poultry in Kerala, and hundreds of crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In a bid to stop the spread, as on Wednesday over 69,000 birds, including ducks and chickens, were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam as per India’s 2015 National Avian Influenza Plan . Other States have been asked to be vigilant of any unusual deaths or disease outbreak signs amongst birds, particularly migratory ones. Migratory birds have been largely responsible for long-distance transmission of the virus into India during winter. It then spreads through local movement of residential birds and poultry. Movement of men and material from poultry farms too has been a cause for further spread. This is why States have been asked to strengthen biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfection and proper disposal of dead birds. With backyard rearing of poultry birds common, the task of elimination will be particularly difficult.

A recent European Food Safety Authority report says 561 avian influenza detections were made between August-December in 15 European countries and the U.K. The virus was predominantly found in wild birds, and a few in poultry and captive birds. H5N1 and H5N8 were two of three subtypes found in Europe. Genetic analysis helped confirm the spread from Asia to west-central Europe, suggesting a “persistent circulation of this virus strain, likely in wild birds in Asia”. While avian influenza virus crossing the species barrier and directly infecting humans happens occasionally, human-to-human spread has been rare. But mutations or genetic reassortment of an avian influenza A virus and a human influenza A virus in a person can create a new influenza A virus that could likely result in sustained transmission between humans, thus increasing the risk of a pandemic influenza. Hence, all efforts should be directed at stamping out the outbreaks in the affected States. It is also important to undertake genome sequencing of virus samples to track the evolution of the virus."

Several states, which have been reporting deaths of birds, including crows and migratory species, are scrambling to have samples tested for the virus.

As anxiety spreads, there is fear of a fresh blow to the poultry industry — reports have been coming in of people giving up chicken and eggs, and of prices falling.

The infection

Bird flu or avian influenza is the name used to describe a viral infection that is reported mostly in birds, but has the potential to affect humans and other animals. The most common strain of the virus that causes severe respiratory disease in birds is H5N1; various other strains like H7, H8 too, cause infection.

The virus was first reported in geese in China in 1996. Since then, outbreaks have been reported periodically across the world. India reported the presence of the virus in Nandurbar, Maharashtra, in 2006, which led to large-scale culling of poultry birds.

Samples from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala have tested positive for the A (H5N8) strain of the virus, while samples from Himachal Pradesh have shown the presence of A (H5N1).

Human transmission

The H5N1 virus can jump species and infect humans from the infected bird. The first case of H5N1 infection in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997, when a poultry farm worker caught the infection from infected birds.

The high mortality rate in humans — almost 60 per cent — is the main cause of concern about the spread of bird flu. In its present form, human-to-human infection is not known — human infections have been reported only among people who have handled infected birds or carcasses.

How common is it?

Between 2006 and December 31, 2018, India reported 225 epicenters of bird flu infection, which led to the culling of 83.49 lakh birds, with farmers being paid Rs 26.37 crore in compensation.

Interestingly, Maharashtra which was the first state to report the infection, has not seen an outbreak since 2006. Odisha, Tripura, and West Bengal are among the states that have reported repeated outbreaks of the infection in both domesticated and wild birds.

This time, most infections have been reported either in wild birds, crows or migratory birds, Dr A S Ranade, Dean, Bombay Veterinary College, said. Since 2006, the poultry industry has developed bio safety zones around farms, which has stopped commercially reared birds from coming in contact with any foreign feed or bird, Dr Ranade said.

Poultry meat, eggs

Dr Ranade pointed out that the chances of the H5N1 virus infecting humans is comparatively low in India as compared to South East Asian countries, mainly because of the difference in culinary habits.

“The virus dies immediately if exposed to temperatures over 70 degrees Celsius. Unlike in South East Asian countries, both meat and eggs in India are eaten well cooked, which sees them being exposed to over 100 degrees Celsius. Thus the chances of humans contracting the virus from eating chicken and eggs is extremely rare,” he said.

India consumes 30 crore poultry birds and 900 crore eggs per month on average.

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the poultry industry suffered a body blow after unsubstantiated rumours linked the spread of the disease with consumption of chicken and eggs. Within a span of two months, the industry suffered losses of around $ 1 billion, as people kept away from eggs and poultry meat. While the industry has managed to get back on its feet, production remains low.

“Four cranes were found dead in the Delhi zoo a few days ago.

All the 12 samples have tested negative, he said.

Last week, samples from a dead owl in the Delhi zoo had tested positive for avian influenza. Zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said they were following all protocols and monitoring the situation strictly.

‘We have been using the ebird mobile application to keep track of the birds in the premises of the zoo,’ he said. This is the first time the application is being used for bird monitoring and record keeping during the outbreak of avian influenza.

The application allows the user to enter sightings from anywhere in the world, even in areas with no cell service, or Internet access.

Singh said that 1,338 bird deaths have been reported in Delhi between January 6 and January 21 amid the bird flu situation.

Of the 207 samples collected from various places in the national capital, 24 have tested positive for avian influenza so far, he said.

One iteration of the claim (here) points to a graph from the World Health Organization (WHO). It reports the “number of specimens positive for influenza by subtype” in the UK for each week of 2020.

The graph shows that around the start of April, a few weeks after the UK first went into lockdown, influenza rates dropped to minimal levels.

Unlike previous years, where flu activity would drop in summer and then rise again winter, in 2020 it has remained consistently low since April.

This has caused some users to believe that cases of the flu are being mislabeled as COVID-19, leaving comments like: “That’s because they’ve used flu numbers and turned them into covid” and “flu eradicated or covid is flu rebranded ?”.

However, there is a reasonable explanation for why flu activity has remained low during the pandemic.

“Influenza and Corona viruses infect the lungs following inhalation of environmental droplets”, Tracy Hussell, Professor of Inflammatory Disease at Manchester University, told Reuters via email.

“Since they use a similar transmission route, the measures currently being taken to slow the development of severe COVID-19 disease (social distancing and mask wearing) are likely responsible for the reduction in influenza virus infection in the current 2020/2021 season”.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that this also happened in the United States, when “influenza virus circulation declined sharply within 2 weeks of the COVID-19 emergency declaration and widespread implementation of community mitigation measures, including school closures, social distancing, and mask wearing” (here).

Another contributing factor could be that millions more people in the UK were offered the flu jab this year (here).

The expanded flu vaccination programme was created to relieve pressure on the NHS during the pandemic.

Influenza viruses cause the flu, while a type of coronavirus leads to COVID-19. Reuters has previously reported that the specific nature of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19 make them highly unlikely to give a false positive in someone with flu (here).

VERDICT

False. Low flu levels during the pandemic are likely the result of coronavirus measures such as mask wearing and social distancing, not because it has been mislabeled as COVID-19.

In Haryana, around one lakh poultry birds have died mysteriously in the last few days.

In Himachal Pradesh’s Pong Dam Lake, around 1,800 migratory birds have been found dead. In Kerala, the flu has been detected in two districts, prompting authorities to order culling of ducks. A bird flu alert has been sounded in Rajasthan, where more than 250 crows were found dead in half a dozen districts.

What is avian influenza or bird flu?

It is a highly contagious viral disease caused by Influenza Type A viruses which generally affects poultry birds such as chickens and turkeys. There are many strains of the virus – some of them are mild and may merely cause a low egg production or other mild symptoms among chickens, while others are severe and lethal.

How does the bird flu spread?

Wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese are the natural reservoir of Influenza A viruses and the central players in the ecology of these viruses.

Many birds carry the flu without developing sickness, and shed it in their droppings. Since birds excrete even while flying, they provide “a nice aerosol of influenza virus, shedding it all over the world”, in the words of American virology professor Vincent Racaniello.

From water birds, many of whom migrate and travel long distances, the viruses are thus further spread to poultry and terrestrial birds. Sometimes, the virus jumps over to mammals such as pigs, horses, cats and dogs.

When and how did the bird flu start infecting humans?

Bird flu outbreaks have been affecting poultry around the globe for decades, and culling of infected birds has been a common measure to contain the spread. But it was in 1997 when humans are first known to have contracted bird flu following an outbreak in a live bird market of Hong Kong. It was the H5N1 strain of the virus, and 6 out of 18 infected humans died of the disease.

It was contained, but re-emerged a few years later in various other parts of the globe and caused hundreds of human deaths, particularly in Southeast Asia. Movement of infected poultry and migratory birds, and an illegal bird trade are believed to be the causes of the spread. Some mammals such as cats and lions were also infected.

Subsequently, several other strains of the virus such as H5N2 and H9N2 spread from animals to humans, thus becoming a global public health concern.

Does it spread easily to humans?

No, it does not. Generally, people coming in close contact with infected alive or dead birds have contracted the H5N1 bird flu, and it does not usually spread from person to person, as per the WHO. There is also no evidence, the WHO says, that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and cooked poultry food. The virus is sensitive to heat, and dies in cooking temperatures.

Then why the scare?

H5N1 is severe and deadly – around 6 out of 10 confirmed cases in humans have led to deaths (though the actual mortality rate may be lower due to under-reporting of asymptomatic cases).

If the virus mutates and becomes easily transmissible from person to person, say by altering its shape to grab human cells much more effectively, it can potentially cause a pandemic.

Also, flu viruses are more prone to mutation because they have a segmented genome. All known strains of flu – including the seasonal flu and the pandemic flu – have jumped from birds to humans in this way.

Bird flu in India

In India, no case of bird flu in humans has been detected so far, according to the Union health ministry. The department of animal husbandry has reported 25 episodes of H5N1 bird flu in poultry in 15 states from 2006 (when the first outbreak occurred in Maharashtra and Gujarat) till 2015. It has also been detected in crows.

Bird flu: What are its symptoms and treatment?

Unlike in birds, where it generally infects the gut, the avian influenza attacks the respiratory tract of humans and may cause severe respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Its early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

Antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir, improve the prospects of survival in humans, according to the Union health ministry. The ministry advises people working with poultry to use PPEs and follow hand hygiene. In the US, the FDA approved a vaccine for the H5N1 virus in 2007.

Among poultry birds, vaccination strategies advised by the World Organisation for Animal Health can be used to prevent the flu, and the Organisation recommends eradicating the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at its source to decrease the disease in avian species and further human infections."

During a typical flu season, the number of people getting the flu would just be starting to rise, with the peak typically coming in February. Yet so far, only 0.2% of 400,000 swabs for the flu have been positive, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same time last year, the positivity rate was 13%.

With hospitals across the country near or at capacity with Covid-19 patients – about 132,000 people are currently hospitalized with Covid – flu’s minimal presence is a blessing. At least 38 million Americans had the virus during the 2019-20 season. While the flu is less deadly than Covid-19, it has the potential to strain the healthcare system during a bad year. Last year, 400,000 people were hospitalized with the flu and 22,000 died from it.

“Covid is causing an incredible stress on the healthcare system in many parts of the country,” said Dr William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. “Even if we had a mild to average [flu] season, we would all be swamped at the moment.”

Instead, “we’re having, to date, a profoundly mild influenza season,” Schaffner said.

Multiple factors have played a role in dampening the flu this season.

The virus usually makes its way to the northern hemisphere after spreading in the southern hemisphere, which experiences its flu season from June to August. But the 2020 flu season in the south was virtually non-existent.

Public health experts believed that measures in the southern hemisphere to prevent the spread of Covid-19 also worked to stop the spread of the flu. Though the flu is also a respiratory virus, it is not as transmissible as Covid-19, so mask-wearing and social distancing are more effective at disrupting flu spread than the spread of Covid-19. The low number of cases, paired with the decrease in travel between the northern and southern hemisphere, boded well for the flu season in the north.

Still, Americans were urged to get the flu vaccine to decrease the chances of a feared “twindemic” of flu and Covid-19. More than 192m doses of the flu vaccine were distributed throughout the US by the end of December, according to the CDC, the highest number of doses distributed in a single flu season.

It appears the bulk of those doses have been used. More adults in the US got the vaccine this season compared with years past, according to the CDC. About 53% of adults have received the flu vaccines. Around the same time last year, 42% of adults had been vaccinated while 48% were vaccinated by the end of the last flu season.

Schaffner said schools undertaking measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 – extensive cleaning, masks and social distancing and holding classes virtually – probably also played a key role in stopping the flu’s spread. Children shed the flu virus more than adults do and for longer periods of time, making it easy to spread to family members and teachers who can spread it to other adults.

“Children have been much more isolated, so this distribution mechanism has been effectively shut down,” he said.

While there is much to celebrate about the low flu numbers, the US is not out of the woods yet: there is still a chance the virus could see a surge, especially since millions of Americans traveled over the holidays.

But Schaffner said there was cautious optimism that the US had avoided the worst of a “twindemic”.

“We continue to be very alert to that possibility, but so far, I think we’re on a record-setting pace for a low flu season.”

During the same period this flu season, the agency reported 1,016 cases.
Though many experts are relieved to see public health measures working against flu spread, they said the numbers speak volumes about the transmissibility of COVID-19.
As of Dec. 25, more than 192 million doses of flu vaccine had been distributed, “which is the highest number of doses distributed in the U.S. in a single flu season,” the CDC's Grusich said.
Rehm said Americans were especially motivated to get a flu vaccine last year as health experts warned hospitals could be overwhelmed by flu and COVID-19 patients in a “twindemic” scenario.","cases, vaccine, forgiving, season, coronavirus, symptoms, rehm, vaccinated, public, flu, health, say, low, contagious, influenza, record, covid19, experts",Influenza,pandemic,"As COVID-19 raged last year, the seasonal flu all but vanished, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

During the 2019 flu season from Sept. 29 to Dec. 28, the CDC reported more than 65,000 cases of influenza nationwide. During the same period this flu season, the agency reported 1,016 cases.

Health experts said that high vaccination rates against the flu – combined with social distancing, mask-wearing and hand-washing employed to stop the spread of the coronavirus – played a huge role in preventing influenza transmission.

The drop occurred despite a sixfold increase in testing at public health labs, most of which checked for influenza A and B along with the coronavirus.

Clinical lab testing was slightly lower during the last quarter of 2020 as physicians ordered fewer flu tests because less of the illness was circulating.

“The public health labs test for more surveillance purposes rather than patient care reasons and are therefore a better measure of influenza burden each season than clinical labs,” CDC spokesperson Kate Grusich told USA TODAY.

Though many experts are relieved to see public health measures working against flu spread, they said the numbers speak volumes about the transmissibility of COVID-19.

“It says that it’s more contagious and that it’s less forgiving of any lapses of these types of prevention measures,” said Dr. David Hooper, chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Hooper said one reason the coronavirus is more transmissible is because people can shed the coronavirus days before exhibiting any symptoms, if they develop symptoms at all.

Fact check:COVID-19 is far worse than the influenza outbreaks of 1976, as meme claims

COVID-19 vaccines:Biden plans to release available vaccines instead of holding back for second doses

A model developed by CDC researchers and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open found that people who don’t show symptoms may be responsible for 59% of COVID-19 transmissions, comprising 35% who are pre-symptomatic and 24% who never develop symptoms.

People generally don't shed flu virus for more than a day before symptoms appear, Hooper said.

Dr. Susan Rehm, vice chair at the Cleveland Clinic’s department of infectious diseases, said another reason flu incidences are low is because most people have some innate immunity from prior vaccinations and infections.

“COVID is a novel infection caused by the SARS coronavirus, and no one has any innate immunity to it,” she said. “So the population is probably overall more susceptible to it than maybe to influenza.”

It helps that Americans vaccinated against the flu at record numbers last year compared with previous seasons, Rehm said.

As of Dec. 25, more than 192 million doses of flu vaccine had been distributed, “which is the highest number of doses distributed in the U.S. in a single flu season,” the CDC's Grusich said. Flu vaccine manufacturers project they will provide as many as 194 to 198 million doses to the U.S. market by the end of the season, which could last as late as May, according to the CDC.

Rehm said Americans were especially motivated to get a flu vaccine last year as health experts warned hospitals could be overwhelmed by flu and COVID-19 patients in a “twindemic” scenario.

“A lot of people in the past haven’t felt that flu was very severe and thus haven’t necessarily felt so motivated to get vaccinated,” she said. “Certainly, COVID has taught us that respiratory illnesses can be extremely severe.”

Though the news about flu is good, Rehm cautioned the season is not over.

“Just because it’s been low so far doesn’t prove that it’s going to be low going forward, and getting vaccinated is the best thing you can do to prevent influenza,” she said. “It’s not too late to get vaccinated for influenza.""

The vaccine’s effectiveness also depends on correct predictions about which strains will be most common in a given season.

For these reasons, a one-and-done universal vaccine that would provide lasting immunity over multiple flu seasons and protect against a variety of strains has been a long-term goal for scientists.

Researchers are now one step closer to hitting that target. Scientists recently completed the first human trial of a vaccine created by recombinant genetic technology to fool the immune system into attacking a part of the virus that does not change so fast and is common among different strains.

I am a microbiologist interested in infectious diseases, and I’ve followed the seasonal flu epidemic for several years. I’m excited by this news, which could mark the turning point in the quest for a universal flu vaccine. Here’s how it all works.

Biology of the invading influenza virus

Like the virus that causes COVID-19, the influenza virus has a protein shell that is coated by a lipid membrane. Sticking through the membrane are multiple copies of three types of proteins: haemagglutinin, abbreviated as HA; neuraminidase, abbreviated as NA; and the matrix protein, M2.

It’s the properties of the HA and NA proteins that distinguish the different strains of the virus. You’ve probably heard of strains like H1N1 and H3N2, both of which are infecting people in the U.S. this year.

The HA molecule is shaped a bit like a flower bud, with a stalk and a head. Once someone inhales the virus, the tip of the HA molecule’s head binds to a receptor on the surface of the cells that line the person’s respiratory passages.

This initial binding is crucial as it induces the cell to engulf the virus. Once inside, the virus gets to work replicating its own genetic material. But the enzyme that copies its single-strand RNA is very sloppy; it can leave two or three mistakes, called mutations, in every new copy.

Sometimes the genetic changes are so drastic that the progeny viruses don’t survive; other times they are the start of new flu strains. Based on viral samples collected from around the world, the flu virus that arrives one year will have about seven new mutations in the gene for HA and four in the gene for NA compared to the previous year’s virus. These differences are a big part of why the same influenza vaccine won’t be as effective from one year to the next.

Fighting off a flu infection

When infected with the flu virus, your immune system produces antibodies to fend it off. Most of these antibodies interact with the HA head and prevent the virus from getting into your cells.

But there’s a downside to that strong reaction. Because the immune response to the virus’s head is so vigorous, it pays little attention to other parts of the virus. That means that your immune system is not prepared to fend off any future infection with a virus that has a different HA head, even if the rest of the virus is identical.

Current flu vaccines are inactivated versions of the influenza virus and so also work by inducing antibodies targeted to the HA head. And that’s why each version of the vaccine usually works only against a particular strain. But, as the flu spreads, the rapid rate of genetic change can produce new versions of the HA head that will evade the antibodies induced by the vaccine. These newly resistant viruses will then render even the current season’s vaccine ineffective.

The stalk portion of the HA molecule is much more genetically stable than the head. And HA stalks from different flu strains are much more alike than their head regions are.

So, an obvious way to protect people against different flu strains would be to use just the HA stalk in a vaccine. Unfortunately vaccination with only a headless stalk doesn’t seem to prevent infection.

Scientists are currently pursuing several different solutions to this problem.

A new kind of flu vaccine

A team of scientists led by Florian Krammer at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai just completed the first human clinical trial of what they hope will be a universal flu vaccine.

The researchers used recombinant genetic technology to create flu viruses with “chimeric” HA proteins – essentially a patchwork quilt built from pieces of different flu strains.

Volunteers for the clinical trial received two vaccinations separated by three months. The first dose consisted of an inactivated H1N1 virus with its original HA stalk but the head portion from a bird influenza virus. Vaccination with this virus induced a mild antibody response to the foreign head, and a robust response to the stalk. This pattern meant that the immune systems of the subjects had never encountered the head before, but had seen the stalk from previous flu vaccinations or infections.

The second vaccination consisted of the same H1N1 virus but with an HA head from a different bird virus. This dose elicited, again, a mild antibody response to the new head, but a further boost in response to the HA stalk. After each vaccine dose the subjects’ stalk antibody concentrations averaged about eight times higher than their initial levels.

Researchers found that even though the vaccine was based on the HA stalk of the H1N1 virus strain, the antibodies it elicited reacted to HA stalks from other strains too. In lab tests, the antibodies from vaccinated volunteers attacked the H2N2 virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic and the H9N2 virus that the CDC considers to be of concern for future outbreaks. The antibodies did not react to the stalk of the more distantly related H3 viral strain.

The antibody response also lasted a long time; after a year and a half, the volunteers still had about four times the concentration of antibodies to the HA stalk in their blood as when the trial started.

Since this was a phase 1 clinical trial testing only for adverse effects (which were minimal), the researchers didn’t expose vaccinated people to the flu to test if their new antibodies protected them.

However, they did inject the subjects’ blood serum, which contains the antibodies, into mice to see if it would protect them against the flu virus. Getting a shot of serum taken from volunteers a month after receiving the booster shot, when antibody levels were high, led to mice being 95% healthier after virus exposure than mice who got blood serum from nonvaccinated volunteers. Even the mice who received serum that was collected from vaccinated volunteers a year after the start of the trial were about 30% less sick.

These results show that vaccination with a chimeric flu protein can provide long-lasting immunity to several different strains of the influenza virus. Scientists will need to continue optimizing this approach so it works for different types and strains of influenza. But the success of this first human trial means you may one day get a single shot and, at last, be free from the flu.

The flu season is far from over — it usually begins in the fall, and peaks between December and February.
It’s the reason he thinks the incredibly low flu activity during the coronavirus crisis won’t be repeated in the years to come.
I think we may see much more of that and more cautious behavior during influenza season,” Schaffner noted.
The main message is to get a flu shot in the fall, and still get one now if you haven't already in case flu activity picks up in the coming weeks.","masks, maskwearing, historic, flu, 20202021, lows, virus, activity, schaffner, influenza, wearing, social, season, dr",Influenza,pandemic,"As the world focuses on COVID-19, influenza — that other contagious respiratory illness caused by a virus — seems to have all but disappeared.

Flu activity is “unusually low” for this time of year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest weekly U.S. influenza surveillance report.

“The CDC is being modest — influenza is at record-setting lows,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, told TODAY.

“The flu virus is not circulating in our population the way it normally does.”

He and his colleagues have been conducting flu surveillance since the 1990s and have never seen illness levels close to this low, Schaffner noted.

Flu activity is “significantly down,” added Dr. Nisa Maruthur, a primary care physician and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Some 136 people were hospitalized for the flu between Oct. 1, 2020, and Jan. 16, 2021, and there were 292 deaths involving influenza during that period, the CDC reported. One child has died.

The flu season is far from over — it usually begins in the fall, and peaks between December and February.

But in comparison, 400,000 people were hospitalized for the flu and 22,000 died, including 434 children, during the entire 2019–2020 season, which the CDC described as “severe” for kids 4 years old and younger, and for adults 18-49 years old.

The flu activity maps look very different for the same week in January 2020, compared to 2021, with most states reporting minimal activity this year:

CDC

In 2020, high or very high flu activity dominated the map:

CDC

The change is not surprising since the flu virus spreads through respiratory droplets, similar to the new coronavirus, and people are wearing masks, social distancing and paying attention to hand hygiene to avoid COVID-19, said Dr. Waleed Javaid, director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York.

“Fewer people are out and about, and people are even hopefully less likely to be out if they are symptomatic,” Maruthur added. “In normal years, people who are symptomatic do not typically feel the same need to stay home.”

But the major contributor has to do with children, who are usually “the great distribution engine” for the flu, Schaffner noted. Kids are very contagious because they make more influenza virus than adults and they shed it for longer periods of time.

But during the coronavirus epidemic, many children are either learning from home, or wearing masks and social distancing at school.

“Children are not getting infected and not bringing the virus home to their elders,” Schaffner said.

It’s the reason he thinks the incredibly low flu activity during the coronavirus crisis won’t be repeated in the years to come.

Still, mask-wearing could outlast the epidemic, especially since it has become familiar to people in the last year, Javaid said

“Would it be a best practice in winter seasons to wear a mask? I am inclined to say yes,” he noted. “I think we should seriously consider using masks to reduce the intensity of flu seasons.”

That could lessen flu hospitalizations and deaths in years to come, but there won’t be an impact if only a few Americans keep wearing masks and social distancing in future flu seasons, the experts said.

Some people are already declaring they’ll keep the mask habit given that they haven’t had the sniffles or any other cold and flu symptoms since the coronavirus started.

I haven’t had a cold or even sniffles in a year. I’m going to keep wearing a mask in crowds and on planes even after I get vaccinated. They WORK. — Susan Orlean (@susanorlean) January 24, 2021

Other lessons learned are that physical distancing, getting the flu shot and staying home if you are symptomatic are also very effective, Maruthur added. More than 193 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed​ as of mid-January, the CDC said.

“We're all used to seeing people wear masks now — no big deal. I think we may see much more of that and more cautious behavior during influenza season,” Schaffner noted.

“Wear your masks, social distance — do those sorts of things on an annual basis. I think we'll see much more of that messaging because it's now more socially acceptable and familiar to many people.”

Does a lighter-than-normal flu season so far this year mean the next one will be more problematic? Flu is ""very quirky"" so there's no way to predict what will happen in 2022, said NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres. The main message is to get a flu shot in the fall, and still get one now if you haven't already in case flu activity picks up in the coming weeks."

But new research from the University of Georgia shows that state laws promoting flu vaccinations for hospital workers can substantially reduce the number of influenza-related deaths.

Spanning 23 years, the study looked at the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia during peak flu season (from December through March of each year), comparing changes in mortality over time in the 13 states and Washington, D.C., that adopted laws to the changes in mortality in states without laws. All states that passed laws require the flu vaccines to be offered to hospital employees. Eleven took it a step further by mandating that workers be vaccinated or required documentation of refusal, with three requiring unvaccinated employees to wear surgical masks during flu season.

The findings align with previous research suggesting that hospital workers may serve as vectors of disease transmission within their hospitals and even in their communities. States that mandated hospital workers receive flu shots saw the biggest reduction in mortality from flu and pneumonia. On average, the adoption of a law promoting vaccination reduced mortality by about two deaths per 100,000 persons, with the reductions primarily occurring among older adult populations.

""The elderly are extremely vulnerable to influenza and are also generally less responsive to the vaccine,"" said Emily Lawler, corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor in UGA's School of Public and International Affairs. ""This study suggests that vaccinating hospital workers against influenza reduces influenza disease transmission and helps protect this vulnerable population.""

A federal mandate requiring hospital workers to get an annual flu shot would likely further reduce influenza-related deaths.

This study did not closely examine why some health care workers refuse vaccines. However, if the COVID-19 vaccines are proven to prevent disease transmission -- so far they've only been proven to protect the vaccinated individual from disease -- then vaccinating hospital workers could be integral to dramatically reducing transmission of COVID-19 and mortality in communities across the country.

""Stricter policies result in higher vaccination rates among health care workers,"" Lawler said. ""Our results are consistent with the idea that these stronger laws result in a larger reduction in influenza-related mortality.""

Mandatory vaccinations don't come without some controversy, though. In some cases, health care workers refuse to get vaccinated. It's an issue with the flu shot, which varies in efficacy each year due the limitation of vaccine developers only being able to include several strains of the virus in a given shot. But it's also occurring with the new COVID-19 vaccines at a surprisingly high rate among health care professionals, nursing home workers and other frontline personnel.

Over the past few weeks, cases of bird flu have been reported from various states across the South Asian nation, posing a new challenge to authorities.

Officials in several states have stepped up efforts to contain two strains of bird flu — H5N1 and H5N8 — in recent days after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens.

Addressing the issue at a virtual meeting held with state governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""Poultry farms, zoos, water bodies have to be constantly monitored to control the spread of bird flu."" He stressed that authorities have put together a plan to tackle the emergency.

The spread of avian influenza has been confirmed in more than ten states so far, including Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Delhi and Maharashtra. States that haven't reported cases have also been asked to exercise caution.

Samples from dead birds are being studied at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), in the central city of Bhopal.

Spread through migratory birds

Officials first detected the H5N8 strain of the virus in January after dead fowl and wild birds were found in several parts of the country.

Most of the dead were Central Asian high-altitude bar-headed geese — one of the world's highest-flying birds — that migrate to South Asia during the winter season.

The H5N8 subtype has spread to different parts of the world since early last year. It has also affected several countries in Europe, including France, where thousands of chicken and other poultry have been culled.

India too has announced the culling of poultry and wild geese. Officials said the flu has spread in India mainly through migratory birds. The virus can spread to cats, dogs and other mammals as well.

India has witnessed bouts of devastating bird flu outbreaks in recent decades, most seriously in 2008, when millions of poultry were culled.

Severe economic impact

The fear of the virus has hit several cities across the country, leading to plummeting prices and sales of chicken, eggs and other fowl. Poultry sales have dropped even in states that have no reported cases of the disease.

While New Delhi announced a ban on the import of live birds, poultry chickens are being culled in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh and ducks in Kerala. Markets and shops selling poultry have been shut for a week in seven Madhya Pradesh cities and the Uttar Pradesh government has announced a temporary closure of the biggest wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur city.

""We are the ones who are at risk, those dealing with birds on a daily basis. Now, very few people are coming to buy poultry products. This has affected our earnings. Thankfully, people are still buying lamb, so we aren't left high and dry. But if this continues for a long time, we will suffer,"" said Ashfaq, a meat shop owner in the national capital region.

India's minister for animal husbandry, Giriraj Singh, said that it was safe to consume eggs and chicken that have been cooked up to 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit). According to the World Health Organization, the virus does not spread from person to person, and cannot survive at high temperatures.

The first outbreak of bird flu was reported in India in 2006, in the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Subsequently, other states too reported cases of the flu. But there were no cases of human infection. India had previously declared itself free of bird flu in September 2019."

Avian influenza continues to take a heavy toll on India’s poultry sector. Thus far, the disease has spread in 11 states. Besides chickens, other species of birds, including ducks, crows and pigeons, have also been found dead. Recently, officials reported that a brown fish owl in the Delhi zoo had tested positive for the disease.

While the virus’s rate of transmission between different species of birds is in itself alarming, people are also becoming more apprehensive about the pathogen’s spread to humans, via poultry meat and eggs. This in turn is affecting the poultry industry in a big way.

Avian influenza or bird flu is caused by type A influenza viruses. There are various subtypes of the virus. Those belonging to subtype H5 are grouped under the “highly pathogenic avian influenza” category, causing up to 100% mortality in birds. So far, two subtypes – H5N1 and H5N8 – have been detected in the current outbreak.

Aquatic birds are natural hosts of avian influenza viruses. Many of them are migratory, which could explain why the virus has spilled over to so many other species of birds.

To date, scientists have not documented a single H5N8 infection in humans. However, between 2003 and 2020, officials have reported 862 human cases of H5N1 infections to the WHO. In most cases, researchers have attributed infections to contact with infected live or dead poultry.

This said, the consumption of poultry meat and eggs is not considered to be the principal source of transmission. Studies have noted that H5N1 viruses spread from poultry to humans primarily by contact with respiratory secretions, faeces, blood and the organs of infected birds.

People at increased risk for avian influenza virus exposure are farmworkers, butchers, veterinarians and others who work in proximity to infected birds. The majority of human exposure risk occurs at the farm and in the processing steps.

Though there have been instances when avian influenza viruses have crossed the species barrier and infected humans, there exists no convincing evidence for human to human transmission of the virus. Similarly, there is no data to prove that human beings can contract the virus simply by consuming infected meat. (There have been stray reports of human cases of H5N1 infection after drinking raw duck blood in Vietnam.)

It’s essential to follow certain safety practices while consuming poultry products. The avian influenza virus is sensitive to heat. So cooking at 70º C (‘piping hot’) will certainly kill the virus. If a thermometer is not available, it is advisable to cook the meat until it is no longer pink.

Avian influenza viruses can survive freezing and refrigeration. In fact, low temperatures increase the virus’s stability, so the act of freezing fresh meat alone won’t eliminate the virus.

According to the WHO, people handling raw poultry products should thoroughly wash their hands with soap and warm water, and disinfect the working space.

Eggs laid by infected birds harbour the virus inside as well as on the surface of the eggshell. The risk associated with egg consumption is naturally mitigated to a certain extent because birds infected with highly pathogenic influenza viruses tend to stop laying eggs. Nonetheless, as a precaution, it is not advisable to consume raw eggs; they have to be fully cooked, at least until the egg yolk is no longer runny. This egg pasteurisation process completely inactivates the virus.

It’s important to remember that a certain degree of risk is associated with preparing infected poultry products for eating. Chopping and cutting could generate aerosols that spray up infective materials into mucous membranes. That is, the bigger challenges vis-a-vis poultry products have to do with preparation, not consumption. Chefs and cooks need to take special care in this regard.

Speculation about chicken meat consumption was rife in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. However, the coronavirus that has been affecting chickens for decades belongs to an entirely different genus – not to the one to which the novel coronavirus belongs. Experts are also fairly certain that chickens don’t harbour the novel coronavirus. Thus, there is no possibility for transmission of coronavirus from chickens to humans.

But in the case of the bird flu, based on previous reports, we can’t yet rule out the virus’s transmission from poultry to humans. At the same time, there is no clear-cut evidence that humans could get avian influenza by consuming infected poultry products. So while it is important to be cautious while preparing poultry meat and eggs, just cooking them properly will eliminate the risk.

It can help explain why there are so few flu cases so far, experts say.
The researchers said “awareness regarding measures to reduce the risk of [COVID-19] transmission,” could have affected the spread of influenza.

But health care professionals aren’t seeing their standard influenza-ridden patients this season, suggesting the virus isn’t making its usual rounds in the northern hemisphere.

“We are testing thousands of people in our emergency room settings and in our hospitals for a combination of COVID and flu, and we’re essentially seeing no flu,” Dr. Randy Bergen, a flu expert with health care company Kaiser Permanente, told ABC7. “Some weeks we’ll have no cases, others we’ll have maybe one or two.”

Health officials in the southern hemisphere — including Australia and South America, where the seasons are reversed — said their flu season was virtually nonexistent while coronavirus cases were spreading like wildfire.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says national flu activity “remains lower than usual,” including flu-related hospitalizations, but there’s still time for it to increase in the coming months.

Since Sept. 27, there have been a little over 1,000 influenza cases reported in the U.S., the latest CDC data shows, but an agency spokesperson told McClatchy News in an email that reported clinical and public health positive flu cases aren’t “necessarily an accurate number.”

That’s because “flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested,” the spokesperson said.

The agency usually provides estimates on the number of illnesses, doctor’s visits, hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu, “but because there isn’t much activity, we haven’t been able to generate [them],” they added.

For comparison, the CDC estimated that there were 38 million flu cases, 405,000 flu hospitalizations and 22,000 flu deaths during the 2019-2020 season, which began in the fall and ended in spring.

Meanwhile, infectious diseases experts say it’s hard to pinpoint why so few people are catching the flu amid a pandemic involving a similar respiratory virus.

They speculate that flu vaccinations, coronavirus priority in health care systems, competition between viruses and COVID-19 preventive measures such as mask wearing and social distancing all play a role in the abnormally inactive 2020-2021 flu season.

We can prevent the flu better than COVID-19

The coronavirus appears to spread more easily than the flu because it typically takes more time before people show COVID-19 symptoms — if they show them at all — which makes them contagious for longer, according to the CDC.

The flu is more preventable than COVID-19, as well, thanks to annual vaccines designed to target whatever version of the influenza virus that’s spreading in a given year.

About 189 million flu vaccinations were given in the U.S. as of Dec. 4, a CDC report says. That’s the highest number of flu doses distributed to Americans during a single influenza season.

It can help explain why there are so few flu cases so far, experts say.

“Either virus can make you very sick or lead to death, but with influenza we have the opportunity to focus on prevention because we have additional tools in our arsenal that help decrease overall infections,” Dr. Allison Bartlett, an infectious diseases expert with UChicago Medicine, wrote..

COVID-19 prevention strategies may also prevent flu spread

Health experts say preventive measures for COVID-19 — such as mask wearing, social distancing, working from home and closing schools — might be making a dent in the spread of other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu.

The CDC says children in school usually play large roles in spreading influenza, but “the effectiveness of school closures alone is not clear because adults have other exposures.”

There is evidence, however, that supports the use of masks by infected people to reduce the spread of any respiratory virus in the health care setting, in homes and in the general community, the CDC says.

Researchers in Taiwan compared 25 weeks of data on the flu, Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and pneumonia deaths from 2016 to 2020 and found that all three illnesses spread less in 2020 than the same weeks in the previous years.

The downward trend was particularly apparent when the country enforced COVID-19 preventive measures, the study found.

A separate paper from Japan came to similar conclusions after discovering that flu activity was lower week-by-week in 2020 compared to the last five years. The researchers said “awareness regarding measures to reduce the risk of [COVID-19] transmission,” could have affected the spread of influenza.

Border closures blocking international travel to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also likely helped prevent the spread of the flu, experts say.

Flu patients may not be visiting hospitals, getting tested

After the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national emergency on March 1, the nation’s influenza activity “declined sharply within two weeks... although the exact timing varied by location,” the CDC report says.

Dr. Brendan Flannery, co-author of a letter calling for organized testing for both influenza and COVID-19, said the worst-case scenario is that people suspected of having the flu have been staying home, not getting tested and avoiding seeking care because medical centers have been overwhelmed with coronavirus patients.

That could explain why the number of patient samples submitted for flu testing dropped by 61%, while the number of positive test results plunged by 98% following the nation’s first lockdowns, according to the CDC.

Competition between coronavirus and influenza?

Experts say there’s no biological reason why someone can’t be infected with both coronavirus and influenza, however it’s unknown if having had COVID-19 makes you less likely to get the flu, or vice versa.

“Unfortunately, there is no antibody level cross protection from flu and COVID-19. Your ability to fight off one is independent of the other,” Bartlett of UChicago said.

But there is the possibility that coronavirus and influenza are battling to win over hosts, given they both attack the respiratory system.

“Now whether it’s immunity or they just suppress the growth of another virus, it’s not really clear, but there’s certainly an inkling from a couple of years ago, that viruses can compete,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told ABC7.

The CDC report also mentions “viral interference.”

“Viral interference might help explain the lack of influenza during a pandemic caused by another respiratory virus that might outcompete influenza in the respiratory tract,” the reports reads. “This possibility is less likely in the U.S. because influenza activity was already decreasing before [coronavirus] community transmission was widespread in most parts of the nation.”"

In midst of COVID-19, US sees ‘unusually low’ flu activity

According to the CDC, influenza activity this season has been “unusually low,” with rates of hospitalization as of late January that were similar to 2011-2012 — the least severe season in the past decade.

According to experts, preventive measures to control COVID-19 transmission are the reason why.

Paul D. Biddinger, MD, director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, said flu almost went away and almost overnight after COVID-19 mitigation measures were put in place last year.

“COVID-19 prevention measures have had a profound impact in the United States and globally, interrupting transmission of influenza and many other respiratory viruses while COVID-19 continues to spread quite successfully,” Jeffrey S. Duchin, MD, health officer and chief of the communicable disease epidemiology and immunization section for the Seattle and King County, Washington, public health department, and a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, told Infectious Disease News.

The impact was apparent in the U.S. during the early months of the pandemic, when there was a sharp decline in respiratory specimens that tested positive for influenza, followed by “historically low interseasonal levels,” according to a report in MMWR by Sonja J. Olsen, PhD, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s Influenza Division, and colleagues, which was based on data from around 300 U.S. laboratories. They also analyzed data from Australia, Chile and South Africa and identified just 51 positive influenza results among more than 83,000 specimens, demonstrating a similar effect in the Southern Hemisphere.

Infectious Disease News compiled existing influenza data and spoke with experts to discuss the impact that COVID-19 has had on this influenza season and what it could mean for next season and beyond.

In a typical influenza season, the U.S. still sees a “substantial amount of flu” into March and April. However, during the 2019-2020 season, influenza was “essentially gone” by the end of March, said Paul D. Biddinger, MD, director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

“What we saw was that there was moderate flu activity as COVID-19 started to present in the community and then relatively quickly, as people began masking and physical distancing and as there were restrictions on people’s interactions, flu almost went away — and almost overnight,” Biddinger told Infectious Disease News.

The trend has continued. In the week ending Jan. 23, for example, only one state — Oklahoma — reported influenza activity above what the CDC considers “minimal.” Just 1.3% of patient visits reported that week were for influenza-like illness — far below the national baseline of 2.6% — and the percentage had not climbed higher than 1.6% all season. Last year, it peaked at around 7%.

Additionally, of the more than 266,000 specimens tested by public health laboratories since September, only 179 have been positive for influenza.

“We normally start to see flu — at least a little bit — in November and December, and by January, we see significant flu. Here in New England, we have seen almost no flu,” explained Biddinger, who said his hospital is actively testing every patient admitted for both COVID-19 and influenza.

In October, experts warned about the potential for what Infectious Disease News Editorial Board Member William Schaffner, MD, called a “double-barreled respiratory virus season” — COVID-19 and influenza circulating at high levels at the same time.

It has not materialized.

William Schaffner

“The current influenza season is by far the mildest in recent memory,” Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), told Infectious Disease News. “Thank goodness that the anticipated ‘twindemic’ has not yet appeared as COVID-19 alone is straining health care resources.”

Tim Uyeki, MD, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Influenza Division, told Infectious Disease News that it is too early to make conclusions “other than, to date, influenza activity has been very low throughout the U.S.”

“We have experienced late influenza seasons in the U.S. and we have seen over the past several months that when some countries reduced COVID-19 control measures, such as in some Southeast and South Asian countries, influenza activity increased.”

Still, experts said the as-yet low level of transmission is likely a combination of behavioral changes made as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and a successful influenza vaccine, although complete data on vaccine efficacy was not yet available.

Among the measures that are likely having an impact to reduce influenza transmission are social distancing and mask wearing, experts agreed. Schaffner added another factor — the switch from in-person to virtual schooling.

“My favorite theory relates to what is happening in schools,” he said. “Children are thought to be the most effective disseminators of influenza viruses in our population because they shed large amounts of virus for considerable periods. Since COVID-19, there has been much home-schooling, and even when children have attended school in person, social distancing and mask wearing are often the norm.”

There are indications that other respiratory viral infections have also declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a 16-week period from April through July at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut, for example, Michael Parry, MD, chair of infectious diseases at Stamford Health and professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and colleagues reported that only one case of influenza and three positive BioFire tests — which are used for diagnosing all other respiratory infections — were recorded in 2020, compared with an average of 138 combined cases per season over the past 5 years.

The study also demonstrated that the proportions of positive BioFire and influenza tests were significantly lower, with only 1.4% of BioFire tests positive in the 2020 season compared with 38.9% in previous seasons, despite an increase in the volume of testing. Only 1.3% of influenza tests were positive in 2020 compared with 10.8% of tests performed during the historical seasons.

“We think that the systematic use of masking, hand hygiene, social distancing and stay-at-home policies can dramatically reduce the risk of all viral respiratory tract infections, including influenza,” Parry told Infectious Disease News after the study was published.

Experts speculated that, given the drastic reduction in respiratory illnesses, some measures may be kept in place.

“I think this is going to make us rethink and consider the use of community mitigation measures — and particularly face mask wearing — to prevent influenza and other respiratory viruses in the fall and winter months, and maybe even early spring,” Uyeki said. “If most people with influenza who are transmissible are those who are symptomatic, you can actually control that by having them stay at home, wearing face masks and having other people around them wearing face masks as well, combined with annual influenza vaccination. These strategies might be especially important for persons at high risk for influenza complications.”

Schaffner said it “seems sensible” that future public health recommendations to protect against influenza could include mask wearing and social distancing, “particularly for those at increased risk of complications and severe disease.”

“I think it’s logical to assume that masking, physical distancing and other restrictions have played a big role in decreasing the flu season,” Biddinger said. “But as with everything in medicine, I think we probably will need more data to know for sure and see if there’s anything about COVID-19 itself that could have played a role.”

Record vaccine deliveries

According to Biddinger, fewer than half of eligible adults are vaccinated against influenza every year.

“Everyone is very appropriately focused on COVID-19 vaccination, but one thing I would love to see — something that is very simple and easy to do and doesn’t require anyone to change how they see their friends or how they live their lives — is flu vaccination,” he said.

Most influenza vaccines are still manufactured using eggs, but there are other technologies that can produce vaccines faster, which would be a benefit if the U.S. experiences a late increase in influenza, said Tim Uyeki, MD.

As of Jan. 15, more than 193 million doses of the influenza vaccine had been shipped in the U.S., according to a new influenza vaccination tracker sourced by the CDC. This is the highest number of doses distributed during a single influenza season in history, according to the CDC.

The tracker showed that more adults have been vaccinated in 2020-2021 than last season, although vaccination rates among certain groups — including non-Hispanic Black adults and children — have appeared to drop off.

Overall, the CDC estimates that 53% to 54% of people were vaccinated against influenza by December — higher than the previous season’s coverage estimates for adults, which were 42% by the end of December 2019 and 48% by the end of May 2020.

“This year we saw record numbers of patients and residents getting vaccinated,” Biddinger said. “I think people really didn’t want to have any sort of febrile illness, especially in the time of COVID-19.”

In early October, the NFID and CDC hosted an annual influenza and pneumococcal news conference to discuss new data on attitudes toward influenza and vaccination. Data from a survey showed that despite increasing vaccination rates and particularly deadly influenza seasons in recent years, including the severe 2017-2018 season, only 59% of U.S. adults said they intended to get vaccinated, even though 68% said they believed vaccination is the best protection against influenza.

“I think we may be challenged a little bit, maybe as we are every year with getting people to take flu seriously. Every year, we have to remind people that 20,000 to 50,000 people die each year from influenza and that a substantial portion of that is vaccine preventable,” Biddinger said. “If you get your flu vaccine, you’re less likely to have to go to the hospital, you’re less likely to have symptoms that make you wonder if its COVID-19. These are really, really strong arguments we hope to make again this fall.”

According to the survey, the top reasons cited for not getting vaccinated were not believing influenza vaccines work (34%), concerns over adverse effects from the vaccine (29%) and concern about getting influenza from the vaccine (22%). Additionally, 32% cited never getting influenza as their reason.

“I would love to think that people might see this positive experience of high rates of influenza vaccination and low rates of influenza and better health, but I think that’s going to depend on a lot of us trying to emphasize that point next year when we head into flu season,” Biddinger said.

Next season

Decreased activity this season raises questions about what next season will look like. There could be a severe combined influenza and COVID-19 season “given the lack of influenza exposure this season and the likelihood of continued circulation of COVID-19,” Duchin said.

“I think we understand so little about the seasonality of influenza and how it moves that it’s hard to predict how quickly flu will rebound,” Biddinger added. “We probably have a lot of reasons to expect it will, just because it has, over the decades and over the century, been such a prominent feature every winter in human health.”

One potential concern Uyeki mentioned is that there has hardly been any circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses in the U.S. during the 2019-2020 and current season, and therefore, waning immunity could result in a severe influenza season if A(H3N2) viruses were to circulate widely. He noted that seasons predominated by A(H3N2) viruses are typically more severe, particularly for elderly persons in whom influenza vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses is suboptimal.

Another challenge created by the reduced activity is the selection of viruses for next season’s vaccines, Uyeki said.

“We’re identifying far fewer influ­enza viruses than a typical season, and so we just have a lower number of samples of viruses to be able to make predictions on what influenza virus strains might be circulating next season,” he said. “This really complicates the process, but I want to highlight that it is a global process” involving WHO reference laboratories all over the world, including the CDC’s Influenza Division, which is the WHO reference center for North America.

According to Uyeki, it is possible that influenza activity could still pick up over the coming weeks and months.

“One of the issues is, if we have a later influenza season, this will further complicate efforts to provide viruses to make recommendations for virus strains to manufacturers, so that they will be able to produce influenza vaccines for next season,” Uyeki said.

Most influenza vaccines are still manufactured using eggs, but there are other technologies that can produce vaccines in a much shorter time, including tissue cell culture-derived viruses and recombinant DNA vaccine technology, Uyeki said.

“Both of those ... don’t take as long to produce influenza vaccine, so they might be able to respond better if we have a later season, but this will certainly complicate efforts to select the vaccine strains for next season’s vaccine,” he said.

Public Health England has not recorded a single case of the virus so far this year through routine surveillance tests, despite it being the height of the usual flu season.

But this doesn't mean it has been completely wiped out, health bosses say.

Yet officials are confident flu is barely spreading because only four people admitted to hospitals in England since the start of year were confirmed to have had the virus.

For comparison, 74 patients were admitted with flu during the same week at the start of 2020 — before Covid had taken hold.

However, the figures suggesting flu has been annihilated are from a snapshot of just 25 NHS trusts. Data for the other 100-plus hospitals are not included in the weekly surveillance reports.

Dr Vanessa Saliba, of PHE, said social distancing, face coverings and hand washing had sparked the sharp drop in influenza infections.

'The decrease in flu cases this year is likely due to changes in our behaviour, such as social distancing, face coverings and handwashing, as well as the reduction in international travel,' she told the Independent.

Some critics claim flu cases haven't vanished at all but are instead being recorded as Covid because they both have similar symptoms.

Sceptics say tests are unable to distinguish between coronavirus and flu — but scientists insist there is no chance of mistaking one for the other through routine swabs.

But it was revealed at the start of the pandemic that some care home deaths were being blamed on Covid, even if the victim had not tested positive.

Public Health England was yet to record a single case of influenza this year by February 14. But experts cautioned this doesn't mean the virus has completely disappeared, because the agency only sequences samples that it receives from NHS hospitals and as part of surveillance programmes

The lack of cases recorded through the official swabbing scheme by February 14 does not necessarily mean influenza is not in circulation.

PHE usually only checks samples sent to it by the NHS, which was overwhelmed with Covid patients.

The Office for National Statistics has also continued to record deaths linked to the virus this year.

PHE detects flu cases in hospitals by screening swab tests from NHS patients so doctors can better treat them if they know they have flu.

BRITONS COULD GET COVID VACCINE IN A PILL, SAYS EXPERT Britons could get their Covid vaccine in the form of a pill in the future, according to the lead scientist behind Oxford University's jab. Professor Sarah Gilbert told MPs today her team were focusing their efforts on new, injection-free ways to deliver the vaccine and stimulate a better immune response. The group are exploring delivering the jab using nasal sprays, in the same way the flu jab is given to children, or in tablet form, used in polio vaccination. Not only would it be great news for people who have a fear of needles, it could help alleviate supply issues that have hindered rollouts internationally. Professor Gilbert said using pills or nasal sprays may better target immune cells in the lungs, throat and nose, making them even more effective. Advertisement

But it usually only carries this out for critically ill patients, and surveillance programmes examining the spread of the virus.

PHE admitted in its own report that all indicators show influenza is spreading at low levels but warned there is now 'limited testing' for viruses that aren't Covid.

Dr Saliba added that cases were also low because of the flu vaccine – which more than 15million people in England got last year.

'[This] helps protect them from the flu and also stops them spreading it to others,' she said.

'This season's immunisation programme is on track to be the most successful ever, with the highest levels of vaccine uptake recorded for those 65 years and over, two and three-year-olds and healthcare workers.'

81 per cent of over-65s have had the vaccine this year, along with around half of high-risk younger people and pregnant women, and a third of middle-aged people who were in an expanded group for 2020.

Experts have said the sharp decline in flu infections suggests that the virus could be kept in check every year with some of the measures used to stop Covid, which may remain in use after the pandemic.

NHS hospitals usually see a mass influx of flu patients every winter, but this year they failed to materialise.

Lockdowns have been imposed to bring down Covid-19 cases in the community and relieve intense pressure on healthcare services.

Studies and official data show coronavirus is significantly deadlier than flu for older people, but may be similar for the young.

No10 is currently carrying out a mass vaccination programme against Covid to allow life to return to normal, with the aim of freedom by June 21.

Boris Johnson has outlined his 'four-stage' ticket to freedom from restrictions, saying this has only been made possible by immunity from jabs.

The plan will see schools be the first to open on March 8, followed by friends and families being allowed to meet with one other in parks on March 24.

Officials will wait five weeks between relaxing each level to ensure it does not trigger any spikes in Covid infections."

Noam Galai/Getty Images Flu season has been mild this year, thanks to the mitigation measures used to contain COVID-19 , such as physical distancing and mask wearing.

School and office closures also contributed to the unusually inactive flu season.

The mitigation measures curbed influenza activity even though COVID-19 surged. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Last summer, infectious disease specialists warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could spiral into a “twindemic” when seasonal influenza hit. But that nightmare scenario never unfolded. The flu didn’t get a strong footing in the United States this season and a twindemic never struck. COVID-19 is likely far more contagious than the flu. Because the virus that causes seasonal influenza spreads via respiratory droplets, the safety precautions used to prevent COVID-19, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, also helped cut down flu activity.

What drove down flu activity? Due to influenza’s short incubation period and widespread population immunity, the measures used to stop the spread of COVID-19 also caused flu activity to drastically drop. Between Oct. 1 and Jan. 30, only 155 people in the United States have been hospitalized with the flu. That’s a 98 percent decrease from the same window of time in the 2019-2020 flu season in which 8,633 people were hospitalized with the flu. The precautions used to prevent COVID-19 ended up drastically reducing influenza transmission. Both are respiratory infections that spread via aerosol droplets. “Any precaution you take to avoid COVID will also reduce your risk of contracting an influenza virus. Hand washing, social distancing, and wearing masks are certainly driving down cases of the flu,” said Dr. Casey Kelley, a family medicine physician and the founder and medical director of Case Integrative Health in Chicago.

Why COVID-19 is surging as the flu lies low COVID-19 is thought to be far more infectious than the flu especially as few people have immunity against this new disease. Researchers calculate the contagiousness of a disease by looking at the R number, which represents how many people, on average, a person with the disease will spread the virus to. The R number for COVID-19 is thought to be around 2 to 3, whereas the R number for influenza is around 1 or 2. “No one on Earth had antibodies to COVID-19 when the outbreak started, so every interaction was an opportunity for it to spread,” said Kelley, adding that we’ve had years to build up at least partial immunity to influenza. COVID-19 also has a longer incubation period that can last up to a couple of weeks. With the flu, people typically develop symptoms just a couple of days after being exposed to the virus. “Most people with the flu experience symptoms relatively early in their illness — usually within 2 days of exposure,” said Dr. John Showalter, an expert in communicable diseases and the chief product officer of Jvion in Suwanee, Georgia. Once flu symptoms begin, people usually isolate themselves, reducing the chance they’ll transmit the virus. “With COVID-19, individuals can actively spread the virus for up to 7 days before they experience symptoms,” Showalter said. In addition, COVID-19 often causes irregular symptoms, such as gut issues or headache. “This means many don’t even realize they have — or are spreading — the illness for a week or longer, and likely have not altered their interactions with others during that time,” Showalter said.

Will we see the flu make a comeback next fall? When the pandemic restrictions are lifted, experts suspect the flu will make a comeback. “Flu is one of the most consistent and persistent illnesses in recorded medical history, with reports of influenza-like illness dating back to ancient Greece,” Showalter said. While we will likely see minimal flu activity in the 2021-2022 flu season due to continued safety precautions, Showalter said the flu “isn’t going anywhere.” Kelley is hopeful that the mitigation measures adopted to contain COVID-19 will last and help contain the flu in the future. “Building and maintaining a strong immune system, washing hands, self-isolating when you don’t feel well, and even wearing a mask during the peak flu season will all reduce the spread of flu, even after the pandemic is history,” Kelley said."

In-hospital mortality significantly higher with COVID-19 than flu

Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a mortality risk that was nearly 3.5 times higher than those hospitalized with influenza, according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

“We can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza,” Amol A. Verma, MD, MPhil, BSc, a general internal medicine resident at St. Michael’s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and the University of Toronto, said in a press release. “Patients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza.”

Reference: Verma A, et al, CMAJ. 2021;doi: 10.1503/cmaj.202795.

Verma and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study using information from seven hospitals in Toronto and Ontario. They evaluated adults admitted to the ICU between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020.

A total of 783 admissions for influenza and 1,027 admissions for COVID-19 were included in the study. The researchers noted that these admissions made up 23.5% of all COVID-19 hospital admissions in Ontario during the study period.

Patients aged younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all COVID-19 admissions and 24% of ICU admissions for COVID-19.

The researchers determined that patients admitted with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality compared with those hospitalized with influenza (19.9% vs. 6.1%; adjusted RR [aRR] = 3.46; 95% CI, 2.56-4.68).

They also found that patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater ICU use compared with those with influenza (26.4% vs. 18%; aRR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.25-1.80).

Additionally, patients with COVID-19 had longer length of stay in the hospital, with a median of 8.7 days compared with 4.8 days among patients with influenza (aRR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25-1.69).

According to the researchers, patients with COVID-19 were more likely than those with influenza to undergo invasive mechanical ventilation (18.5% vs. 9.3%; P = 0.001) but were less likely to undergo a bronchoscopy (2% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.005).

The rate of readmission at 30 days was not significantly different between patients admitted with COVID-19 and those with influenza (aRR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.70-1.39).

“These differences may be magnified by low levels of immunity to the novel coronavirus compared with seasonal influenza, which results from past infections and vaccination,” Verma said in the press release. “Hopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe.”

One year ago, UW Health reported seeing more than 1,000 positive cases of influenza. This year, data shows just one person has contracted the flu in the area.

Wisconsin health officials credited the drop in cases to ""precautions people were using to stay safe from COVID-19,"" such as wearing a mask, social distancing, washing hands and staying home when sick.

""The decline in flu numbers is encouraging because I think it would have been worse if we had high numbers of COVID-19 cases coinciding with influenza cases,"" Dr. Nasia Safdar, medical director of infection control at UW Health, said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that influenza activity is ""currently low"" in the U.S. and globally. Health officials said following widespread community mitigation measures to curb COVID-19 cases, positive influenza tests went from over 20% to 2.3%.

Based on health data, the CDC said interventions aimed to halt coronavirus transmissions, in addition to the flu shot, could ""substantially reduce influenza"" in the 2020 - 2021 season in the Northern Hemisphere.

According to CNBC, World Health Organization officials said in December that the coronavirus is mutating ""at a much slower rate"" than seasonal influenza, even as officials in the U.K. explained that a new mutation of the virus is allowing it to spread more easily.

Seasonal influenza mutates so often that scientists have to regularly develop new vaccines to inoculate the population against the virus every year. U.K. officials have told the WHO that the Covid-19 vaccines appear to be just as effective against the new strain, but more research is needed. While all viruses naturally mutate, not every mutation makes a virus more contagious or more virulent.

""SARS-CoV-2 is mutating at a much slower rate than influenza,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said at a press briefing. ""And so far, even though we've seen a number of changes and a number of mutations, none has made a significant impact on either the susceptibility of the virus to any of the currently used therapeutics, drugs, or the vaccines under development, and one hopes that that will continue to be the case."""

Apparently seven people in Russia have been given the bird. The bird flu, that is. And it was some fowl play.

Back in November 2020, I wrote for Forbes about how an avian influenza strain, A(H5N8), was spreading among birds in Europe. Well, it appears that this strain has since made it from birds to some humans. TASS, the Russian News Agency, reported the detection of this strain of the flu in seven poultry farm workers in southern Russia. They quoted Anna Popova, Head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, as saying: ""scientists of the Vector Center isolated the genetic material of this kind of bird flu in seven workers of a poultry farm in the south of the Russian Federation, where an outbreak in bird population was recorded in December 2020."" These would have been the first confirmed cases of A(H5N8) bird flu infections in the world.

TASS reported that all seven farm workers are now in “good health” with the clinical course being “very mild.” According to TASS, Popova said that ""The data on the first case of the infection of humans with the A(H5N8) flu have already been sent to the World Health Organization (WHO). This happened a few days ago, as soon as we became absolutely confident in our results."" They didn’t elaborate on exactly when in December the cases emerged and when Russian authorities actually became aware of the issue. In other words, it’s not clear who knew what when where and how. Apparently, the WHO does know about this now.

Of course, news of humans getting infected by a strain of the bird flu is typically not good. It’s not as if you should say, “way to go viruses! You made it!” Anytime a human gets infected for the first time with a virus that normally infects other animals, there is the potential for major trouble. Your immune system is not used to getting infected with such viruses and, therefore, may not be ready to provide adequate defense. It would be like a cat showing up at your house with a space laser. You wouldn’t quite know what to do and would not be prepared to offer the proper response. An example of a appropriate response might be asking, “would you consider putting down that space laser and sharing some avocado toast with me instead” or simply “meow.”

Even worse, when your immune system is not used to such a threat, it could overreact. It can be like a nervous guy who doesn’t know what to do on a date, just trying anything. Should he talk about his muscles or his car? Should he offer more compliments or sing the song “Hallelujah?” Similarly, your immune system could release all sorts of chemicals and mobilize cells in an misguided effort to stamp out the threat. As a result, your immune system could still miss the virus but along the way severely damage your own body.

This is essentially what happened when the Covid-19 coronavirus, otherwise known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in case you want to use more words to describe the same thing, somehow made its way from other animals such as bats to humans. You as a human, assuming that you are human and not a hedgehog dressed as a human, did not have the proper defenses in your body set up already. When you got infected with the SARS-CoV2, you and your immune system were essentially caught with your proverbial pants down, unless of course your were on a Zoom call without your pants.

It’s also what happened back in 2009, when a swine flu strain, H1N1, jumped to humans. If you recall, the result was a pandemic as well, albeit one that wasn’t as severe as the current one.

Pictured here are chickens for sale at a market in Russia. (Photo by Vladimir Smirnov\TASS via Getty ... [+] Images) Vladimir Smirnov/TASS

That doesn’t mean that you should press the panic button whenever a jump from other animals to humans occurs. First of all, if you have a panic button installed in your bedroom, you should really re-consider the purpose of having such a button. Secondly, not every jump will lead to badness.

Expect such jumps of viruses from other animals to humans to occur here and there. Viruses like flu viruses are constantly having mutations. After infecting an animal, they effectively play the song “Let’s Get It On” over and over again, using the machinery in the animal’s cells to reproduce a lot. But a virus using a cell to reproduce yourself is like a cat using a photocopy machine. There will be errors in at least some of the copies.

With a relatively high mutation rate, each new copy of the virus has a chance of having a slightly different genetic code. This resulting mutations may not affect the virus in any concrete way or actually make the virus less capable of doing things. However, if the mutation actually improves the virus’s ability to survive and infect others like humans, then this new mutant strain may have a “fitness advantage.” This new strain can soon outcompete other strains and with more of its progeny surviving, become more common. This is how variants can arise and spread. A strain that can infect humans in addition to other animals can be more likely to survive and thrive because it has more options to have umm “Cake by the Ocean,” which incidentally is not really about deserts by the sea.

Of course, just because a virus can jump to humans for the first time doesn’t mean that a pandemic will begin. Unless a new dance craze starts where every human around the world gets paired up with a bird, the feathery kind of bird, it’s unlikely that a virus that can only spread from bird to human will have pandemic-potential. The big leap would be for a mutation to arise that would allow humans to pass the viruses along to each other. Thankfully, so far, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N8 strain.

Nevertheless, this is a reminder that viruses are periodically able to jump from other animals to humans. Some of these leaps may lead to a small number of humans getting a bit sick. Some may lead to more severe illness. And some may become bigger problems, perhaps even “oh bleep” problems. Therefore, humans need to remain vigilant and set up surveillance systems that can catch and report these jumps as soon as possible, and not one or two months after they happen. You may be able to see Russia from your house if you happen to be from certain parts of Alaska. But right now, the rest of the world is relying on Russian public health authorities to quickly identify and control any outbreaks that may happen in Russia.

These jumps can happen anywhere around the world. Viruses don’t say, “oh, let’s jump close to a big medical laboratory so that we can be discovered and dealt with quickly.” Ideally, public health experts around the world should hear about a December outbreak in December or as soon afterwards as possible. Otherwise, delays in detecting, investigating, and reporting a virus jumping from birds to humans could end up giving a lot more people around the world the bird, the bird flu that is."

Two antibodies (VIR-7831 and VIR-7832) are now in clinical trials.

The expanded collaboration provides GSK with exclusive rights to collaborate with Vir on the development of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention or treatment of influenza. GSK will increase its equity investment in Vir by $120m and make an upfront payment of $225m, with the potential for a further $200m milestone payments. It also gains the option to develop monoclonal antibody VIR-2382 past Phase 2 trials: in which case it will pay a fee of $300m.

Influenza A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody

The expanded collaboration includes VIR-2482: an investigational intramuscularly administered influenza A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In vitro, VIR-2482 has been shown to cover all major strains of influenza A that have arisen since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

VIR-2482 is designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A. GSK and Vir see its potential to overcome the limitations of current flu vaccines and lead to higher levels of protection thanks to its broad strain coverage, and because it does not rely on an individual to create their own protective antibody response. VIR-2482 has been half-life engineered so that a single dose has the potential to last the entire flu season.

Vir will continue to fund the development of VIR-2382 for the time being: with GSK getting the exclusive option to co-develop VIR-2482 after Vir completes and reports Phase 2 trial outcomes. If GSK exercises its option, it will pay a fee of $300m.

The agreement will also include a three-year research period where GSK and Vir will explore next generation antibodies for the prevention or treatment of influenza. GSK and Vir will share development costs and profits on these programs.

Influenza causes up to 500,000 hospitalisations and 34,000 deaths each year in the US alone, with around 75% of these caused by Influenza A.

Vir's antibody tech Vir’s antibody platform seeks to capitalise on unusually successful immune responses in certain people to infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from recovered patients that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. Its platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B virus, influenza A, Ebola (mAb114, approved for use in the US as Ebanga), malaria, and others. The first antibody under the 2020 GSK/Vir partnership, VIR-7831, is currently being investigated in two global phase 3 studies; for the early treatment of COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of hospitalisation, and for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The companies will investigate a second antibody, VIR-7832,​​ in the early treatment of COVID-19 in a Phase 1b/2a trial starting in the first quarter of this year.

Other respiratory targets

Two additional research programmes outside of influenza will also be included in the expanded GSK-Vir collaboration.

The first will expand their current functional genomics program – which is developing potential pan-coronavirus therapeutics - to now include other respiratory virus targets.

Another program will see the companies collaborate to develop up to three neutralising monoclonal antibodies, identified using Vir’s antibody technology platform, to target non-influenza pathogens during a three-year research period.

George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “As part of our functional genomics collaboration directed at COVID-19, we have turned up multiple targets that have the potential to treat influenza and other respiratory viruses, and it makes sense to extend the scope of our collaboration to include these new targets. ​

“This expanded collaboration supports the rapid advancement of multiple promising investigational compounds in our pipeline, increasing the likelihood that these potential life-saving treatments will reach patients sooner, and will advance our shared goal of developing single drugs that can address multiple ‘bugs.’”​"

What

An experimental single-dose, intranasal influenza vaccine was safe and produced a durable immune response when tested in a Phase 1 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The investigational vaccine, called Ad4-H5-VTN, is a recombinant, replicating adenovirus vaccine designed to spur antibodies to hemagglutinin, a protein found on the surface of influenza viruses that attaches to human cells.

The investigational vaccine was developed by Emergent Biosolutions Inc., (Gaithersburg, Maryland). It was administered intranasally (28 study participants), as an oral capsule (10 participants) and via a tonsillar swab (25 participants) to healthy men and non-pregnant women ages 18 to 49 years.

The participants who received the vaccine intranasally or via tonsillar swab showed significantly higher H5-specific neutralizing antibody levels compared to the group receiving the vaccine capsule orally. The participants who received the intranasal vaccine shed viral DNA for two-to-four weeks, but virus could be cultured for a median of only one day. Participants had evidence of H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Additionally, volunteers who received the intranasal vaccine had high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies at 26 weeks after vaccination, and this level was unchanged at three to five years after a single intranasal dose of the vaccine. The duration of viral shedding correlated with a high magnitude of neutralizing antibody response at week 26. In addition, the intranasal vaccine induced a mucosal antibody response in the nose, mouth, and rectum.

The study authors speculate that replication-competent vector vaccines may have advantages over other types of vaccines because they can express viral proteins at higher levels and for longer durations. Additionally, this type of vaccine induces a mucosal immune response that is critical for limiting transmission of viruses that infect mucosal tissues.

The vaccine platform could be highly adaptable for use against other viruses including HIV and SARS-CoV-2, according to the authors.

Recent H5N8 outbreaks have also been reported from Africa.
It also said ferret studies of earlier H5N8 viruses showed that it doesn't transmit efficiently.","cases, h5n8, reports, outbreaks, wild, flu, human, health, reported, viruses, risk, russia, avian",Influenza,pandemic,"Russia over the weekend reported cases of the first known H5N8 avian flu infection in humans and said it has reported the findings to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The cases were announced on Feb 20 by Anna Popova, who leads Russia's consumer health watchdog, according to Reuters.

On state TV, she said the country reported the cases to the WHO several days ago after it was sure of the results. The cases involve seven workers at a poultry plant in the south of the country.

WHO gathering more information

The WHO's European regional office told Reuters that Russia had notified the WHO about a human H5N8 case and that, if confirmed, the event would mark the first known infection in humans. It added that early information says the cases involve seven workers exposed to bird flocks who were asymptomatic, with no onward transmission reported.

The office said it was working to gather more information and assess the health impact.

In a December update on H5N8, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said H5N8 has been reported in birds since the 1980s, and the virus has been reported in the Northern Hemisphere every year since 2014.

The first wild bird outbreaks in 2020 were reported by Russia in August and were followed a few months later by reported outbreaks in poultry. The outbreaks were rapidly followed by similar events in other countries in Europe, along with China, Iran, Japan, and South Korea. Recent H5N8 outbreaks have also been reported from Africa.

Earlier assessments put threat to humans as low

The risk of human infections can't be ruled out, though the likelihood is low, the OIE said. In a January outbreak update, the OIE said H5N8 viruses have reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1, which have also been reported in countries that experienced recent H5N8 outbreaks.

The WHO said in a 2016 risk assessment that human infections with H5N8 can't be excluded, but the likelihood is low, based on limited information. However, it noted that human infections with H5N6 involving the related H5 clade 2.3.4.4 have been reported from China. It also said ferret studies of earlier H5N8 viruses showed that it doesn't transmit efficiently.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza risk assessment tool, used to assess potential pandemic risk, puts H5N8 in the low-moderate range, based on an H5N8 sample collected at the end of 2014 in a falcon. The virus—in the same clade and similar to Eurasian lineage viruses—was also detected in wild birds, backyard birds, and commercial flocks in the United States.

One candidate vaccine virus has been developed against the earlier H5N8 strain, according to the WHO's list of vaccine viruses that are available for pandemic preparedness."

Avian influenza is a known potential zoonotic disease and there are internationally established measures in place that ensure food safety and the proper handling and cooking of poultry, as well as worker safety and biosecurity. Further, diseased poultry should not enter the food supply.

In Russia, authorities responded promptly to the incident, implementing measures to protect humans and animals and to minimize risks, ensuring that the situation did not progress. All seven people affected are in good health and the clinical course of the disease was very mild, authorities confirmed. The Russian Head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing also stated that the WHO (World Health Organization) has been notified, according to normal protocol.

Based upon scientific understanding of avian influenza, chicken and other poultry products are safe to eat if cooked properly, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). No birds from flocks with the disease should enter the food chain, they note, and consumers can remain confident in the safety of poultry meat and in the efforts of the poultry industry to guarantee safety and security for its customers.

The poultry industry, in coordination with government authorities, continuously monitors and seeks to identify avian influenza risks early. These risks are in part due to exposure to virus-positive wild animals. As in this case, immediate actions are taken to identify the specific strains. These ongoing efforts control the spread of the disease. Moreover, biosecurity measures implemented by the industry minimise the risk of transfer the disease.

Furthermore, the scientific literature shows unequivocally that avian influenza is not a food safety issue. Chicken meat is nutritious and safe; consumers must only cook and prepare it properly, following the normal rules of hygiene.

In certain rare situations, individuals who have frequent and prolonged contact with poultry species — mainly people working in the sector — have become infected with the avian influenza virus, as occurred in this case. This accidental infection is self-limiting because the infected person is unlikely to pass the virus to anyone else.

Governments and industry monitor specifically for the potential transfer of avian influenza to humans, and act accordingly to eliminate such risks. And, as noted here, the virus cannot be transferred from one human to another. Consumers can therefore be assured that properly cooked poultry is safe to eat."

Their findings are similar to recent studies from the United States and France. The study was published Feb. 10 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

""We can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza,"" said study author Dr. Amol Verma, a researcher in the School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.

""Patients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU, and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza,"" he said in a journal news release. These patients were also more likely to be put on a ventilator.

Verma's team compared flu- and COVID-related hospitalizations between Nov. 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at seven hospitals in Toronto and nearby Mississauga. Both have large populations and high COVID infection rates.

During the study period, there were 783 hospitalizations for flu in 763 patients, and 1,027 hospitalizations for COVID in 972 patients. That represented nearly a quarter of all COVID hospitalizations in the entire province of Ontario during that time.

About 1 in 5 COVID patients was younger than 50, and that age group accounted for nearly 1 in 4 intensive care admissions.

While many people believe COVID-19 mainly affects older people, ""it can also cause very serious illness in younger adults,"" Verma said.

He noted that adults under age 50 accounted for 20% of COVID hospitalizations in the first wave of the pandemic. Nearly 1 in 3 adults under 50 required intensive care and nearly 1 in 10 had to be readmitted to the hospital after they were discharged, according to the study.

It is true, Verma added, that COVID hits older adults the hardest.

""We found that among adults over 75 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19, nearly 40% died in hospital,"" he said.

Researchers said COVID might be much more dangerous than flu because people have lower levels of immunity to the new coronavirus than to seasonal flu. Past flu infections and vaccinations have helped people build immunity to the illness.

""Hopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe,"" Verma said.

The flu season has been virtually nonexistent this season — with the lowest rate of hospitalization ever since that data has been tallied.

Just 165 flu-related hospitalizations were recorded between Oct. 1 and Feb. 6, according to recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That’s compared to roughly 400,000 people who were hospitalized during the 2019-2020 flu season, which also saw 22,000 deaths.

“This is lower than average for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005, including the low severity 2011-12 season,” the CDC said.

With many schools closed, more school kids have been staying home during the global health crisis, which has likely helped in stopping the spread of influenza, NPR reported.

“COVID can be transmitted very readily among adults — very contagious — but flu, I think, really needs children to spread it around amongst themselves and then seed, if you will, the adults in their home and their neighbors,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, told the station’s “Weekend Edition.”

“Children are generally thought of as having the distribution franchise for the influenza virus,” he added. “They produce much more virus, they shed more virus for longer periods of time.”

Last year, a record number of people got the flu shot — amid warnings from health experts of the unprecedented combination of the flu season and the deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Nearly 52 percent of people age 6 months and older were inoculated, an increase of 2.6 percent from the prior season, the CDC said.

The mild season has also been aided by COVID-19 safety measures, including mask wearing and social distancing.

“Flu has been essentially nonexistent” this season, Schaffner said.

But he also warned that flu could return with a vengeance come the fall.

“Many of us didn’t get a boost from encountering the flu virus this year, and so we haven’t had a chance to build up our antibodies,” he said. “All the more important to get vaccinated this fall.”"

Vaccines promise to defang the new coronavirus, taming it so that it's unable to cause serious disease and deaths, or threaten hospitals' ability to deal with patients.

Herd immunity may be reached in a few months, but what happens next isn't easy to predict.

Will COVID-19 ever go away entirely or is it here to stay?

Experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, say it’s likely to stay and become an endemic disease — one that occurs frequently at a predictable rate in a specific area, like the common cold in North America or malaria in Africa — though it will circulate at much lower levels, produce milder symptoms and become much more manageable than when it first emerged.

“I doubt we are going to eradicate this,” Fauci said in November.

When the journal Nature recently polled more than 100 immunologists, infectious disease researchers and virologists, 89% thought the new coronavirus would become endemic.

Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security in Baltimore and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, agreed.

“I've never thought it would go away. This is an efficiently spreading respiratory virus that comes from a family of viruses, of which four others cause 25% of our common colds. It’s established itself in the human population,” Adalja told TODAY.

“But what will happen is that it will be no longer able to kill people at the rate that it is currently doing. It will still be here — we will still see cases, we will still have issues with it — but it will never be a public health emergency the way it is now.”

Adalja predicted the new coronavirus would become the fifth seasonal coronavirus people deal with every year, although the damage it causes will be severely limited.

If COVID-19 becomes seasonal, what will be the season?

It would likely coincide with the cold and flu season: “Coronaviruses in general tend to peak in the colder months,” Adalja said.

The U.S. didn't see that seasonality in 2020 because there was so much spread of COVID-19 and so little immunity to it when summer arrived that the warmer weather didn’t have much impact, he added.

Will people have to get an annual COVID-19 vaccine, similar to an annual flu shot?

That remains to be seen, with some experts leaning toward “yes.”

People may need to get vaccinated against COVID-19 annually over the next several years, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC. The company applied for emergency authorization of its vaccine candidate this month.

“This virus is showing an incredible ability to mutate, to change, to adapt, in a sense, to everything we’re putting against it,” Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC News senior medical correspondent Dr. John Torres.

Even if the current COVID-19 vaccines are found to be less effective in blocking infection from the South African and Brazilian variants, they may still prevent hospitalization and death, so they may function more like a flu vaccine in preventing severe disease, Adalja noted.

Or it may be that one vaccine update will be required, and then the virus becomes more stable without the need for continually updating the shot, he added.

But when it comes to the vaccine experience, it's hard to compare it to what happens with influenza because the flu and COVID-19 are completely different viruses, Adalja cautioned.

What will happen with testing, mask wearing and restrictions?

Experts predicted COVID-19 testing would become more routine, similar to the way doctors test people for influenza. “I don't think you would see dedicated COVID-19 testing sites after this season,” Adalja said.

Mask mandates will likely fade away, but Americans will probably keep wearing face coverings during future cold and flu seasons — similar to what happens in many Asian countries, he added. The virtually non-existent 2020-2021 flu season has shown how effective mask-wearing and other precautions can be at stopping viral spread.

Once the vulnerable populations are vaccinated for COVID-19 and hospitals aren’t worried about being overwhelmed, the restrictions on restaurants, gyms and other businesses will be lifted, Adalja predicted. But many adaptations implemented during the crisis — such as better air filtration systems and enhanced sanitation — will likely stay in place; and telecommuting and telemedicine will continue to be popular.

“There are going to be lots of changes in society that that occur because of the pandemic,” Adalja said."

The remarkably low number of influenza diagnoses makes it possible for clinical laboratories to stay focused on COVID-19

One positive note for clinical laboratories this winter is the fact that the number of biological samples being submitted for influenza (flu) testing have dropped significantly. This has given medical laboratories more resources for processing COVID-19 tests.

Dark Daily’s sister publication The Dark Report covered this phenomenon in “Surprise! Many Fewer Cases of Flu in Us, Canada, Europe,” December 7, 2020.

According to a feature published in Nature, the number of samples being submitted to medical laboratories for flu testing has dropped by 61%. More surprisingly, the number of positives has dropped by 98%. The combined flu/COVID-19 “twindemic” that some medical experts feared could crush our healthcare system has not materialized—yet, the Washington Examiner reported.

“In any given winter, hospitals are taxed by the flu,” Brian Garibaldi, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist and Medical Director of the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit told the Washington Examiner. “There’s always a concern that our emergency departments will be overwhelmed, and ICU capacity will be strained [due to the concurrence of flu and COVID-19 outbreaks], particularly with people who have coexisting conditions that then get influenza.”

The 2019-2020 flu season ended earlier than usual, likely because of precautions put in place in the spring to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Most years, the seasonal flu in the US peaks in February and trails off by May, Nature reported in “How Coronavirus Lockdowns Stopped Flu in Its Tracks.”

“Seasonal flu cases in the northern hemisphere usually peak in February and tail off by the end of May,” Nature wrote. “This year, unusually, lab-confirmed cases of influenza dropped precipitously in early April, a few weeks after the coronavirus pandemic was declared on 11 March. The data comes from tests of more than 150,000 samples from national influenza laboratories in 71 countries that report data to FluNet, a global surveillance system.”

Government Leaders and Health Experts Remain Concerned

Despite that encouraging data point, public health experts and political leaders were still concerned. In September, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said, “The overlap of COVID-19 and flu season presents a perfect storm, and we aren’t taking any chances. We are approaching this fall with a proactive mindset and plan of action to limit the impact of the flu and preserve hospital resources,” the Washington Examiner reported.

The caution was certainly warranted. A normal flu season strains resources, but a severe flu season coupled with a global pandemic could have been disastrous. Luckily, Ducey’s “perfect storm” did not materialize.

Data from the World Health Organization’s FluNet Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System was used by Nature to develop the graphic above. It illustrates how the number of positive Influenza specimens in 2019-2020 declined compared to the previous two years. Some experts believe this is due to protocols implemented to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus by hospitals and clinical laboratories. (Graphic copyright: Nature.)

Why Is There Less Influenza?

So, why is there less flu and other respiratory infections?

Epidemiologist Lisa Lockerd Maragakis, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Medicine and Senior Director of Infection Prevention at Johns Hopkins Health System, told U.S. News, widespread business and school closures provide fewer opportunities for influenza to spread. “We commonly see flu spread in communities, schools, businesses and through travel each year, so those changes are likely keeping the flu away.”

However, this may have a negative effect as well. Eili Klein, PhD, Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, warns that “Because of the current restrictions and precautions everyone is taking this season, far fewer people will be infected or exposed to the flu virus, and therefore won’t become immune to certain strains of the virus. So, the number of people who may have more severe infections next year is likely to be greater because immunity will be lower,” the Washington Examiner reported.

Other Viral Infections Also in Decline Due to COVID-19 Precautions, Vaccines

Masking, frequent handwashing, and social distancing certainly played a role in reducing the number of cases of flu reported this year. But influenza is not the only disease that saw reductions. “In Hong Kong, compared with previous years, the number of chickenpox cases dropped by about half to three-quarters,” Nature reported. “In April, cases of measles and rubella were their lowest, globally, since at least 2016, according to data available so far.”

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, some public health officials were concerned that the decline in influenza cases was actually related to a lack of testing. “However, renewed efforts by public health officials and clinicians to test samples for influenza resulted in adequate numbers tested and detection of little to no influenza virus,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported.

Another factor in the lower numbers of flu cases could be due to the fact that more people have gotten vaccinated this year. More than 188 million flu vaccines were distributed in 2020, an increase compared to the 169 million given in 2019.

“Flu vaccination in the community started earlier this year, as recommended by the CDC, and our community physicians report that vaccine uptake has been higher than usual,” Marie-Louise Landry, MD, Clinical Virologist, Professor of Laboratory Medicine and of Medicine (Infectious Diseases), and Director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine, told Healthline.

It may also be that influenza diagnoses are fewer because people are not seeking treatment. Hospitals at or beyond capacity due to the pandemic, or fear of contracting COVID-19, may have motivated people with flu-like symptoms to stay home rather than seek treatment. However, most healthcare experts agree that public health measures to fight COVID-19 are likely the larger reason there is less flu.

“Public health measures such as movement restrictions, social distancing, and increased personal hygiene likely had an effect on decreasing influenza and other respiratory virus transmissions,” the World Health Organization (WHO) told Nature.

What About the Next Flu Season?

Experts are more conflicted regarding what all of this means for coming flu seasons. Some experts think that because there’s less flu this year, there will be less immunity next year, and severe illness will result. Others are more optimistic and hope that some strains of flu will disappear, which could mean less flu in the immediate future. It’s not a simple prediction to make.

“A lot of different flus have been circulating in recent years. Are they all going to make it out of this or not? It’s possible that what this season will do is actually make the virological picture a lot simpler. That may be permanent, potentially,” Richard Webby, PhD, an infectious disease scientist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told Nature in “How COVID-19 is Changing the Cold and Flu Season.”

Even if the low flu numbers this year mean some strains do not survive, it is unlikely that will remain the case. “I am sure that flu will come back with a vengeance at some stage in the future,” Robert Ware, PhD, a biostatistician, clinical epidemiologist, and Professor of Biostatistics with Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, told Nature.

Thus, clinical laboratories should remain vigilant for future influenza outbreaks. Hopefully by then the COVID-19 pandemic will have peaked and labs will be able to reallocate testing resources appropriately.

Influenza viruses are a broad category of viruses under the Orthomyxoviridae family, capable of causing flu. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D.

An epidemic or a pandemic arises when a new strain of the virus emerges. Since the population has no immunity against the new strain, it spreads quickly and widely.

Since the past few weeks, avian influenza (bird flu) cases have been reported from several states of India. Several thousands of ducks and chickens have been culled to contain the situation in Kerala, Gujarat, Haryana, and Bihar. There is rising panic among the public regarding the transmission of the flu to humans.

Awareness about bird flu will enable people to take necessary measures to contain it which in turn will help the cumulative efforts by the public health departments. Often, by the time people recognise that the spread of disease is turning into a pandemic or epidemic, it may be too late to call for action. However, if people are familiar with the science behind diseases and their spread, they can identify the severity sooner making things much easier for the concerned departments.

What are influenza viruses?

Influenza viruses are a broad category of viruses under the Orthomyxoviridae family, capable of causing flu, which is a contagious respiratory illness infecting the nose, throat, and lungs. There are four types of such viruses: A, B, C, and D. Of these, Influenza A takes the most severe form in humans. It spreads by zoonotic transfer i.e., from animals to humans. Influenza B on the other hand spreads only from human to human and is mostly characterised by mild infections. Influenza C causes mild infections and influenza D is present only in animals especially cattle. Influenza A and B are responsible for the flu season in India (October- March).

Influenza A virus has several subtypes based on the proteins in the outer envelope of the virus, i.e., Hemagglutinin (H) and Neuraminidase (N). This is where the H and N in the name of Influenza virus come from. Again, there are 18 different types of H and 11 different types of N – from H1 to H18 and from N1 to N11. The various permutations and combinations give 198 different subtypes. However, only 131 such combinations have been detected so far in nature.

How does an epidemic or a pandemic arise?

An epidemic or a pandemic arises whenever a new strain of the virus emerges. Since the population has no immunity against the new strain, it spreads quickly and widely. There are two reasons for the influenza viruses to cause an epidemic: antigenic shift and genetic reassortment. Viruses multiply by entering the host body through the epithelial cell and then release their viral genetic material (RNA/ DNA) into the host cytoplasm.

So when two different strains of viruses enter the same host, chances are high that their viral RNA might get intermixed resulting in a new strain of virus having surface antigens of both the strains thus capable of infecting both the hosts. Since the hosts do not have immunity against the new strain it spreads rapidly resulting in a new epidemic if it is confined with a community or a country and a pandemic if it spreads across countries. This is what happened in all the outbreaks of avian influenza.

Though the probability of human to human transmission of avian influenza is low, chances cannot be entirely ruled out. Major modes of transmission of avian influenza are direct, through inhalation of infectious droplets or indirect, through fomites. Once exposed to the virus, initial symptoms come in the form of high fever (more than 38 degrees Celsius).

Advanced symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, etc. Initial symptoms appear 4-5 days following exposure. Children, adults of the age 65+, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, kidney disorders, etc. are more vulnerable to this disease, says a 2005 study.

The recent outbreak of H5N8 started from migratory birds, especially the bar-headed geese, an aquatic duck. Several thousands of ducks were found dead near water bodies, which is when the issue was brought to the attention of the animal husbandry officials. Ducks are the natural hosts of this virus. These viruses are highly pathogenic to poultry, which is why rapid culling of chickens and ducks is done.

To date, 40,000 birds are culled in Kerala alone. Standard precautions suggested by WHO are to follow hygienic cooking practices and to properly cook poultry since cooking temperatures are sufficient enough to kill the Influenza A (H5N8) virus.

GENEVA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The risk of human-to-human spread of the H5N8 strain of bird flu appears low after it was identified for the first time worldwide in farm workers in Russia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

A separate influenza strain, H1N1, that emerged from pigs and spread rapidly worldwide among humans led the WHO to declare an influenza pandemic in 2009-2010. The outbreak turned out to be mild among humans.

Russia registered the first case of a strain of bird flu virus named influenza A(H5N8) being passed to humans from birds and has reported the matter to the WHO, Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said on Saturday. read more

Seven people in Russia were found to be infected with H5N8, but all were asymptomatic following an outbreak on a poultry farm in the southern oblast (region) of Astrakhan, a WHO statement said. The death of 101,000 of the farm's 900,000 egg-laying hens in December had sparked the investigation, it said.

""All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness,"" it said. ""Based on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.""

The WHO advised against any special traveller screening at points of entry or restrictions on travel and or trade with the Russian Federation, it added.

Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain were reported last year in poultry or wild birds in Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Russia, according to WHO.

The WHO statement said that developing zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines remains an essential part of WHO strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.

LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR) today announced they have signed a binding agreement to expand their existing collaboration to include the research and development of new therapies for influenza and other respiratory viruses.

The expanded collaboration, which builds on the agreement signed in 2020 to research and develop therapies for coronaviruses, provides GSK exclusive rights to collaborate with Vir on the development of potential best-in-class monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the prevention or treatment of influenza. These include VIR-2482, an intramuscularly administered investigational mAb designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A that has completed a Phase 1 trial, as well as next-generation antibodies for the prevention or treatment of influenza during a three-year research period. GSK will have the exclusive option to co-develop VIR-2482 after Vir completes and reports Phase 2 trial outcomes, and will share development costs on the development of all other influenza mAbs.

Influenza causes up to 500,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths each year in the United States alone,1 approximately 75% of which are caused by influenza A.2 The protection provided by current vaccines varies from season to season, based on the virus strains circulating. People over 65 years of age with at least one comorbidity, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or who are immunocompromised, are at significantly increased risk of flu and flu-related hospitalization and mortality. This is also a population where the currently available vaccines have historically had lower efficacy.

As part of the new collaboration agreement, the companies will also engage in two additional research programs. The first is an expansion of their current functional genomics collaboration to develop potential pan-coronavirus therapeutics to now include other respiratory virus targets. Under the second program, the companies will collaborate to develop up to three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies identified using Vir’s antibody technology platform to target non-influenza pathogens during a three-year research period.

Dr. Hal Barron, Chief Scientific Officer and President R&D, GSK, said: “We believe, now more than ever, that it is very important to develop new therapies to treat and ideally prevent infectious diseases. I am delighted that we are expanding our collaboration with Vir whose focus on novel antibodies, expertise in functional genomics, unique technology and talented scientists will further strengthen GSK’s position as a world leader in infectious diseases.”

George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO, Vir Biotechnology, said: “GSK has been a valuable strategic partner and scientific collaborator in the fight against COVID-19. As part of our functional genomics collaboration directed at COVID-19, we have turned up multiple targets that have the potential to treat influenza and other respiratory viruses, and it makes sense to extend the scope of our collaboration to include these new targets. This expanded collaboration supports the rapid advancement of multiple promising investigational compounds in our pipeline, increasing the likelihood that these potential life-saving treatments will reach patients sooner, and will advance our shared goal of developing single drugs that can address multiple ‘bugs.’”

Under the terms of the agreement, GSK will make an upfront payment of $225 million and a further equity investment in Vir of $120 million. Initially, Vir will continue to fund the development of VIR-2482 through completion of Phase 2 trials, after which time, if GSK exercises its option to co-develop VIR-2482, it will pay an option fee of $300 million. Following option exercise for VIR-2482, and for each other program in the expanded collaboration, the companies will share the development costs and related profits associated with this agreement. GSK will also pay Vir up to $200 million based on the successful delivery of pre-defined regulatory milestones. The equity investment and collaboration agreement are conditional upon customary conditions including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

GSK and Vir entered into an initial strategic collaboration in April 2020 to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The focus of the collaboration to date has been the development of specific antibody candidates identified by Vir’s monoclonal antibody platform, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, that have demonstrated the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells, and to provide a high barrier to resistance. VIR-7831 is currently in two global Phase 3 studies as monotherapy and one Phase 2 study as combination therapy, with initial results from the first of the Phase 3 studies expected in the first quarter of 2021. VIR-7832 has been accepted into the NHS-supported AGILE Phase 1b/2a study with a planned start in February 2021.

About Vir’s Antibody Platform

Vir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B virus, influenza A, Ebola (mAb114, approved for use in the U.S. as EbangaTM and marketed by Ridgeback Therapeutics LP), malaria and others.

About VIR-2482

VIR-2482 is an investigational intramuscularly administered influenza A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In vitro, it has been shown to cover all major strains of influenza A that have arisen since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. VIR-2482 is designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of current flu vaccines and lead to meaningfully higher levels of protection due to its broad strain coverage and because it does not rely on an individual to create their own protective antibody response. VIR-2482 has been half-life engineered so that a single dose has the potential to last the entire flu season.

About VIR-7831 / GSK4182137

VIR-7831 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7831 also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life.

About VIR-7832 / GSK4182136

VIR-7832 is an investigational dual-action SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. Preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells. The antibody binds to an epitope on SARS-CoV-2 that is shared with SARS-CoV-1 (the virus that causes SARS), indicating that the epitope is highly conserved, which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop. VIR-7832 also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and to have an extended half-life. Importantly, VIR-7832 has also been engineered to potentially enhance virus-specific T cell function, which could help treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection.

About the Vir and GSK Collaboration

In April 2020, Vir and GSK entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The collaboration uses Vir’s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. The companies are leveraging GSK’s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in CRISPR screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti-coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes. They are also applying their combined expertise to research SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus vaccines.

About Vir Biotechnology

Vir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes.

A 'strikingly different' flu season

According to Rachel Baker, who studies public health and infectious disease at Princeton University's High Meadows Environmental Institute, this year's flu season was ""strikingly different,"" with nearly no flu in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter of 2020-21. Nor was there much of a flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, according to Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.

According to CDC, the hospitalization rate for the 2020-21 flu season in America was just 0.7 per 100,000 people—the lowest since the agency started tracking flu data in 2005. In fact, over the course of the last flu season, there was just one pediatric flu death—compared to 196 in the 2019-20 flu season.

Part of the reason for that sudden drop-off could simply be a lack of testing for influenza, as health officials had to focus their resources on addressing Covid-19, John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, said.

But a major reason for that decline is the social distancing implemented to stave off Covid-19. Baker and her colleagues estimated that these measures led to a 20% drop in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission throughout the United States—and it likely was similarly effective at stemming influenza spread.

""This is one of the clear signals that these interventions work,"" Baker said. ""They are really efficient at stopping the spread of these viruses.""

But that silver lining may come at a cost

While the historically low levels of flu spared the country from what experts called a ""twindemic""—a strong flu season hitting amid an ongoing Covid-19 outbreak—the pandemic's silver lining may come at a cost. According to Politico, the lack of a 2020-21 flu season means that scientists have little data to create effective vaccines in anticipation of the 2021-22 flu season.

Traditionally, to predict which flu strains will dominate the upcoming flu season, WHO convenes experts twice a year, once each for the Northern and Southern hemispheres, who examine data on flu strain spread collected by labs located around the world, including CDC.

During the meeting for the Northern Hemisphere, experts use data on what strains are affecting the Southern Hemisphere to predict which strains will hit the northern half of the globe a few months later. Then, an FDA advisory committee reviews those recommendations to decide how it will license flu vaccines for the coming year, Politico reports.

This year, the committee struggled to find any appropriate precedent. ""What we asked … during that meeting was, 'Has there ever been a moment like this one?'"" Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania and committee member, said. He added, ""[T]his really is unprecedented.""

The closest flu season the United States has had to the 2020-21 season was the 2011-12 season, according to CDC, which set records at the time of the lowest and shortest flu peak. However, the numbers from the 2020-21 flu season are two-thirds lower than the rates of the 2011-12 season, CDC reports.

The good news is that the 2011-12 flu season didn't precede a bad flu season in 2012-13, nor did vaccine efficacy decline during the 2012-13 season—but it's still too early to anticipate how the 2021-22 season will play out.

For his part, Offit believes the flu levels this year still provided enough information for the committee to determine which strains the flu vaccine should protect against. ""The belief is that there was enough circulating virus to be able to pick what is likely to be the strains that are associated with next year's flu outbreak,"" he said.

But in the absence of data, other experts are proposing staying the course from the previous flu season. For instance, Barr and McCauley supported keeping three of the four strains in the 2021-22 vaccine the same as they were in 2019-20's version for the Southern Hemisphere.

According to McCauley, that approach essentially banks on the idea that fewer infections in the 2020-21 season means the influenza virus didn't have many chances to mutate, and therefore the 2021-22 season will likely have the same dominate strains.

How bad will upcoming flu seasons be?

Some experts have voiced concerns about the upcoming flu season in the context of a ""pandemic-weary country,"" Politico reports—especially if a highly effective flu vaccine can't be developed. For instance, Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, said as country starts to fully emerge from the pandemic, ""we may have a combination of low public health measures at the population level with a low effectiveness vaccine,"" potentially resulting in ""a raging flu season next year.""

On the other hand, it's possible that the population may become more comfortable using social distancing measures every flu season to stem the spread of influenza. But some experts are skeptical the lessons of 2020 will stick.

""I mean, could we reasonably in a winter month, wear masks just at least when we're outside in large crowds?"" Offit said. ""Did we learn that or are we … comfortable having hundreds of thousands of cases of hospitalizations for flu and tens of thousands [of] deaths? I suspect the answer is B. We're comfortable with that, we're willing to have that even though we just learned, there's a way to prevent it.""

Gostin agreed, saying that pandemic fatigue could lead people to stop wearing masks and stop social distancing during flu season.

""Remember after the 1918 flu pandemic, most people don't realize what happened when that was over. But what happened was the roaring '20s,"" Gostin said. ""People started congregating, mingling, hugging, kissing. All the things they missed. They crowded into theaters and stadiums and went back to church. That's what's likely to happen this fall and that makes the influenza virus very happy"" (Hilton, Politico, 3/25; Owens, Medscape, 3/3)."

“I think that that obliteration of the flu epidemic, which was seen globally, tells us that the way that influenza is transmitted from one person to another might really have been impacted by the use of masks, more than anything else,” said Flor Munoz, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious-diseases committee.

Influenza spreads reliably each fall and winter, although with different dominant strains and at varying levels. But this year’s coronavirus pandemic has caused many people to keep their distance from others, avoid travel and work from home, stalling flu transmission.

Widespread mask-wearing may be particularly helpful because face coverings limit the spread of the droplets that carry influenza, Munoz said. A dominant pathogen, like the coronavirus that causes covid-19, can also crowd out other viruses by conferring partial immunity to them. Combined with the flu vaccine and existing immunity, those factors have made flu circulation nearly negligible.

The result has been that only about 0.1 percent of flu tests are coming back positive, compared with 20 to 30 percent at this time in other years, said Lynnette Brammer, who leads the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team. Adults are also experiencing a dramatic drop in influenza deaths, with about 450 so far this season, compared with roughly 22,000 last year.

The current trend is unlikely to hold. Influenza is expected to come roaring back next fall and winter if most coronavirus restrictions have lifted by then, experts warn. Because children commonly spread the flu, reopened schools and day-care centers may contribute significantly to the rebound.

That prediction is not just theoretical. Recent data from several countries, including Cambodia, Laos and Bangladesh, showed the flu resurging as coronavirus restrictions were lifted and students returned to schools, Brammer said.

But flu infections and deaths could stay low next season if mask-wearing and social distancing remain common, either because of the coronavirus or because people choose to apply the same measures to influenza prevention.

“I think this has clearly shown that masking, distancing, hand-washing — all these things clearly work,” said Aaron Milstone, an epidemiologist and professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University. “So I think the question will be, how much appetite do people have for all that to prevent influenza, instead of just covid.”

Some experts speculate that next flu season might be particularly harsh. Among other reasons, the near nonexistence of influenza this year has complicated scientists’ efforts to figure out which strain was dominant and might stay prevalent.

Andrea Kovacs, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Southern California, said it’s hard to predict which strains to develop vaccines for next year without data for the current year.

“They may not guess the right strains to make the vaccine against,” Kovacs said.

It also isn’t too late for the flu to surge in the current season if coronavirus restrictions are relaxed. A change in human behavior could make flu cases rise in April and May, when they’re usually decreasing, Brammer warned."

Washington reported 70 deaths during the same time frame last flu season and 114 deaths overall.

Each flu season begins in October and runs for a year, though cases usually peak in the winter months.

Health officials say “similar trends” have been seen nationally and globally, McClatchy News reported. In the U.S., flu activity has been “lower than usual for this time of year,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Precautions in place to help curb the spread of COVID-19 have played a major role in slowing down the 2020-21 flu season, health officials say.

People continue to practice what health officials call the three W’s: wearing a mask, washing their hands often and waiting 6 feet apart, McClatchy News reported.

“The precautions we’re taking against COVID-19, such as washing your hands, staying home when sick, and avoiding others, also help protect you from other respiratory diseases, including flu,” Danielle Koenig, a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Health, told McClatchy News in an email. “Because we’re doing these things far more this year than we typically do, we can see the effects of that!”

Erica Wilson, a medical epidemiologist with the North Carolina Department of Health, also attributed her state’s low numbers to extra precautions people have been taking to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Health officials also noted the importance of an “increased emphasis on maximizing influenza vaccination coverage in order to reduce the burden of influenza-related respiratory illnesses on the public’s health and the health care system,” according to the CDC.

Koenig says more adults have been vaccinated against the flu this season compared to last season.

Over the past year, South Africa has been ravaged by Covid-19. To date, more than 1.5 million cases have been confirmed and more than 50,000 deaths. The true number of cases is likely to be more than 10 million, and we know that the unexplained deaths, most of which are due to Covid-19, sit well above 100,000. With ongoing community transmission and subsequent error-prone viral replication, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 will probably emerge and may favour further transmission.

None of us knows when the third wave will hit, but most of us in public health and science believe our Covid-19 vaccination roll-out will not be quick enough to prevent this nor subsequent waves. If the next wave coincides with the winter respiratory virus season, particularly a seasonal flu epidemic, a double whammy will hit South Africa and its health system.

Influenza kills about 10,000 people five years and older (21.6 per 100,000 person years) each year in South Africa, a relatively small number compared with the past year’s Covid-19 deaths but still a heavy toll. Furthermore, worldwide it causes between three to five million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths.

There is no indication that flu and Covid-19 vaccines interfere with each other, but because both might cause mild reactions, it’s probably best to separate them by two weeks.

Like SARS-CoV-2, influenza is transmitted by hitching a lift on droplets from our upper respiratory tract, and by people transferring virus-carrying droplets by hand from surfaces to their nose, mouth and eyes. Therefore, like Covid-19, it is prevented by masking, physical distancing, avoiding poorly ventilated indoor areas, good hand hygiene and isolating when symptoms occur coupled with testing. The latter is especially important since the clinical illness is very similar to Covid-19.

Perhaps not surprisingly in 2020, in South Africa and abroad, we registered very few confirmed cases of influenza for three main reasons. First, the ultimate form of physical distancing – a hard lockdown – started just as the flu season began. The winter season usually starts in the Western Cape, as do other winter respiratory viral outbreaks. Indeed, a National Institute for Communicable Diseases memo from 9 April 2020 reported an increase in influenza cases in the province from late February to the end of March 2020. This mirrored what we were seeing in our hospitals, with severe cases admitted to intensive care in the first months of the year. However, during and following lockdown, flu cases disappeared from the radar, so the hard lockdown seems to have played a role in cutting off transmission routes for the illness. Lockdown also meant prolonged school closures, and because children are an important base for intense flu transmission, this reduced transmission.

However, when lockdown was lifted we didn’t see an influenza resurgence. This is not just due to lockdown. As already highlighted, like SARS-CoV-2, the flu virus is spread by respiratory droplets, so masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, among other measures, in all likelihood helped avoid a winter flu epidemic in 2020.

Last, because of the fear of a double whammy, a strong push for influenza vaccination uptake was made in 2020. The World Health Organisation recommends that nationally determined high-risk populations should be vaccinated against flu and South Africa publishes yearly updates on which groups should be prioritised. Prioritisation is necessary since fewer than one million doses are procured annually. High-risk groups include pregnant women (at particular risk of severe influenza pneumonia), people with HIV and other causes of immune suppression, people with chronic lung, neurological or cardiac disease, metabolic diseases such as diabetes and morbid obesity, the elderly (65 and older) and healthcare workers. The number of people in South Africa who should be vaccinated against influenza is in the tens of millions, but we can only work with the supply we have. Furthermore, as we are seeing with Covid-19, vaccine hesitancy or a perceived lack of risk mean some vaccine doses are unused.

The absence of a hard lockdown in 2021, the recent move to Level 1, the return to school and our poor compliance with public health protection measures before the second Covid-19 wave, mean SARS-CoV-2 might be joined by flu as winter approaches.

What can you do to prevent the double whammy of Covid-19 and flu? First, continue to comply with public health interventions that have become part of our everyday lives. Second, avoid poorly ventilated indoor areas where people are gathered, which are fertile ground for superspreader events. Third, if you are in one of the risk groups for serious complications of influenza, get vaccinated against influenza and Covid-19 as soon as you can.

There is no indication that flu and Covid-19 vaccines interfere with each other, but because both might cause mild reactions, it’s probably best to separate them by two weeks.

The flu vaccine is inactivated, which means it instructs your immune system to recognise the virus in future, protecting you from serious disease. Due to changes in the structure of the virus over time, current vaccines need to be given every year. Adverse events from the jab are rare and predominantly entail some tenderness at the injection site and, in some people, cold-like symptoms in the following 48 hours. This is not due to influenza infection as the vaccine cannot cause infection. The symptoms relate to the immune system doing its job and supercharging itself for action. Because flu vaccines are produced in eggs, people with egg allergy should not have the inactivated shot and discuss an alternative (live-attenuated).

Third-wave preparedness demands an awareness of the potential harm to the population and health system from a seasonal flu epidemic. Now is the time to strengthen prevention measures, avoid mass gatherings and for the high-risk groups to receive the flu vaccine, which will be rolled out in South Africa from March. DM/MC

""This is the lowest flu season we've had on record,"" the CDC's Lynnette Brammer told the Associated Press.
This was based on the 25-year surveillance the agency has done for each flu season.
This could've potentially led to a mild flu season for 2020-2021, even without Covid-19 circulating and people following mitigation efforts.

But instead flu season has been practically nonexistent in the United States and across the world.

As of 20 February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded just 1,499 positive flu cases since September. Around the same time last year, the CDC had already logged 174,037 positive cases of influenza.

""This is the lowest flu season we've had on record,"" the CDC's Lynnette Brammer told the Associated Press. This was based on the 25-year surveillance the agency has done for each flu season.

In normal years, a flu season could cause 500,000 to 600,000 hospitalisations and 50,000 to 60,000 deaths, depending on the severity of the virus that year. But the United States was seeing nowhere near the infections, hospitalisations, and deaths from influenza this current season.

Several factors have likely contributed to a diminished influenza season amid the coronavirus pandemic, including mitigation efforts like wearing a mask, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.

Dr Robert Finberg, an infectious disease researcher and distinguished professor with UMass Medical School, said the Covid-19 virus could also be directly contributing to lower influenza numbers this season.

""Pandemics typically change the ecology of viruses,"" he said. ""For example, in the 2009 pandemic, which was the last flu pandemic, other viruses like respiratory syncytial viruses were decreased because the population was exposed to the pandemic virus.""

Being exposed to the virus helped the public ""mount an immune response, which sometimes will cause the other viruses to go away or become much less prevalent,"" he added.

His explanation coincided with a 2020 study in the Journal of Medical Virology where prominent health experts hypothesised that the Covid-19 coronavirus could increase immunity for people against other viruses, such as the seasonal flu. In the study, 8,990 people in New York who tested positive for Covid-19 had a lower likelihood of carrying the flu versus people who did not contract the novel virus.

Experts concluded that the novel virus could potentially be ""blocking"" the seasonal flu, but more research was needed before making a final determination.

Around the world, other countries were also recording mild flu seasons. In Japan, there were approximately 800,000 flu patients in January 2020, but the country only saw 1,000 flu patients since the second week of 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported. England has not detected a single case of influenza during the first seven weeks of 2021, according to Public Health England (PHE).

Another factor that could be contributing to the low 2020-2021 flu season in the US was that the previous season saw a high number of infections among the public with an estimated 38 million infections, according to CDC data.

""That was a big season,"" Dr Finberg said. ""It would be expected, in a sense, that this year would be a lower season.""

When more people become infected by the flu in one season, they develop an immunity that helps them fight the virus for a period of time. This could've potentially led to a mild flu season for 2020-2021, even without Covid-19 circulating and people following mitigation efforts.

Flu season was not over yet, though, and Dr Finberg has implored the public to not get too comfortable with the current infection numbers they were seeing.

""In 2015-16, flu season actually peaked in March, so it does vary,"" he said. ""I'm not certain we are out of the woods yet, so I would urge everyone to be careful.""

Experts warned the current mild season, if it continues, should not be what the public expects for the flu in the years to come. Dr Finberg hypothesised the flu could likely come back at normal levels when Covid-19 wanes following the pandemic.

The United States could also experience a severe flu season because so few people have built up antibodies against the virus this current season and mitigation efforts, such as wearing a mask, will be lifted.

Vulnerable communities in future flu seasons could be advised to follow similar mitigation efforts seen during the pandemic like hand washing and wearing a mask to avoid severe illness from influenza.

""I would stress to people not to be too comfortable, not to let their guard down, and to be conscious of getting the flu vaccine in the future,"" Dr Finberg said. ""It could easily come back with a vengeance next year."""

Picture the U.S. struggling to deal with a deadly pandemic.

State and local officials enact a slate of social-distancing measures, gathering bans, closure orders and mask mandates in an effort to stem the tide of cases and deaths.

The public responds with widespread compliance mixed with more than a hint of grumbling, pushback and even outright defiance. As the days turn into weeks turn into months, the strictures become harder to tolerate.

Theater and dance hall owners complain about their financial losses.

Clergy bemoan church closures while offices, factories and in some cases even saloons are allowed to remain open.

Officials argue whether children are safer in classrooms or at home.

Many citizens refuse to don face masks while in public, some complaining that they’re uncomfortable and others arguing that the government has no right to infringe on their civil liberties.

As familiar as it all may sound in 2021, these are real descriptions of the U.S. during the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic. In my research as a historian of medicine, I’ve seen again and again the many ways our current pandemic has mirrored the one experienced by our forebears a century ago.

As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, many people want to know when life will go back to how it was before the coronavirus. History, of course, isn’t an exact template for what the future holds. But the way Americans emerged from the earlier pandemic could suggest what post-pandemic life will be like this time around.

Ready for the Pandemic’s End

Like COVID-19, the 1918 influenza pandemic hit hard and fast, going from a handful of reported cases in a few cities to a nationwide outbreak within a few weeks. Many communities issued several rounds of various closure orders – corresponding to the ebbs and flows of their epidemics – in an attempt to keep the disease in check.

These social-distancing orders worked to reduce cases and deaths. Just as today, however, they often proved difficult to maintain. By the late autumn, just weeks after the social-distancing orders went into effect, the pandemic seemed to be coming to an end as the number of new infections declined.

People clamored to return to their normal lives. Businesses pressed officials to be allowed to reopen. Believing the pandemic was over, state and local authorities began rescinding public health edicts. The nation turned its efforts to addressing the devastation influenza had wrought.

For the friends, families and co-workers of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who had died, post-pandemic life was filled with sadness and grief. Many of those still recovering from their bouts with the malady required support and care as they recuperated.

At a time when there was no federal or state safety net, charitable organizations sprang into action to provide resources for families who had lost their breadwinners, or to take in the countless children left orphaned by the disease.

For the vast majority of Americans, though, life after the pandemic seemed to be a headlong rush to normalcy. Starved for weeks of their nights on the town, sporting events, religious services, classroom interactions and family gatherings, many were eager to return to their old lives.

Taking their cues from officials who had – somewhat prematurely – declared an end to the pandemic, Americans overwhelmingly hurried to return to their pre-pandemic routines. They packed into movie theaters and dance halls, crowded in stores and shops, and gathered with friends and family.

Officials had warned the nation that cases and deaths likely would continue for months to come. The burden of public health, however, now rested not on policy but rather on individual responsibility.

Predictably, the pandemic wore on, stretching into a third deadly wave that lasted through the spring of 1919, with a fourth wave hitting in the winter of 1920. Some officials blamed the resurgence on careless Americans. Others downplayed the new cases or turned their attention to more routine public health matters, including other diseases, restaurant inspections and sanitation.

Despite the pandemic’s persistence, influenza quickly became old news. Once a regular feature of front pages, reportage rapidly dwindled to small, sporadic clippings buried in the backs of the nation’s newspapers. The nation carried on, inured to the toll the pandemic had taken and the deaths yet to come. People were largely unwilling to return to socially and economically disruptive public health measures.

It’s Hard to Hang in There

Our predecessors might be forgiven for not staying the course longer. First, the nation was eager to celebrate the recent end of World War I, an event that perhaps loomed larger in the lives of Americans than even the pandemic.

Second, death from disease was a much larger part of life in the early 20th century, and scourges such as diphtheria, measles, tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, scarlet fever and pneumonia each routinely killed tens of thousands of Americans every year. Moreover, neither the cause nor the epidemiology of influenza was well understood, and many experts remained unconvinced that social distancing measures had any measurable impact.

Finally, there were no effective flu vaccines to rescue the world from the ravages of the disease. In fact, the influenza virus would not be discovered for another 15 years, and a safe and effective vaccine was not available for the general population until 1945. Given the limited information they had and the tools at their disposal, Americans perhaps endured the public health restrictions for as long as they reasonably could.

A century later, and a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is understandable that people now are all too eager to return to their old lives. The end of this pandemic inevitably will come, as it has with every previous one humankind has experienced.

If we have anything to learn from the history of the 1918 influenza pandemic, as well as our experience thus far with COVID-19, however, it is that a premature return to pre-pandemic life risks more cases and more deaths.

And today’s Americans have significant advantages over those of a century ago. We have a much better understanding of virology and epidemiology. We know that social distancing and masking work to help save lives. Most critically, we have multiple safe and effective vaccines that are being deployed, with the pace of vaccinations increasingly weekly.

Sticking with all these coronavirus-fighting factors or easing off on them could mean the difference between a new disease surge and a quicker end to the pandemic. COVID-19 is much more transmissible than influenza, and several troubling SARS-CoV-2 variants are already spreading around the globe. The deadly third wave of influenza in 1919 shows what can happen when people prematurely relax their guard.

About Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine

Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine is available in the United States and some European countries, and will be available in Canada in 2021, for use in adults 65 years and older, and has also been approved in Australia. The vaccine has received marketing authorizations in 25 countries in Europe (under the name Efluelda® outside of the UK) for use in adults 60 years of age and older. The high-dose vaccine has four times more antigen than standard-dose vaccine and is specifically designed to provide superior protection against influenza for older adults.ii Older adults have an elevated risk of pneumonia, heart attack and stroke following influenza and are at the greatest risk of influenza-related hospitalization and death.

Sanofi Pasteur’s High-Dose influenza vaccine has earned recommendations for use over standard-dose influenza vaccine in individual adults 65 years and older by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canadaiii, along with a recommendation for priority use in people 60 years of age and older by Germany’s Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO).iv Fluzone High-Dose Trivalent influenza vaccine demonstrated superior protection against influenza in adults aged 65 and above compared to standard-dose formulationv.

About the Sanofi Pasteur Canadian Facilities



Founded as the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratories and University Farm in 1917, Sanofi Pasteur's Canadian facility has supported numerous scientific breakthroughs while making significant public health contributions. One hundred years ago, the Toronto Site was home to some of the initial research for the discovery of insulin, as well as large-scale commercial insulin production for all of Canada until the 1980s. It also produced a highly accessible antitoxin for diphtheria, the leading public health threat to Canadian children in the early 1900s, and was an important partner in the eradication of polio in North America and smallpox around the world.

In 2018, Sanofi made another historic investment at the Toronto Site, to establish one of the most advanced vaccine bulk manufacturing facilities in the world. At the time, this was the largest investment ever made by Sanofi globally, at approximately €335 million. This manufacturing facility will produce seven antigens: five-component-pertussis, plus diphtheria and tetanus, to help meet global demand for more life-saving vaccines for children and adults worldwide. License approval for the United States and Canada is expected in 2024 for the five-component-pertussis and in 2025 for diphtheria and tetanus.

Sanofi Pasteur’s commitment to improve influenza prevention

As the leading manufacturer of influenza vaccines, Sanofi Pasteur is committed to researching and developing differentiated and proven solutions to protect people of all ages and risk groups against influenza and its complications.

During the 2020-2021 influenza season, Sanofi Pasteur supported health authorities in efforts to strengthen influenza vaccination campaigns in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sanofi Pasteur delivered 20 percent more doses this year, reaching an unprecedented production level of 250 million doses, across its influenza vaccine portfolio. Eight countries in Europe, and Israel, procured Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent in 2020 – through special importation – to provide an additional protection to their older citizens

Sanofi Pasteur produces influenza vaccines each year across five international sites: Swiftwater (Pennsylvania, United States), Pearl River (New York, United States), Val-de-Reuil (France), Ocoyoacac (Mexico) and Shenzhen (China). This makes Sanofi Pasteur the largest manufacturer of influenza vaccines in the world.

The Subcommittee reviewed clinical trial data and a summary of reports of influenza-like illness following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in the WHO global Individual Case Safety Reports database (VigiBase).
The Subcommittee noted that similar symptoms of influenza-like illness had also been reported in the first few days following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials.

These symptoms have been reported in several countries.

The Subcommittee reviewed clinical trial data and a summary of reports of influenza-like illness following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in the WHO global Individual Case Safety Reports database (VigiBase).

The Subcommittee noted that similar symptoms of influenza-like illness had also been reported in the first few days following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials. These included headache, fatigue, muscle aches, feverishness and chills. Most symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days. These expected side effects from vaccination were more common in younger vaccine recipients (under the age of 55 years) compared with older people.

Based on a careful scientific review of the information made available, the Subcommittee came to the following conclusions:

Symptoms of an influenza-like illness may be expected as immune responses following vaccinations in general.

The current reports with the COVID-19 vaccines are consistent with the expected side-effect profile of these vaccines, all of which were well tolerated.

In view of this, the committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines (for which reports of the influenza-like reactions are available to date) remains favourable and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of these vaccines.

The committee recommends that people who are vaccinated be informed, prior to vaccination, of the potential for influenza-like symptoms to occur after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Such symptoms should be managed accordingly, with medical advice sought if required. The occurrence of transient symptoms such as headache, fever and muscle aches after a first dose of these vaccines should not prevent administration of the second dose.

The potential for short-term adverse events following vaccination should be considered when planning the timing of vaccination for healthcare teams or other workers covering a specific service area.

All countries should continue to monitor the safety of vaccines and promote routine after-care following immunization, consistent with good immunization practices for any vaccine. The committee recommends that data on suspected adverse events should be collected and reviewed continuously – nationally, regionally, and globally – as the COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out, world-wide, in order to ensure their continuing positive benefit risk balance.

The GACVS subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary.

The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for the new COVID-19 vaccines, and can be accessed here."

This is the first reported detection of this strain of avian influenza in humans. The human infections occurred on a poultry farm in Astrakhan, Russian Federation, and were reported to WHO by Russian health officials via channels of the International Health Regulations (2005).

Concerns were raised when 101 000 out of 900 000 egg-laying hens on the farm died in early December 2020. An investigation by Russian veterinary public-health authorities detected avian influenza A(H5N8), which was then confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory and the Federal Centre for Animal Health in the city of Vladimir, Russian Federation.

No clinical evidence of onward transmission

Follow-up tests on the 7 workers from the poultry farm suggested recent infection with the virus, though they showed no symptoms. There was no clinical evidence of onward transmission to families or close associates of the workers. Further information on serology among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.

Dr Richard Pebody, who leads the High Threat Pathogen Team at WHO/Europe, was quick to reassure: “The people who were reported to be infected did not develop symptoms and they were all exposed to an infected poultry flock in the course of their work. The infection does not appear to have come from other human beings – which is good news.”

Dr Pebody added, “The poultry flock has been culled and no further infections in humans have been found. It is also encouraging that this incident shows the system that alerts local and international authorities is working. However, this underlines the ongoing importance of global surveillance in the face of constantly evolving influenza viruses. Changes to the influenza virus must be closely monitored in animals and humans alike; this is a good example of the One Health approach, recognizing that human and animal health are intertwined and depend on each other.”

Low risk of human-to-human transmission

Based on available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low and WHO recommendations have not changed as a result of the incident. When avian influenza is circulating in an area, farms and contact with live animals, for example in markets, should be avoided. Precautions must be taken by those working with poultry.

WHO is now following up with public health authorities in the Russian Federation and other relevant organizations. Although this strain of influenza has not previously been known to affect humans, it has been detected in farmed and wild birds in countries across the European Region, including Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and now the Russian Federation."

The risk of avian influenza is high in Germany, according to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI).

The bird flu events have reached a second high point in February, officials note saying the current epidemic in Germany have exceeded those of 2016/2017.

In Germany, around 1,000 HPAIV H5 cases have been detected in wild birds and 133 outbreaks in poultry, six of them in birds kept in zoos or similar facilities, since October 30, 2020.

In addition, a large number of European countries continue to report wild bird cases or outbreaks of HPAIV subtype H5 in kept birds on a daily basis.

The current spring migration of Nordic waterfowl can contribute to the supraregional distribution. Therefore, the risk of spreading in waterfowl populations and entry into poultry holdings and bird populations (e.g. zoological facilities) continues to be classified as high. At present, there is also a high risk of entry through the spread of the virus between poultry holdings (secondary outbreaks). A high poultry density and (outpatient) live poultry trade pose particularly high risks. Biosafety in poultry keeping should continue to be checked and optimized."

This year both influenza and COVID-19 vaccines will be available in Australia. It is important to plan vaccination timing to give the best protection against both of these potentially serious diseases.

There is advice for vaccination providers in the Statement on the relative timing of administering influenza vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines in 2021.

ATAGI does not recommend scheduling and administering an influenza vaccine with a COVID-19 vaccine on the same day. An interval of at least 14 days between a dose of influenza vaccine and a dose of COVID-19 vaccine is advised. This 14 day interval is the same for either the Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine or the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

When scheduling influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations:

People in earlier phases for COVID-19 vaccination should have the COVID-19 vaccine as soon they can, and then plan their influenza vaccination.

People in later phases for COVID-19 vaccination should have the influenza vaccine as soon as they can, and then have the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to them.

People can use the COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Checker to see if they can book a COVID-19 vaccination yet.

When you book patients for an influenza vaccine ask if they have had a COVID-19 vaccine within the last 14 days. Before giving the influenza vaccine, check the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) to see if the patient has had a COVID-19 vaccine.

Mandatory reporting of influenza vaccinations to the AIR

It is now mandatory for all vaccination providers to report flu vaccinations to the AIR. This came into effect on 1 March 2021.

Before giving an influenza vaccine, you should tell the patient that you will report their vaccination details to the AIR. This will include some personal information such as name, date of birth, contact details and some health care identifiers including their Medicare card number.

Public health experts say school closures, remote work and precautions such as hand-washing, masking and social distancing prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic have likely led to the very low number of flu cases, deaths and hospitalizations.

In December, the CDC said a record number of flu vaccinations had been administered after public health officials urged the public to get the flu shot and warned of a “twindemic” of both influenza and COVID-19 straining hospitals.

“I think this has clearly shown that masking, distancing, hand-washing — all these things clearly work,” Aaron Milstone, an epidemiologist and professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, told The Washington Post. “So I think the question will be, how much appetite do people have for all that to prevent influenza, instead of just COVID.”

Health officials have warned, however, that next flu season may be unusually worse, as people aren’t being exposed to influenza this year and more will be susceptible to becoming infected.

As the province continues to roll out its COVID-19 vaccination plan, there are concerns surrounding what will happen once we reach herd immunity and influenza season hits.

“People are going to go back to their normal routines and so we will end up seeing influenza making its way back into the picture,” explains Toronto-based clinical pharmacologist Sabina Vohra-Miller.

“We should be increasing our numbers that we’re getting, what we’re securing this year to at least have that ability to ramp up should the demand exist for even higher.”

Due to the ongoing pandemic and spotlight on vaccines, it’s expected that at least 60 to 70 per cent of Ontarians will want to be vaccinated for influenza in 2021 compared to approximately 40 per cent in previous years.

“Based on this year’s capacity, six million flu shots delivered, we’ve added a significant extra capacity for next year on the assumption people are paying attention to this,” Ontario’s minister of health, Christine Elliott, said during a news conference at Queen’s Park.

“We’ve seen very few cases of flu this year, partly because of people getting the shot and partly because of people continuing to follow public health measures but we anticipate that there will be even more people next year that want to receive the flu shot so we’ve ordered accordingly.”

Traditionally, this is the time of the year when provinces and the country begin to look forward as they acquire vaccines for the coming season, however, it’s unclear how many influenza vaccines Ontario will receive as the national contract continues to be negotiated.

Seniors’ advocates have concerns that people’s drive to get vaccinated will lead to a shortage, similar to what Ontario experienced last fall.

“Unless we have government paying attention to this ordering now, we are going to be right back in another epidemic likely in the fall,” said Laura Tamblyn-Watts, who represents CanAge, a nationally recognized seniors’ advocacy group.

Donnino and colleagues included a total of 1,634 hospitalized patients in their study, 582 of whom had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 1,052 of whom had confirmed influenza. The team found that, on average, 210 patients were admitted to BIDMC during each eight-month flu season, compared to the 582 patients with COVID-19 admitted in March and April 2020. While 174 patients with COVID-19 (or 30 percent) received mechanical ventilation during the two-month period, just 84 patients with influenza (or 8 percent) were placed on ventilation over all five seasons of influenza. Likewise, the proportion of patients who died was much higher for COVID-19 than for influenza; 20 percent of admitted patients with COVID-19 died in the two-month period, compared to three percent of patients with influenza over five seasons.

Further analysis revealed that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 tended to be younger than those hospitalized with influenza. Among patients requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with COVID-19 were on ventilation much longer -- a median duration of two weeks -- compared to just over three days for patients with influenza. Moreover, among patients requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with COVID-19 were far less likely to have had pre-existing medical conditions.

""Our data illustrate that 98 percent of deaths of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were directly or indirectly related to their COVID-19 illness, illustrating that patients did not die with COVID but rather from COVID pneumonia or a complication,"" said Donnino.

The authors note that the stringent social distancing guidance in effect last spring may have impacted these findings by limiting the incidence and lethality of COVID-19 toward the end of April 2020. Conversely, some treatment practices have evolved over the course of the pandemic, potentially improving outcomes for patients with COVID-19."

The European Medicines Agency has published its recommendations for 2021-2022 seasonal influenza vaccine composition.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued its recommendations for the influenza strains that manufacturers should include in their vaccines for the prevention of seasonal flu strains this year.

Manufacturers of egg-based or live attenuated trivalent vaccines for the 2021/2022 season should include these three virus strains:

an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;

an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus;

a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus

Manufacturers of cell-based trivalent vaccines for the 2021/2022 season should include these three virus strains:

an A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;

an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus;

a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus

For quadrivalent vaccines with two influenza B viruses, a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus should be added to the strains mentioned above.

These recommendations apply to the manufacture of both inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines.

To make the recommendations, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)’s Ad hoc Influenza Working Group of the Biologics Working Party (BWP) considered information on international surveillance by World Health Organization (WHO) and Research on Influenza at the UK’s Francis Crick Institute. The recommendations agree with those of the WHO.

The EMA recommends that marketing authorisation holders submit applications to change the composition of centrally authorised seasonal flu vaccines by 14 June 2021."
