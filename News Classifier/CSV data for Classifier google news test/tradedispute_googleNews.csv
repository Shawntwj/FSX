GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States on Monday blocked a decision by Hong Kong to escalate a Trump-era trade disagreement at the World Trade Organization, in its first meeting on disputes at the Geneva-based body since U.S. President Joe Biden’s inauguration.

Speaking at the WTO’s closed-door dispute settlement body, the U.S. delegate opposed Hong Kong’s decision to escalate the dispute by creating a WTO panel to rule on it, according to a copy of the speech.

However, Washington can only block it once and Hong Kong, a member in its own right at the 164-member body, can raise it again at the WTO next month.

The so-called “Made in China” dispute, opened by Hong Kong on Nov. 3, is over a U.S. rule stipulating that goods from the special administrative region of China now be marked as coming from China.

This requirement was announced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in August, breaking with a former policy that allowed Hong Kong to be named as a place of origin.

The closed-door meeting of the WTO’s dispute settlement body on Monday was Washington’s first chance to weigh in on long-standing active trade disputes as well as deadlocked talks over revamping the WTO’s top appeals bench.

Under former President Donald Trump, Washington blocked new judge appointments to the Appellate Body in a bid to force through reforms. However, it signalled no change in its position on the body at the Monday meeting and declined to support a proposal to appoint new judges.

While Biden’s administration has officially taken over trade policy, observers say they do not expect any big changes until after Biden’s trade nominee, Katherine Tai, is confirmed."

• Carrier brands ‘most generous offer in Caribbean’

• Aimed at 63 workers closest to retirement age

By NEIL HARTNELL

Tribune Business Editor

nhartnell@tribunemedia.net

The Bahamas Telecommunications Company’s (BTC) two unions yesterday revealed they have filed a trade dispute over what the carrier branded “the most generous retirement package in the Caribbean”.

Ricardo Thompson, the Bahamas Communications and Public Managers Union’s (BTC) president, told Tribune Business that its attorneys were examining the Enhanced Early Retirement Programme (EERP) being offered to 63 staff aged between 55 and 60 years-old on the basis that the carrier had not complied with their industrial agreement.

He and Dino Rolle, president of the Bahamas Communications and Public Officers Union (BCPOU), which represents BTC’s line staff, argued that the company had made the offer directly to all workers falling into this age bracket rather than going through the two unions first - something they said was mandated by their respective industrial deals.

But Garfield ‘Garry’ Sinclair, BTC’s chief executive, told Tribune Business that the unions were trying to find fault with the process because they were unable to criticise what the carrier was offering to older and long-serving employees.

Asserting that BTC had consulted the two unions at a December 30 meeting, which was confirmed by Mr Rolle, Mr Sinclair emphasised the “voluntary” nature of the package being offered and said the communications provider had set no target number for reducing its workforce.

He added that the deadline for workers to accept the EERP offer had been extended by one week, from January 18 to January 25, to enable all those involved to obtain the details required to make an informed decision on whether they will accept.

Mr Sinclair, who declined to disclose the financial terms on offer, said the number of older BTC staff signalling their acceptance was already “in the double digits”, but both union leaders argued that the offer’s week-long extension was granted because the package was not enticing enough to their members.

“Both unions felt very strongly that BTC’s approach was either a union busting tactic or seeking to destabilise the unions,” Mr Thompson told Tribune Business. “They sought to put things forward and go directly to the members. We have a major problem with that whole process.

“It’s not the way we do business. We are unionised in The Bahamas. You have to come through the unions and negotiate. We may tell you to forget it, and they’re trying to fight us on that. It’s a one-off thing where they’re obviously targeting those 63 persons. There’s no room for negotiation. They want to go directly to the members, and it reeks of union busting and a strategy to disturb the union.

“The persons in this age group have been there the longest, and as a result have salaries that are high. They are obviously targeting long-serving members with high salaries.... We have filed a trade dispute, and are letting our lawyers look at all these things. It’s definitely murky to us, and is not consistent with what we know to be industrial harmony.

Mr Thompson argued that the package being offered to his 23 qualifying members was receiving little response because BTC was offering to pay those who accepted in annual installments, rather than an upfront lump sum.

He revealed that those aged between 55 and 57 were being offered 60 percent of their salary every year for up to three years, together with due pension and other benefits, while those aged 57 and upwards would receive 100 percent of their salary upfront for each of those three years.

Pointing out that BTC has staged numerous voluntary separation exercises since its privatisation in 2011, when Cable & Wireless Communications (CWC) bought a controlling 49 percent equity interest, Mr Thompson said: “Every time there’s an offer of this nature the entire company becomes disturbed. They’re unsure what the final number is, what they will do the next day. Every time they turn they get surprised.”

The union chief added that should all 63 persons accept the latest package, BTC’s workforce would number around 330-340 persons. “There’s a lot of contract workers and temporary workers all over the place,” he added.

Mr Rolle, meanwhile, urged the Government to use its 49 percent interest in BTC to intervene with senior management, CWC and the latter’s parent, Liberty Latin America. He added that the union’s had “forced management’s hand” on the EERP after hearing “talk” that another voluntary separation exercise was planned.

“We had a joint membership meeting, and staff were expressing outrage at management over the New Year’s greeting. The first thing the company decided to do was contact staff and offer separation packages. Something’s wrong with that,” Mr Rolle said.

However, Mr Sinclair rebuffed union concerns and accused them of focusing on process rather than substance. “I would suggest the old maxim: When you cannot define a problem with the policy or initiative itself you kick up a fuss over the process,” he told Tribune Business. “Incontrovertibly this is the most generous early retirement package not just in The Bahamas but the Caribbean.”

Mr Sinclair said the December 30, 2020, meeting with the two BTC unions had not seen the two sides agree on everything but “we got the feedback we needed to ensure within the envelope we could afford we were providing colleagues with the most generous early retirement package in the Caribbean”.

With no workforce reduction target in mind, Mr Sinclair added that BTC had wanted to provide older workers close to retirement with financial “comfort” and options for their future given the ongoing uncertainty produced by the COVID-19 pandemic."

The bilateral relationship between Australia and China last year hit its lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1972, according to former ambassador Geoff Raby.

We're currently in the middle of a trade dispute with Beijing that seems to be expanding to an ever-growing list of Australian export commodities.

And it seems we can't go more than a month without either side doing or saying something that offends the other.

Here's a look back at some of the key diplomatic flashpoints between China and Australia in 2020, and where things might be heading in the new year.

Call for a COVID-19 investigation

Last year marked the first time Australia referred China to the World Trade Organization during a trade war between the two nations, which has largely been seen as a response to Australia's calls for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

Several significant export industries including coal, barley, copper and wine have been impacted by the ongoing trade dispute.

The announcement that Australia would be advocating for such an inquiry was made by Foreign Minister Marise Payne in an interview on Insiders — Prime Minister Scott Morrison doubled down on the new policy days later, saying the World Health Organization needed ""weapons inspector"" powers to investigate the pandemic.

Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 1 minute 17 seconds 1 m 17 s Marise Payne spoke on Insiders, calling for an international probe into the coronavirus.

China viewed Australia's suggestion as an insult: Beijing had been growing increasingly sensitive about the perception that it was to blame for the virus, which was first detected in the city of Wuhan.

Chinese officials have even gone so far as to put forward a conspiracy theory that the virus may have come from the United States.

China's ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned of a potential economic backlash, suggesting there could be a popular boycott of Australian goods in China if Canberra continued to push for an investigation.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham at the time likened this to ""economic coercion or threats of coercion"", and said the Government's position would not change.

We never really got an opportunity to see if there'd be a backlash against Australia by Chinese consumers, with China putting up barriers to a number of significant Australian exports over the following months.

Yun Jiang, editor of the Australian National University's China Story blog and director of the not-for-profit China Policy Centre, said Australia could have ""done it a little bit differently"".

""There are ways that we can demonstrate our concern with China's actions and behaviours in the international system,"" she said.

""We could have first tried to get more like-minded countries on board first to ensure we're not left out alone with our push for an independent inquiry with 'weapons inspector' powers.""

In the end, China did eventually agree to an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 — however it was based on a resolution put forward by the European Union, not Australia.

Meanwhile, analysts say Australia is going to have a difficult time finding a market to replace China in the short term, leaving affected exporters in a difficult position.

China accuses Australia of racism

China last year took the rare step of warning international students about studying in Australia.

China seized on reports of increased incidents of racist abuse in Australia linked to the coronavirus pandemic, warning international students to be cautious about choosing to study in Australia due to the risk.

This was rejected by the Federal Government, which said Australia was popular with international students because of its multiculturalism.

However some ministers even went further, saying China's criticism of reported coronavirus-related racism in Australia had no basis in fact.

When the ABC posted a call-out asking readers to share their experiences of racist abuse during the pandemic, it received hundreds of responses from people all around the country.

Australian officials later walked back their position, saying while racist incidents had occurred, Australia remained a safe place and the vast majority of Australians would be appalled by such behaviour.

Australians abroad in the crosshairs

Australia in July moved to issue its own travel warning, saying Australians in China were at risk of arbitrary detention and warning citizens against travelling there.

This came after China passed a sweeping new national security law for Hong Kong that effectively outlawed many of the activities of the city's anti-Beijing protest movement.

Australia was among around two dozen Western nations that had criticised China over the law, and even moved to offer safe haven visa extensions to Hong Kong residents in Australia.

China issued yet another travel warning in response, alleging that Chinese citizens in Australia had been searched arbitrarily and had their possessions seized.

The Hong Kong issue added another element of tension to the China-Australia relationship, with the Chinese embassy in Canberra labelling Australia's actions a ""gross interference in China's internal affairs"".

Australians travelling to China have previously been detained arbitrarily, the most prominent example in recent times being the writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, who was only formally charged in October after spending almost two years in custody.

But 2020 saw even more Australians in China face pressure, especially in the media sector.

Australian journalist Cheng Lei was working as a high-profile anchor for CGTN, the English-language arm of China's state-run television network CCTV, before her arrest in late August.

Beijing says she is suspected of ""criminal activities endangering national security"". It has not elaborated on those claims.

Shortly after Ms Lei's arrest, the Australian embassy in Beijing warned the two remaining journalists working for Australian news organisations to leave China.

Mike Smith from the Australian Financial Review and ABC correspondent Bill Birtles were both questioned by Chinese authorities in Shanghai and Beijing respectively, as a condition of them being allowed to leave the country.

Birtles, who had been due to fly out of China, said several police officers arrived at his apartment at midnight to tell him he was banned from leaving the country, and needed to be questioned over a ""national security case"".

Both reporters had to shelter with Australian officials at the Shanghai consulate and Beijing embassy.

After the two journalists were able to fly home, China again accused Australia of interfering in its internal affairs by allowing the reporters to take refuge in their diplomatic compounds.

It later emerged that Australian authorities had earlier raided the homes of Chinese journalists in Australia in connection to a foreign interference investigation, which also involved top Chinese diplomats and consular officials.

Australia asks China to apologise over tweet

The tensions between Australia and China took a particularly serious turn when a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted a doctored image showing an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child.

The intention of the tweet was to criticise Australia over the Brereton report, which found Australian special forces had committed at least 39 unlawful killings in Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison took the step of asking China for an apology over the tweet, which he said was ""utterly outrageous and cannot be justified on any basis"".

He also asked for the offending image to be deleted, and said the Government had contacted Twitter to that end too.

Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 1 minute 59 seconds 1 m 59 s Scott Morrison says the tweet from a Chinese Government spokesman was ""repugnant"".

China refused to apologise over the post, saying instead that Australia should do some ""soul searching"" in the wake of the Brereton report.

""They said the Chinese Government should feel ashamed but it is Australian soldiers who committed such cruel crimes,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a press conference.

""Shouldn't the Australian Government feel ashamed? Shouldn't they feel ashamed for their soldiers killing innocent Afghan civilians?""

What's next?

Few people would have predicted the world facing a deadly global pandemic this time last year — forecasting what 2021 is going to look like is similarly fraught with difficulty.

As far as the future of the Australia-China relationship goes, Yun Jiang from ANU was willing to make a few predictions.

""The bilateral relationship is dependent on many factors, and one of them is how other countries treat China,"" she said.

""What we've seen recently appears to be that other powers, such as the European Union who just completed their investment treaty with China, may not be on the same page when it comes to confronting the challenges posed by China.

""If other countries are sending these kinds of signals, the Australian Government may also consider taking a step back as well.""

This could place Australia in a difficult position if it finds itself isolated — but there has also been talk of Australia's Five Eyes allies moving to respond to the ongoing trade spat.

Either way, Ms Jiang does not predict that the current problems are a new normal for the bilateral relationship.

Australia's not the only country to have had trouble with China in the past. ( AAP: Lukas Coch )

Other nations like South Korea and Japan have had episodes of high tension with China, yet have managed to mend ties over time.

Whether there's willingness on both sides to fix the relationship is another issue.

""If both parties are willing to make an effort to fix it, then it can happen,"" Ms Jiang said.

""But right now at this point, it appears both parties are not willing to really come to the table and make an effort in making the relationship into a positive one."""

Jan. 22, 2021– An ongoing trade dispute between Belize and St. Kitts and Nevis has finally been settled. Belize had sued St. Kitts-Nevis, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and CARICOM for allegedly violating the 40% Common External Tariff (CET) by importing brown sugar from countries outside the Single Market without the CET provisions. Belize further alleged that CARICOM had failed in its duty to ensure that the CET was imposed by the countries named in the lawsuit, and that this resulted in Belize Sugar Industries Ltd. (BSI) and Santander Sugar losing a large amount in sales to these countries.

Belize is currently seeking possible legal remedies at the Caribbean Court of Justice, and is calling for the full implementation of the 40% CET on brown sugar imports from non-CARICOM countries, as well as the implementation of a mechanism to monitor the CET, and compensation for unearned revenue due to lost sales.

After being notified of the legal action taken by Belize, the government of St. Kitts-Nevis began discussions with Belize in an effort to come to a possible settlement. The two parties had found resolution through a settlement with conditions appealing to both parties.

Belize’s sugar sector is now guaranteed that it will receive the trade policy support to which it is entitled, inclusive of the application of the CET and an opportunity to fully re-enter the St. Kitts-Nevis market.

This settlement is a victory for the sugar industry of Belize, which has been disadvantaged by the entry of imports from non-CARICOM countries into the CARICOM Single Market, within which only regionally produced sugar should be sold. The lawsuit, however, is still far from over. Belize continues to press the case against the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and CARICOM, hoping to reach resolution, as was achieved in the St. Kitts-Nevis trade dispute."

""While our full year outlook for 2021 is cautiously optimistic, it remains subject to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 effects on the economy and related uncertainties with respect to funding availability for non-residential construction projects,"" Woltz said.

Insteel reported that as of Dec. 31, it had no debt and $50.2 million of cash on hand.

Woltz has said Insteel “continues to contend with the surge in low-priced imports of PC strand resulting from the increased production of downstream products by foreign producers to circumvent the Section 232 tariffs and expand their market share in the U.S.”

In March 2018, the Trump administration put 25% stainless-steel tariffs on Chinese and other imports.

Insteel makes steel-wire reinforcing products largely for infrastructure projects. Steel material represents 70% of the company’s total product costs.

In April, Insteel joined with other domestic PC strand producers in filing anti-dumping petitions against 15 countries, which represented 89% of total PC strand imports entering the U.S. in 2019. A U.S. Commerce Department investigation began in May and is projected to last about a year.

That’s in addition to a countervailing duty petition alleging illegal subsidies against Turkey.

On Thursday, Woltz said the International Trade Commission on Jan. 8 ""ruled in our favor with respect to PC Strand trade cases pending against eight countries, resulting in the implementation of duties on their exports to U.S. markets ranging from 24% to 194% of value.""

Those countries are Argentina, Colombia, Egypt, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.

""We are pleased with this outcome and expect the duties to level the playing field with eight countries that had ignored U.S. trade law in recent years to the detriment of the domestic industry and its employees.""

Woltz said final determinations against seven additional countries ""are expected during our third fiscal quarter."" Those countries are Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, South Africa, Spain, Tunisia and Ukraine.

On June 30, a separate group of domestic producers of standard welded wire reinforcing products filed a trade case against Mexico.

Woltz said Thursday that ""we expect final determinations in our standard welded wire reinforcing trade cases against Mexico before the end of the current quarter.""

Woltz said Insteel is ""hopeful that the new Biden administration and Congress are successful in negotiating an infrastructure initiative that would shore up confidence in these markets and address critical infrastructure deficiencies.""

By Aaron Humes: Things are sweet again, after a fashion, between Belize and the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis, after the countries avoided litigation in a trade dispute over trade in brown sugar.

In the waning days of the Godwin Hulse Ministry of Agriculture, Belize had sued St. Kitts and Nevis, as it is also known, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and the Caribbean Community generally in the Caribbean Court of Justice’s Original Jurisdiction.

Belize accused both federations of importing brown sugar from countries outside the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) without imposing the 40 percent Common External Tariff (CET), costing sales from American Sugar Refining/Belize Sugar Industries Limited (ASR/BSI) and Santander Sugar, and CARICOM of failing to ensure the CET was imposed, facilitating the trade without the tariff.

St. Kitts approached Belize on settling out of court and such a settlement has now been reached on “conditions satisfactory to Belize,” as elaborated in a press statement, but no details were provided. The discussion was carried out between Belize’s Solicitor General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Immigration, and ASR/BSI.

The Government says farmers here can now be assured of proper trade policy support from CARICOM under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas including the application of CET and opportunities to trade directly with St. Kitts and Nevis.

At the time of the suit as we had reported, St. Kitts argued that its Government had not imported sugar and that the sugar in question must have been imported by private businesses.

Trinidad and Tobago fights on and when that case comes before the CCJ, Belize is asking for the following rulings: “…requires the full application of the 40% CET on Brown Sugar imported from non-CARICOM sources; the establishment of the Monitoring Mechanism for Sugar that was approved by the COTED in 2019; implementation of the Monitoring Mechanism once finalized, and compensation for lost sales suffered by the sugar industry of Belize as an economic injury.”

The Government of Belize extends its thanks and appreciation for the support provided by the BSI, Santander Sugar, and the Sugar Association of the Caribbean in the ongoing effort to secure access to the CARICOM market for sugar and to ensure the survival and sustainable development of the sugar industry of Belize.

A dispute between AstraZeneca and the European Commission over deliveries of its vaccine has prompted suggestions that Brussels could restrict exports of EU produced jabs, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech product into the UK and other countries outside the block.

Brussels has come under fire for slow progress of its vaccination programme and is embroiled in a dispute with AstraZeneca, which has said it cannot supply the full amount of jabs into the EU due to issues with its facilities. The jab has yet to be approved by the European Medicines Agency.

Work started in February

Ms Bingham, who headed up the UK’s Vaccine Taskforce told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m not going to get into the details of the contacts but one of the things the CEO of AZ (AstraZeneca) did not mention is that we actually started scaling up manufacture of the Oxford vaccine from February.

“So, yes, we signed the contract, or agreed terms with AZ, in May, but actually the work to scale up the manufacturing started months before that, and it is that early work that was done by the industry – voluntarily, not based on contracts or requirements but a voluntary coalition of the different companies.

“That is what has ultimately made the difference as to why we are so far ahead on manufacturing.”

Asked about AstraZeneca’s dispute with the European Union, Ms Bingham said: “We are interdependent and I don’t think that the idea that there are going to be trade barriers is something that we should be considering.”

UK will help neighboring countries

Junior minister Lucy Frazer said AstraZeneca’s dispute with the European Union is a “commercial matter” but added that the UK will help neighbouring countries “where we can”.

Asked about the ongoing row about supplies, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “That is a commercial matter between AstraZeneca and the EU.

“But we are confident that the supplies that we have put in place with AstraZeneca, which will help us to reach our target of vaccinating everybody by the autumn, we are confident that we will get the supplies for that.”

Pressed on European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reportedly stating that in AstraZeneca’s contract with the bloc it said two out of its four vaccine factories are in the UK, Ms Frazer added: “We have done a great deal of work in the UK to help support the supply chain and the manufacturing base to ensure that we have sufficient supplies within this country.

“But, as I said, our priority is to ensure we vaccinate people in the UK, but of course, where we can help our friends and neighbours, we would do that.”

‘We reject the logic of first come first served’

EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said there have been “constructive” talks with AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot after telling the firm it is contractually obliged to send jabs produced in the UK to 27 EU member states as the bloc faces supply shortages.

Mr Soriot has argued supply chain “teething issues” were fixed in the UK ahead of the bloc because Britain signed a contract three months earlier.

But Ms Kyriakides said: “We reject the logic of first come first served. That may work at the neighbourhood butchers but not in contracts.”

In an interview with Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper, Mr Soriot said “we are basically two months behind where we want to be” in supplies due to manufacturing issues in Europe, citing problems in a Belgian plant.

He said there had been “teething issues” in the UK supply chain as well but that the deal with Britain was signed three months ahead of the EU’s.

“So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced,” he said.

He rejected the suggestion the firm was selling to the highest bidder “because we make no profit everywhere” under the agreement signed with Oxford University.

Feuds between Tesla, Korean gov't deepens over EV incentives



By Nam Hyun-woo



The tit-for-tat between Tesla and the government is escalating after the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker was sidelined from a series of incentive programs on low-emission vehicles here.



Industry officials said Sunday this issue could be elevated into a trade dispute between Seoul and Washington as Tesla claims the administration's move violates the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA).



Last week, the government announced a revision to the country's incentive programs on low-emission vehicles for this year and halved the government incentive on EVs priced between 60 million won ($54,300) and 90 million won. For EVs priced over 90 million won, the government will not provide incentives.



In Korea, the central and municipal governments each offer incentives to registered drivers purchasing EVs. Municipal incentives are set based on those of the central government.



After the revision, a customer purchasing a Tesla Model 3 Long Range in Seoul will get a 5.13 million won incentive ― 3.41 million won from the central government and 1.72 million won from the Seoul Metropolitan Government. This is down 7.37 million won from 12.5 million won last year. The Tesla Model 3 Long Range was the best-selling EV in Korea last year.



""Given that incentives are still a critical factor in EV sales, the revision will likely be a boost for domestic EV makers and brands importing volume models,"" an industry official said. ""It is difficult to rule out the chances of this being amplified into a trade dispute.""



In the revision, the government slashed its incentive cap from 8.2 million won to 8 million won, and lowered incentives given for travel range. Instead, the government increased the amount given for a brand's compliance with government EV initiatives from 200,000 won to a maximum 500,000 won, and added a new criterion for evaluating energy efficiency.



Based on the revision, the Model 3 Long Range comes with a 6.82 million won price reduction, down from 8 million won last year. However, since the vehicle is priced at 64.79 million won, the new price rule is applied, halving the subsidy to 3.41 million won and lowering Seoul city's subsidy too. On the other hand, the buyer of a Tesla Model 3 Standard, which is 54.69 million won, will get a 6.84 million won incentive.



While the Model 3 Long Range faced a drastic cut in incentives, the high-performance Model S was stripped of all of them due to its price range surpassing 100 million won. Along with the Model S, the Mercedes-Benz EQC 400, the Audi e-tron 55 Quattro and the Jaguar I-PACE will also have no incentives.



Tesla buyers claimed 40 percent of the country's 128 billion won in EV incentives allocated for the first half of last year. This led rival firms to claim the incentive program was unfair, saying Tesla ""didn't invest much in the domestic economy"" while its customers here benefited from the incentives leading to increased sales for the company.



They also said earlier that incentives hurt the price competitiveness of cheaper EVs, because they were originally designed to favor vehicles with a longer range on a single battery charge.



Tesla has reportedly expressed concerns to the Ministry of Environment and other related government agencies over the compliance criteria.



These refer to a government regulation on mandating car brands to meet a certain proportion of low-emission vehicles in their total sales. Brands meeting this receive tradable credits, and those that don't are forced to pay a levy or buy credits.



However, this regulation was applied to just 11 brands which sold at least 4,500 vehicles in Korea from 2009, sidelining Tesla from getting benefits from selling credits. Tesla reportedly claimed this was a violation of equitable national treatment guaranteed in the KORUS FTA.



Article 11.3 of the trade pact states: ""Each party (Korea and the U.S.) shall accord to investors of the other party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.""



The environment ministry said the regulation was ""not aimed at discriminating against overseas companies or targeting Tesla,"" but industry officials say the revised incentive scheme appears designed to favor cheaper vehicles.

With the unofficial ban on Australian coal in place, Chinese buyers turned to other major producers to maintain operations.
""As Chinese domestic coking coal reserves are depleted, they are experiencing a reduction in quality so need to supplement this coking coal with imported coal to maintain the correct coal quality for steelmaking,"" Market Intelligence mining analyst Oliver Woolard said.
Other countries in the region offer coking coal of good quality, but only the U.S. has comparable coking coal quality to Australia, Woolard said.
""It is simpler for Chinese buyers to import U.S. coking coal than adapt their processes to accommodate different coking coal quality, hence increasing imports,"" Woolard said.","jump, q420, dispute, australian, shipments, quarter, chinese, 748, 2020, prices, chinas, quality, woolard, coal, coking, trade, amid, imports",tradedispute,Trade Dispute,"China emerged as one of the top importers of U.S. coal in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the country banned Australian coal from entering its territories amid diplomatic tensions.

U.S. coal exports in the three-month period totaled 17.4 million tonnes, down 7.3% year over year but 25.1% higher quarter over quarter, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

China had the highest gain in coal imports from the U.S. among the top destinations in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Asian country imported 1.0 Mt of coal from the U.S. during the period, a 251.8% increase year over year and a 748.2% jump quarter over quarter.

With the unofficial ban on Australian coal in place, Chinese buyers turned to other major producers to maintain operations.

""As Chinese domestic coking coal reserves are depleted, they are experiencing a reduction in quality so need to supplement this coking coal with imported coal to maintain the correct coal quality for steelmaking,"" Market Intelligence mining analyst Oliver Woolard said. ""Although shipments from Australia dropped, Chinese buyers are shifting the balance to other producers of high quality coking coal with the U.S., Canada and Russia benefitting.""

Other countries in the region offer coking coal of good quality, but only the U.S. has comparable coking coal quality to Australia, Woolard said.

""It is simpler for Chinese buyers to import U.S. coking coal than adapt their processes to accommodate different coking coal quality, hence increasing imports,"" Woolard said.

The ban weighed on seaborne coking coal demand in 2020, according to industry observers including Réal Foley, senior vice president of marketing and logistics with Canadian diversified miner Teck Resources Ltd.

Foley noted that it is unclear when the restriction will be lifted. ""In the meantime, what we are seeing and taking advantage of is the price premium for sales into China,"" Foley said during a Feb. 18 earnings call.

Ramaco Resources Inc. founder, Executive Chairman and CEO Randall Atkins recently said the ban created an arbitrage opportunity, which would ""create more pricing positive dynamics"" when lifted.

""China has embargoed any new Australian coals coming in. And as a result, you've got an [arbitrage] that's gone from $60 to $100, I guess, it's about $80 today,"" Atkins said during a Feb. 19 earnings call. ""When that lifts, we believe that there will be not only, of course, a rise in the Australian benchmark, but that will find its way also into a rise on the Atlantic benchmark.""

Dominican Republic was next to China with the highest growth in U.S. coal imports, comprising 502,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2020 for a 115.6% year-over-year increase.

India, the most popular destination for U.S. coal, recorded deliveries of 3.6 Mt during the three-month period, increasing 55.0% year over year and nearly 70% quarter over quarter.

Executives with Pennsylvania-based producer Consol Energy Inc. recently noted that improving petroleum coke prices were a driver in the increase in coal shipments to the South Asian country.

""On the export front, we have seen several very encouraging trends as the seaborne thermal coal markets have steadily improved since the end of the third quarter of 2020,"" President, CEO and director James Brock said during a Feb. 9 earnings call.

Higher prices have allowed Consol to penetrate other markets in India and elsewhere, according to Robert Braithwaite, the company's vice president of marketing and sales. ""With pet coke prices at four-year highs, we're now sending some coal into the cement market as well,"" Braithwaite said during the call.

U.S. coal shipments decreased year over year for 12 of the top 20 destinations in the final quarter of 2020, with the largest declines recorded by Egypt, Italy, Morocco, South Korea and Germany."

Earlier the UK and the EU held talks and agreed to press on with work to resolve the difficulties that have impeded deliveries of goods, notably food, from other parts of the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland and caused some shortages in supermarkets.

The dispute, which was heightened when the EU involved Northern Ireland in a COVID-19 vaccine ban, has cast a shadow over a post-Brexit trade deal agreed late last year and threatens to further sour future ties between the neighbours.

Arlene Foster, the province’s first minister, has previously called on London to walk away from part of the Brexit agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland protocol, but her statement after the talks was pointed in its criticism of European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic.

“It is clear Maros Sefcovic and his team is not serious,” Foster said in the statement, adding it was “time for the United Kingdom government to act unilaterally”.

“With a stubborn and inflexible response from Brussels it is now a matter for the Government to step up and protect the United Kingdom internal market.”

Her words were at odds with a joint statement by the UK and the EU, which suggested there was some movement in the talks to try to resolve the impasse.

“Britain noted that it would provide a new operational plan with respect to supermarkets and their suppliers, alongside additional investment in digital solutions for traders in accordance with the Protocol,” they said.

Britain and the EU said they would meet again.

After leaving the EU last year, Britain agreed a free trade deal with the bloc, but is no longer part of its single market or customs union.

Northern Ireland, which has a land border with EU member Ireland, has a foot in both camps as part of UK customs territory while still aligned with the bloc’s single market for goods.

Under the protocol, which covers post-Brexit trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, supermarkets selling into the territory have a three-month grace period to adapt their supply systems to the new trading reality.

To solve the problem, the British government had demanded concessions from the EU to minimise disruption in trade.

The EU has said it will be pragmatic in seeking solutions, but has blamed the disruption on Britain’s decision to exit the bloc and has called for London to implement measures agreed.

Foster, who attended the online meeting between Sefcovic and Britain’s Michael Gove, who has been responsible for implementing the Brexit deal, told Northern Irish broadcaster UTV the EU had refused a short extension of the grace periods.

But Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, a member of Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein who also attended the meeting, was more positive.

“Both sides restated their commitment to finding practical solutions,” she said in a statement."

Key points: Farmers caught out in Australia's trade dispute with China are finding new markets for their produce

Farmers caught out in Australia's trade dispute with China are finding new markets for their produce The cost of tariffs and the unofficial trade bans is unclear

The cost of tariffs and the unofficial trade bans is unclear Cotton, barley diversify, lobster exporters still face an uncertain future

Barley growers say they are getting good prices from markets in the Middle East and Asia, while wool, wheat and dairy are largely unaffected by the trade bans and, despite impacts on some abattoirs, red meat sales to China remain high.

Cotton growers are also making some inroads in markets including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh and the wine industry has been active in finding new markets.

But the lobster industry has struggled to fill the gap caused by the loss of the China market.

Caution with comments on China

The Department of Agriculture will not say what the cost to farmers has been of higher tariffs and unofficial customs bans across a range of commodities, including barley, beef, wine and cotton.

""China has not imposed sanctions on Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry products,"" a spokesman said.

It is also careful about how it refers to the row:

""Australian agricultural, fisheries and forestry exports faced a number of challenges, including drought, bushfires, COVID-19 and disruptions to regular trade flows for some commodities into the China market.""

The National Farmers' Federation has speculated farmers could lose more than $35 billion over the next decade because of the trade fallout, although it is unclear how the lobby group arrived at the figure.

Signs of recovery for barley exports

Eight months after China introduced hefty tariffs on barley, Australia's largest grain handler, CBH Group, says growers are being paid similar prices to when its most valuable customer was buying.

""For the Australian barley industry, yes it has been a tough 2020, but we're certainly recovering here and prices have recovered to basically the same levels as pre the anti-dumping tariffs,"" CBH Group chief marketing and trading officer Jason Craig said.

Jason Craig from CBH Grain hopes a trial to send barley from WA to Mexico will help fill the void left by China. ( ABC Landline: )

Mr Craig estimated a bumper 13 million tonnes of barley had been harvested across Australia this summer.

He said strong demand from feed markets in the Middle East and Asia and an Australian-first trial to sell premium malting barley to brewers in Mexico had helped to replace lost trade to China.

""Currently it's one shipment of 35,000 tonnes that's worth more than $10 million, so it's an important trial,"" he said.

Red meat still selling into China

Australia continues to sell a lot of farm produce into China.

Exports including, wool, wheat and dairy are so far largely unaffected by the trade spat and, despite some abattoirs being restricted, sales of red meat to China remain high.

In 2020, six Australian abattoirs were suspended from the trade over labelling issues and claims of meat contamination.

A further two meat plants in Victoria are also waiting to resume selling beef and lamb to China after staff were infected with COVID-19, but prices for Australian cattle are at record highs.

Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) managing director Jason Strong said the impact of the tariffs across exports had been minimal.

""Yes, there was disruption, but the material impact on overall exports wasn't that great,"" Mr Strong said.

Australia's recovery from drought has seen the price of cattle soar to record levels, and Mr Strong said, ""finding a home for beef not going to China isn't a major challenge"".

China was Australia's third most valuable market for red meat last year.

""We sent them 197,000 tonnes of beef, so that was the second biggest year by quite a bit that we've sent to China and they were only number three by about 25,000 tonnes less than the US,"" Mr Strong said.

Cotton spreads risk, returns still high

""It's not all doom and gloom"" says cotton analyst Pete Johnson about China's exit from the Australian market. ( ABC Southern Queensland: Nathan Morris )

Cotton growers are also expected to receive high returns for their produce in 2021, as the industry expands into markets across Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

Australian growers and shippers claim Chinese spinning mills were told last October to stop buying Australian grown cotton, and the billion-dollar a year trade essentially stopped.

Toowoomba-based cotton trader and industry analyst Pete Johnson estimated growers would lose a $10-$20 a bale premium without China in the market, but that returns to growers this year were expected to be ""historically high"".

""Would we prefer the Chinese were there to take our cotton? Absolutely, but [we are] spreading our risk into a range of other markets throughout the subcontinent and Asia,"" Mr Johnson said.

""Spreading that risk is ultimately not a bad thing for the industry.

""While the price is good for the growers, and we're able to spread our risk further. It's not all bad news and its not all doom and gloom,"" he said.

Winemakers look to new markets

In the two months since China introduced tariffs on Australian wine, the value of exports fell by $250 million when compared to the same time last year.

The loss of such a lucrative market is disappointing for New South Wales winemaker Bruce Tyrrell, who spent much of last year looking for new customers.

""We're opening markets in the 'Stans'— in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,"" Mr Tyrrell said.

""They're not going to be massive, but they're good markets — wealthy countries building their level of sophistication, so as that happens, wine drinking goes with it,"" he said.

The Australian wine industry will also look to other Asian countries, into parts of Africa and the US.

Mr Tyrrell said 60 per cent of Australian wine is exported, and while it might be nice to think the domestic market could absorb some of the loss, it was unlikely.

""We can drink it all, but I don't think anyone will get much work done, because we'll all be legless.""

Path to recovery not clear for lobster industry

For the Australian seafood industry, which sent almost 95 per cent of rock lobster exports to China, the market is harder to replace.

Louise Hart, who owns a family fishing business on Tasmania's West Coast, says she's been operating at a loss since China stopped buying up last November.

""We're not pinning our hopes on China coming back at all — no,"" Ms Hart said.

Louise Hart hopes other exporters will learn from her industry's experience trading almost exclusively with China. ( Supplied: Louise Hart )

Ms Hart is uncertain about her industry's future when the new year quote begins next month.

""We don't know if we go out fishing. Are the buyers going to be able to sell them at any price at all, or are they just going to sit in their freezers or their tanks. We really don't know,"" Ms Hart said.

""There are a lot of industries in Australia like us, that have been solely reliant on China. It is a big warning to all of those too, find some other markets now,"" she said.

Government looks to EU, UK

Trade Minister Dan Tehan said he hoped new trade agreements with the UK and EU, expected to be established this year, would help exporters no longer trading into China.

""What those free trade agreements will do is provide us with access to another 500 million consumers at cheaper rates for our exporters,"" Mr Tehan said.

The abrupt move by Brazil, home to the world’s third largest planemaker Embraer, comes as larger rivals Airbus and Boeing remain locked in a 16-year-old fight at the WTO that led to tit-for-tat transatlantic tariffs.

While the two giants dominate the market for large passenger jets, Brazil has for years fought its own battles over the regional jet market against Canada’s Bombardier. Their rivalry spawned its own series of mutual trade complaints.

In 2017, Brazil complained to the WTO about Canadian support for the Bombardier CSeries jet, which it claimed had received $3 billion in unfair subsidies.

But the dispute never progressed beyond procedural wrangling and in 2018 the loss-making CSeries was sold to Europe’s Airbus and renamed A220. Canada denies giving unfair support.

“Brazil remains convinced of the strength of its case. Nevertheless, it has become clear that the dispute could not effectively remedy the impacts of such large-scale subsidies on the commercial aircraft market,” Brazil’s foreign ministry said.

It noted the market had changed since Brazil filed its WTO complaint because Airbus was now assembling some A220s in the United States.

Brazil said it would focus “with renewed impetus” on launching negotiations to define more effective rules on government support to commercial aviation.

FINANCING PACT

Embraer welcomed the proposal, which the government said could be based on a successful aircraft financing pact between aircraft producing nations at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2007, and updated 4 years later.

That resulted in caps on export agency financing even as some of the same nations feuded over production subsidies, which have a more visible impact on high-tech manufacturing jobs.

“We believe we should look for something similar on the funding of development and production of commercial aircraft to create a level playing field,” Embraer Commercial Aviation Chief Executive Arjan Maijer said in an interview.

A new U.S. administration and increased public support to help aviation survive the COVID-19 crisis and tackle climate change could spur a deal, he added.

“We are going to see funding come to the market due to Covid and we see environmental challenges ahead of us as an industry, with funding flowing for that as well,” he told Reuters.

Longer term, analysts say there is growing awareness of growing competition from China, increasing pressure for a deal.

U.S. President Joe Biden is seen as more open to multilateral negotiations than his predecessor but for now is holding tariffs in place until a review of Trump-era policies.

William Reinsch, a former U.S. Commerce official and expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Brazil’s move was “a recognition of reality” since the WTO dispute settlement system was not functioning smoothly.

“Even if it pursued the case and won, the remedy is not likely to be helpful to Brazil’s aircraft industry.”

Earlier on Thursday, Airbus reiterated calls for a negotiated settlement to end its long-running spat with Boeing, already the world’s largest corporate trade dispute.

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury called U.S. and European tariffs “lose-lose” and said the time had come to negotiate.

Other parties were not immediately available."

Australian wine makers will need to diversify away from China as the main export market in the long term, as ongoing tariffs stifle trade between the two nations.

Economists and investment analysts are pointing to short-term challenges while the industry attempts to shift product away from the major economy, which for years has been perceived as an exporting cash cow.

China slapped Australian wine with import tariffs of up to 212 per cent last year after Chinese investigators alleged producers were dumping wine into the Chinese market to drive down prices.

The Chinese government has been accused taking the measure to punish Australia calling for a global investigation into the origin of the coronavirus.

A note from investment house Ord Minnett on Thursday revealed wine exports to mainland China for the three months ending December had fallen 98 per cent due to the tariffs implemented on November 28.

“Exports to China will remain constrained as long as the tariffs are in place,” the brokerage said.

“The challenge of reallocating wine previously sold in China to other markets is significant and is expected to weigh on industry margins, with a mix shift to lower margin countries and increased volumes to be sold in Australia.”

Investment bank Goldman Sachs said the impacts of tariffs has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the earnings potential for the country’s largest producer, Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), which is expected to release its interim results revealing the extent of the damage on February 17.

“Given the divergent forces imposing on TWE’s operations (the ongoing anti-dumping investigation and preliminary deposits imposed in China and business restructuring in the Americas), we view the outlook as highly uncertain,” Goldman Sachs said in an investor note.

Despite the challenging short term effects, NAB economist Phin Ziebell said the diversification into other markets would benefit the sector in the long term.

“Being dependent one company or country is always a risk,” he said.

“There is an increasing conversation around diversification, there are alternative markets. (But) the challenge around that is China has just been such a large and profitable market across a number commodities.”



The economist from the major bank flagged producers may have to accept lower prices in other markets in order to move volumes of wine.

A higher Australian dollar, which is expected to hit 80 cents by middle of the year, will also impact the selling price of wine and could be an additional pressure for exporters.

Mr Ziebell said other industries crippled by China’s sanctions had been able to find new markets, such as barley, which has pivoted exports primarily to Saudi Arabia.

“There are clearly alternative markets and diversification is a good strategy for a lot of businesses to have,” he said.

“Long term, the wine industry has a lot of great opportunities. The challenge is moving into those markets and establishing relationships. It takes a long time to establish relationships with importers in various countries.”

Officials in Canberra were left stunned recently after a senior New Zealand minister advised Australia to “show respect” and act more diplomatically toward China, following months of increasing tension between Canberra and Beijing and an agreement to upgrade the Free Trade Agreement between Wellington and Beijing.

In an interview with CNBC, New Zealand’s trade minister, Damian O’Connor, said “I can’t speak for Australia and the way it runs its diplomatic relationships but clearly if they were to follow us, show respect, and speak with a little more diplomacy from time to time and be conscious with wording, than they too could be in a similar situation.”

Australia’s trade minister, Dan Tehan, said the following day that Australia’s relationship with China was “based on an assessment of our national interests” and that his government’s approach to trade policy with China would be guided by “proactivity, principle and patience.”

Australian MP and former diplomat, Dave Sharma, tweeted: “Expected a little more… so much for Trans-Tasman solidarity.”

Sharma later told the Sydney Morning Herald that the advice from New Zealand was not “particularly insightful or helpful.”

“The idea that Australia’s tone or wording is somehow responsible for challenges in our relationship with China is one we fundamentally reject and is at odds with reality,” he said. “It betrays a lack of acquaintance with basic facts that I would not expect from a close friend and partner like New Zealand.”

Others noted how closely O’Connor’s comments echoed Chinese government complaints about and demands of Australia.

China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper seized the moment to deepen the rift by stating that New Zealand and Australia’s approaches toward China were as different as “fire and ice,” accusing Canberra of harboring a “cold war mentality” while Wellington was “relatively open toward the rise of China.”

Dr. Jeffrey Wilson, a trade expert and research director of the Perth USAsia Center told the Guardian that by O’Connor “echoing comments made in the Global Times, the New Zealand trade minister is deliberately criticizing Australia to play to a Chinese audience.”

O’Connor eventually attempted to walk back the comments he made during a phone call with his Australian counterpart and in a statement provided to NZ news site Stuff.

“The Australia-China relationship will always be a matter for China and Australia,” O’Connor said. “I’ve spoken with my Australian counterpart earlier today to reiterate, as I said in the interview, that we do not speak for Australia on this or any other matter.”

O’Connor’s comments are the latest in a series focused on Canberra’s trade dispute with Beijing. New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta also faced resistance from Australian officials last month after she offered to mediate a truce between Australia and China, stating that both parties needed to “concede in some areas where they are currently not seeing eye to eye.”

China is Australia’s largest two-way trading partner, but relations have deteriorated to their worst state in decades after Beijing slapped tariffs on more than $20 billion worth of exports including Australian barley, wine, cotton, coal, and beef.

China is also New Zealand’s largest two-way trading partner. The two countries have just signed an updated free trade agreement that will see tariff-free access for about 99 percent of New Zealand’s nearly NZ$3 billion wood and paper trade to China, reduced compliance costs for New Zealand exports, new and expanded market access for both countries, and increased visa quotas.

China watchers claim that Wellington’s China policy puts economic benefit above democratic values.

“There is a longer-term problem O’Connor’s silly comments feed into: the idea that New Zealand still sees China as a lovely big market and is blissfully unaware that China has been busy coercing some of Australia’s and New Zealand’s partners in the South China Sea and that under Xi Jinping, China’s human rights record from Xinjiang to Hong Kong is objectionable,” said Robert Ayson, professor of strategic studies at Victoria University in Wellington.

It isn’t only officials in Canberra that are bothered by New Zealand’s foray into Australia-China relations. Activists have raised eyebrows as well.



Phil Lynch, director of the International Service for Human rights and former director of Australia’s Human Rights Law Center, said he was proud of Australia for standing up to China.

“I’m actually really proud of the Australian government’s consistent and strong approach to human rights in China,” he tweeted. “Perhaps the New Zealand Government should be less craven and unprincipled on China and share the burden a little more.”

Elaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted “If ‘speaking with more diplomacy’ = silence on China’s human rights violations then that’s exactly what President Xi wants. Note – New Zealand did not join the Jan 10 joint statement on arrests in Hong Kong with Australia, Canada, the UK and the US.”"

French President Emmanuel Macron suggested to President Joe Biden two weeks ago that the countries seek a negotiated settlement in the Boeing-Airbus conflict over aircraft manufacturing that has lasted nearly two decades, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Biden, according to the person familiar with the call, said the relevant teams would follow up but was noncommittal on the outcome. Efforts to reach a resolution have been underway for some time.

French President Emmanuel Macron suggested to President Joe Biden two weeks ago that the countries seek a negotiated settlement in the Boeing-Airbus conflict over aircraft manufacturing that has lasted nearly two decades, according to a person familiar with the matter.

""Airbus supports all necessary actions to create a level-playing field and continues to support the EU's commitment to finding a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs,"" Airbus said in an e-mailed statement.

The White House could not be reached for comment before publication. A representative for Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

""We know there is great interest in resolving the Boeing-Airbus dispute on both sides of the Atlantic, and USTR looks forward to working with our European allies to find an outcome that levels the playing field once Ambassador [Katherine] Tai is confirmed,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative told CNBC.

Since 2004, Boeing and Airbus have been embroiled in a legal battle over what each side sees as unfair tax subsidies provided by Washington state and the European Union.

The World Trade Organization has ruled favorably for each side at different stages, issuing orders for the United States and European Union to offset their rival's benefit by levying tariffs on a total of $11.5 billion in goods. Each side has since moved to roll back the tax subsidies at the heart of the dispute.

""There's really nothing left but to reach a deal,"" said Marjorie Chorlins, senior vice president of European affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""The last administration made a good faith effort to resolve these issues but didn't close the deal.""

Beyond that, the Covid pandemic has soured demand for air travel and, by extension, purchases of large civil aircraft – further exacerbating the impact on two manufacturers that have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees since the dispute began.

The floating of a potential settlement by Macron signals how high a priority it is for France and the EU as they eye a reset of trans-Atlantic relations under the new administration.

""Our aim is to find solutions to our ongoing trade disputes, including on Airbus/Boeing,"" said Sophie Dirven, a spokesperson for the European Commission.

Biden, likewise, has pushed to reset diplomatic relationships with allies following the contentious Trump years.

The decision on whether to move forward with a settlement would land on the plate of the USTR, which had previously enacted tariffs on $7.5 billion in European goods, including German machinery, Italian cheese and French wines.

In recent days, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has announced a slate of staff appointments as it awaits a confirmation hearing for USTR nominee Katherine Tai, expected to take place the week of Feb. 22 at the earliest.

Officials have raised the issue with other Cabinet members who have been confirmed.

In a Jan. 28 phone call between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Le Maire ""insisted in particular on the very penalizing nature of the sanctions for French winegrowers,"" according to the readout from Paris.

The remarks by Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director David Vigneault mark the second time in a few months that Ottawa - mired in a broad diplomatic and trade dispute with Beijing - has identified China as a problem actor.

Vigneault told an online forum that hostile activity by state actors seeking among other things to purloin business secrets and sensitive data “represents a significant danger to Canada’s prosperity and sovereignty” and singled out China.

“The government of China ... is pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts – economic, technological, political, and military – and using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty,” he said.

The biopharmaceutical and health, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, ocean technology and aerospace sectors were most at risk from state-sponsored hackers, he said.

China regularly denies it is trying to steal secrets.

Vigneault also said China had used its Operation Fox Hunt - a search for what Beijing says are corrupt officials and executives who have fled abroad with their assets - to routinely threaten and intimidate political opponents in Canada.

“These activities ... cross the line by attempting to

undermine our democratic processes or threaten our citizens in a covert and clandestine manner,” he said.

OMAHA (DTN) -- Imported phosphorus fertilizer could become more expensive after the U.S. Department of Commerce took a step this week towards putting tariffs on product from Russia and Morocco.

The tariffs recommended for imported phosphorus would raise the costs anywhere from 9% to 47%, depending on the supplier, for a market amounting to roughly $1 billion annually.

The potential duties come after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced on Tuesday it has determined phosphorus fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia are unfairly subsidized through unfair loans, tax breaks and other methods in those countries.

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) is also investigating and is expected to hand down a decision in March. If USITC reaches the same conclusion as Commerce Department officials, then countervailing duties will be issued and put in place for five years.

The U.S. Department of Commerce calculated a subsidy rate of 19.97% on Moroccan producer OCP, while rates of 9.13% and 47.05% were established for Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem, according to a Mosaic news release Wednesday. All other producers will see a rate of 17.2%.

The U.S. in 2019 imported 2 million metric tons of phosphorus from Morocco -- up about 11% in volume -- totaling $729.4 million, which was down about $41.6 million in value from 2018. Phosphorus imports from Russia in 2019 were 767,288 metric tons, down about 18% from 2018, or about $299.4 million.

MOSAIC FILES PETITION

The Mosaic Company, the largest phosphorus producer in the U.S., filed petitions last June with the U.S. Department of Commerce and USITC to request the start of countervailing duty investigations into imports of phosphorus from Morocco and Russia, according to Rabobank Farm Input Analyst Samuel Taylor. Mosaic maintains foreign subsidies are unfair and these duties would restore competition in the U.S. market.

On the other side of the issue is Moroccan fertilizer giant OCP. The fortunes of OCP have a major effect on the economic well-being of Morocco as OCP alone makes up about 5% of the GDP of the North Africa country, Taylor said."

The appeal pushes the case into legal limbo along with some 18 others, several of them involving the United States, because the WTO lacks a functioning appellate body.

The U.S. decision on whether to comply with the recommendation on the South Korea duties or lodge an appeal had been seen as an early indicator of U.S. President Joe Biden’s approach to the WTO and its dispute settlement system.

Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. administration blocked appointments to the appeals body, leaving it with too few adjudicators to rule.

The U.S. mission in Geneva did not immediately comment on the appeal.

A WTO panel recommended in January that the duties on South Korea - imposed on four grades of steel in 2016 and on large power transformers in 2012 - be revised.

The three-person WTO panel found that the U.S. Department of Commerce failed to take into account all the information available when it calculated the level of dumping or subsidies.

The tariffs on transformer makers Hyosung Heavy Industries Corp and Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems Co and steelmakers from Hyundai Steel and POSCO were inconsistent with WTO rules, the panel said.

The case was later joined by the European Union, which said steel producers from several EU member states had also suffered from Commerce Department practices.

South Korea however failed to convince the panel that U.S. authorities had an “unwritten measure” of using the most adverse facts available in order to maximise duties, where an exporter had failed fully to cooperate."

The Philippines first complained in 2008 of Thailand’s customs valuation of Philippine cigarette exports. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has since ruled in favor of the Philippines.

The Trade department has been requesting authorization from the WTO to suspend tariff concessions on Thai exports to the Philippines, in retaliation against Thailand for non-compliance with the international organization’s ruling. The Philippines has initiated domestic procedures, with the Tariff Commission in January conducting a public hearing in which it presented 112 proposed product lines on which concessions could be suspended.

In a news conference Thursday, Trade Undersecretary Ceferino S. Rodolfo said that the Philippines agreed to a time-bound process in Geneva to come up with a “comprehensive solution.”

“Gusto natin time-bound ‘yun. (We want a time limit on talks) After a specific date, tama na (it should end). Kung wala pa rin (If there is no result), we go back to the dispute settlement body.

“The Philippines remains ready, following WTO rules and procedures, to initiate the process for suspension of concessions. In particular the domestic processes for this — for instance the Tariff Commission had already undertaken public consultations on the coverage of products or tariff lines which may be subject to a suspension of concessions should a need arise.”

Any point of engagement with Thailand on this matter will be considered progress, Mr. Rodolfo said.

“It’s important that we maintain a credible and realistic threat to trigger a WTO-rules compliant suspension of concession, because that is important for us to be able to forge a comprehensive solution, for example through the facilitator-led process.”

Industry representatives from both the Philippines and Thailand during the Tariff Commission’s public hearing appealed against the potential suspension of tariff concessions, warning of regional supply chain disruptions and increased consumer prices in the Philippines. — Jenina P. Ibañez"

American whiskey makers have been caught up in the trans-Atlantic trade dispute since mid-2018, when the EU imposed tariffs on American whiskey and other U.S. products in response to Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on European steel and aluminum.
American whiskey exports to the UK, the industry's fourth-largest market, have fallen by 53% since 2018, it said.
Amir Peay, owner of the Lexington, Kentucky-based James E. Pepper Distillery, said American whiskey has become “collateral damage” in the trade disputes.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A hangover from Trump-era tariff disputes could become even more painful for American whiskey distillers unless their entanglement in a trans-Atlantic trade fight is resolved soon.

Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey were left out of recent breakthroughs to start rebuilding U.S. trade relations with the European Union and the United Kingdom in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency. Tariffs were suspended on some spirits, but the 25% tariffs slapped on American whiskey by the EU and UK remain in place. And the EU's tariff rate is set to double to 50% in June in the key export market for U.S. whiskey makers.

A leading spirits advocate is imploring top U.S. trade envoy Katherine Tai to not leave whiskey producers behind. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States urged her to press for an immediate suspension of the European tariffs and to secure agreements removing them.

“Swift removal of these tariffs will help support U.S. workers and consumers as the economy and hospitality industry continue to recover from the pandemic,” the council said in a recent statement after Tai was confirmed by the Senate.

American whiskey makers have been caught up in the trans-Atlantic trade dispute since mid-2018, when the EU imposed tariffs on American whiskey and other U.S. products in response to Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on European steel and aluminum.

Since then, American whiskey exports to the EU are down by 37%, costing whiskey distillers hundreds of millions in revenue between 2018 and 2020, the council said. American whiskey exports to the UK, the industry's fourth-largest market, have fallen by 53% since 2018, it said.

The tariffs amount to a tax, which whiskey producers can either absorb in reduced profits or pass along to customers through higher prices — and risk losing market share in highly competitive markets.

Amir Peay, owner of the Lexington, Kentucky-based James E. Pepper Distillery, said American whiskey has become “collateral damage” in the trade disputes. It's cost him about three-fourths of his European business, and the looming 50% EU tariff threatens to drain what's left.

“That could possibly end our business in Europe as we’ve known it over the years,” Peay said in a phone interview Thursday.

He's already curtailed some whiskey shipments to Europe as a hedge against the potential doubling of the EU tariff. His distillery’s signature bourbon and rye brand is James E. Pepper 1776.

Peay spent years and significant money cultivating European markets, especially in Germany, France and the UK. He was planning to double his European business before the trade disputes hit.

""The way things are going, everything that we invested to date looks like it could be destroyed,” he said.

The tariffs have hurt spirits industry giants as well.

“We estimate that our company ... has borne roughly 15% of the entire tariff bill levied against the U.S. in response to steel and aluminum tariffs,” Lawson Whiting, president and CEO of Louisville, Kentucky-based Brown-Forman Corp., said recently. “They have become a big problem for us and it’s imperative that we get it resolved as soon as possible.”

Brown-Forman's leading product is Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, a global brand.

For Kentucky bourbon producers, tariffs slashed their exports by 35% in 2020, with shipments to the EU plummeting by nearly 50%, the Kentucky Distillers’ Association said.

The EU had traditionally been the largest global market for Kentucky distilleries, accounting for 56% of all exports in 2017. It’s now about 40%, the association said.

“Our signature bourbon industry has sustained significant damage for more than two years because of a trade war that has nothing to do with whiskey,” KDA President Eric Gregory said. “And it will get much worse if we can’t deescalate this dispute.""

Kentucky distilleries craft 95% of the world’s bourbon supply, the association estimates.

The thaw in the U.S. disputes with the EU and UK were part of an effort to resolve a longstanding Airbus-Boeing dispute. The tariff suspensions applied to duties that had been imposed on some spirits producers on both sides of the Atlantic. But the breakthroughs left plenty unresolved, including disputes that led to the retaliatory tariffs still hitting American whiskey.

The suspended tariffs mean some European spirits producers can ship their products into the U.S. duty free, while American whiskey makers are still subject to tariffs, Whiting said.

“We just want a level playing field for American whiskey,” he said."

Overall trade between the two nations is down just 2 per cent in value, with the situation propped up by strong demand for Australian iron ore.

But as soon as iron ore value is removed from the equation, the full and stark extent of retaliatory trade tariffs imposed by Beijing becomes crystal clear.

Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade shared the bleak assessment in a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra, under questioning from Labor's Senate leader Penny Wong.

The figures reflect trade in the second half of the 2019 calendar year compared to the last six months of 2020.

Officials said the situation was still concerning, even taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on global trade.

Australian trade to the rest of the world only dropped by 22 per cent in value during the virus-fuelled economic downturn.

""We just get a sense of, well, this is much bigger than the overall impact of the global economy – is that a fair way to say it?"" Senator Wong asked.

""That is a fair way to say it,"" DFAT's Jennifer Gordon replied.

Australia and China have been locked in a serious trade dispute, with Beijing slapping Australian wine and barley with severe tariffs, and blocking imports of products including lobsters and cotton.

DFAT confirmed there were around 40 ships carrying Australian coal stranded off the coast of China, following restrictions on thermal and metallurgical coal.

Thermal coal exports to China were down 70 per cent in the six months to January 2021, while metallurgical coal had dropped 60 per cent.

Coal exports dropped 83 per cent when comparing the figures from the December quarter of 2019 to the December quarter of 2020.

DFAT secretary Frances Adamson said some of the ships had been there for ""several months"".

""It's been a really long time,"" DFAT's Elly Lawson added.

Dr Gordon noted Australian coal exports were only down by 8 per cent, given an increase in demand from countries including India and Japan.

Barley exports to China were described as ""negligible"", but ""bumper crops"" had led to an increase in exports elsewhere.

Wine has also suffered considerably.

""Wine exports have fallen to less than a million dollars in January 2021,"" Dr Gordon told the hearing.

""We exported $164 million worth of wine to China in October [2020], which was higher than normal because there was warning of the trade sanctions being applied, so there was a bit of a stockpiling effect.

""But since then, unfortunately, we haven't been able to divert as much wine to the rest of the world, so there is a net cost to the wine industry — so it's not the success story of barley.""

The tariffs are likely to be up to almost 220 per cent for the next five years The Australian wine industry says while it's disappointed, it is not surprised

An increase and extension to tariffs on some Australian wine producers paves the way for a World Trade Organisation dispute.

Reuters on Friday reported China's Ministry of Commerce had confirmed it would impose ""anti-dumping measures on some Australian wine imports from March 28 for five years"".

The ministry said importers bringing in wines related to anti-dumping activities, as set out by China, would pay tax to the customs authority, Reuters reported.

China last year introduced interim tariffs of up to 200 per cent, claiming Australian winemakers sold wine below the cost of production and had been subsidised.

Australian Grape and Wine chief executive Tony Battaglene earlier said he expected Beijing to lock in tariffs of almost 220 per cent for the next five years.

Mr Battaglene said an extension of the interim tariffs would confirm the industry's most valuable market was off limits.

""We're probably up to the 215 to 218 per cent mark,"" Mr Battaglene told the ABC.

""Honestly, it doesn't matter. When you're at 200 per cent you're not viable and when you're at 215 per cent, you're even less viable so the market remains closed to Australian wine.""

Once the tariffs are confirmed, it would allow for Australia to refer the dispute to the independent umpire, the World Trade Organiation (WTO).

""We continue to reject the allegations,"" Mr Battaglene said.

""For us, China is someone who continually promotes the importance of the World Trade Organisation, so we'll certainly evaluate very carefully the possibility of challenge through that.

The industry is expected to make a recommendation to the Australian government over pursuing WTO action in the coming weeks.

""My view is we will probably go through the proper channels because we reject the allegations,"" he said.

It follows a decision by former trade minister Simon Birmingham late last year to refer China to the WTO over its application of hefty tariffs on Australian barley for similar allegations of anti-competitive behaviour.

Mr Battaglene said, while disappointing, he believed winemakers would appreciate certainty about the trade, worth more than $1 billion last year.

""At least now we know what is happening, at least the industry can get on with the job,"" Mr Battaglene said.

""We're immediately seeing some impact on price for grapes, we're in the middle of vintage, and we're seeing a 10 to 15 per cent reduction on red wine prices across the board, in some cases a bit more.""

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials told Senate Estimates the value of Australian trade with China for almost all industries has plummeted by 40 per cent since a trade dispute ramped up between the two countries.

And that wine exports had fallen to less than $1 million in January, from a high of $164 million last October.

""We're all about looking forward,"" Mr Battaglene said.

""We know we're going to have a tough couple of years. The real pressure has come on those people who solely export into China and we have 1,000 businesses set up to do that.

""A lot of established businesses will have a hit, yes. It will be tough, but we've seen good support from the Australian people and we hope that continues.""

Federal Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the government rejected any suggestion Australia's wine industry was subsidised.

""The government will be extremely disappointed if China makes a final determination to impose duties – we are not aware of any evidence that Australian wine has been dumped or injuriously subsidised in the Chinese market.

""The government will continue to work closely with the Australian wine industry, including on possible next steps in the event that final duties are imposed."""

The lobster farmers of Australia have more in common with the pineapple growers of Taiwan than they realise. In Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen’s government remains untouchable in the polls. It wants to remain separate from Beijing despite the growing military, economic and political threats from the superpower, which views it as an “inalienable part” of the mainland.

Frustrated by the lack of public and political appetite for its One-China policy, Beijing sent dozens of warplanes towards its island neighbour in the first months of this year. Then it banned Taiwan’s pineapple exports. Like Australia, the official reason given by Chinese customs was for technical infringements. Authorities said pests were found in exports or enhanced COVID-19 testing was blamed. But both the Australian and the Taiwan governments deny these claims and say they are part of a pattern of economic intimidation. “Taiwanese have spontaneously purchased domestic pineapples to reaffirm our solidarity,” says the mayor of Tainan City Council, Huang Wei-che. The area is home to the second-largest number of pineapple exporters in Taiwan. There is pineapple in soup, pineapple wine, pineapple tarts and #FreedomPineapple, the hashtag used on Twitter by Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu to whip up a surge of consumer nationalism. “I urge like-minded friends around the globe to stand with #Taiwan & rally behind the #FreedomPineapple,” he said on Twitter in February.

The hashtag was itself taken from the fourth Australian export out of half-a-dozen last year to be hit by Chinese trade restrictions: #Freedomwine. Australia’s $2 billion-a-year wine trade with China was knocked out last year by tariffs of between 100 and 200 per cent over allegations it had been dumped at discount prices in the Chinese market. The Australian industry and the government have refuted those claims. This weekend, China extended tariffs on some Australian wines for another five years.Chinese officials said the taxes - expected to be up to 220 per cent - were an anti-dumping measures. Huang says it is time to trade more Penfolds and lobster for pineapple. “In my opinion, it will certainly be a win-win situation if countries with a common vision can share with each other’s signature products,” he says. Chung-Hsiu Hung, the chairman of Taiwan’s agricultural peak body, Mitagri, says if Chinese authorities don’t want to allow the imports of Australian wine and lobster, “we will eat it!”

“The more unreasonable the restrictions the more it will summon the consumers together,” he says. “The pineapple saga tells us, ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’ and the risk resilience for the industry is a crucial issue and challenge we need to cope with.” Fiona Fan, the director-general of Taiwan’s de facto consulate, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Sydney, says the trade disruptions have left many Australian and Taiwanese exporters in a state of uncertainty. “As both are staunch supporters of free trade and market economy, Taiwan and Australia could work together to maintain the well-functioning of the multilateral trading system,” she says. But for all the best intentions Taiwan-Australia food diplomacy remains beset by structural difficulties.

Two trade-dependent island countries, similar in disposition and population, find it impossible to meet for dinner at the highest levels because of the great power games going on around them. Taiwan is Australia’s 10th largest export market but there is no free trade deal with the island. Nor is there one on the horizon. A formal deal that could effectively recognise Taiwan as a separate trading nation would deepen tensions with Beijing in an already fraught environment. Diplomats on both sides are cognisant of this and are working privately to boost trade without official statements. But the lack of a formal agreement has seen Australian wine take only 12 per cent of the market where European and US wine dominate. Six tonnes of fresh Taiwanese pineapple are scheduled to arrive in May but overall, trade negotiations between the two Indo-Pacific democracies remain at the margins. “We’ve got a very strong economic relationship with Taiwan,” says Australia’s Trade Minister Dan Tehan. “I can see no reason why that can’t continue.” Trade Minister Dan Tehan says the solidarity expressed by Taiwan, the US and Europe in Australia’s trade difficulties with China was encouraging.

He said that while trade deals with Europe, the UK and Israel were a priority, the solidarity expressed by Taiwan, the US and Europe in Australia’s trade difficulties with China was encouraging. In his strongest public comments on the Australia-China relationship since taking office, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday singled out China for its “blatant economic coercion of Australia” and said it threatened the collective security and prosperity of the international system. Tehan says there has been “a lot of empathy from countries globally because people think that there seems to be some unfair targeting going on”. “We need to be reassured that other countries are looking at what’s happening and thinking that this isn’t how countries should behave towards each other,” he says. Loading

The Australian government has also been attempting to navigate the complexities of a changing relationship with China while those who have the most to lose, businesses, wear the economic hit. Australia’s ambassador to Beijing, Graham Fletcher, told an Australia-China Business Council meeting on Thursday that the two countries were in a “stand-off” and the public nature of the dispute had made it hard for either side to back down. “I’m not sure China realises the damage that is occurring both in Australia and internationally. It’s been exposed as quite unreliable as a trading partner and even vindictive,” he said. The Coalition - conscious of the potential for an electoral blowback on its China policy after taking decisions to block Chinese telecommunications provider Huawei, restrict foreign investment deals and call for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus - has been briefing industry throughout. It is vulnerable to attacks from Labor, particularly in WA (home to Australia’s largest rock lobster farms) where Labor’s trade spokeswoman Madeleine King has been critical of Australia’s China trade policy. The Coalition can not afford to lose one seat at the next election or it will lose majority government.

Papacosta, whose seafood members are among the most exposed in the country to retribution from China and has fewer readily available alternative markets, says the government had been direct in its consultation. “They are not just sending messages down the line,” she says. “They have been very clear on their position. That helps as an industry when you are planning your approach or pivoting. Loading Tehan says he has been “upfront and honest” with businesses about what Australia was trying to achieve. “It’s actually been quite humbling for me because there have been businesses that have been hurt,” says Tehan. “But they’ve understood that ultimately we’ve got to protect our sovereignty, and we’ve got to protect our national interests.”"

Norway-China FTA talks anticipate post-Covid economic recovery

Norway and China held a video conference on March 11, 2021, between their chief trade negotiators, with a view to concluding a free trade agreement (FTA) in the near future. The negotiating parties conducted in-depth consultations on trade in goods and services, investment protections, rules of origin, customs procedures and trade facilitation, sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, dispute settlement, and the preamble to the agreement. Both sides stated that the discussions were held on the basis of achieving a common consensus on as wide a range of economic issues as possible.

Both countries also reiterated that their negotiations for a free trade agreement were important in jointly combating the global coronavirus pandemic and restoring growth in a post-pandemic world. Towards achieving this outcome, they placed importance in supporting free trade and multilateralism, strengthening bilateral economic and trade cooperation, and maintaining the stability of global industrial supply chains. Additionally, Norway expressed its interests in expanding cooperation with China on boosting cross border flows of direct investment, including into key energy sectors, such as hydropower and offshore oil and gas development.

New food agreements post-deep freeze in relations

The Norwegian government had earlier signed an agreement with China to enable the importation of salmon and other seafood, including fish oil and fish meat, into the country’s growing market for northern European food products – where the yearly increase in seafood consumption alone exceeds Norway’s entire annual production in this sector. This market access accord for Norway’s seafood products is typically renewed on a two-year basis and should enable a more stable platform for Norwegian salmon and fisheries until a more comprehensive FTA is finally concluded.

The increasingly constructive bilateral economic ties, over the last four years, come after an extended period of frozen diplomatic relations from 2010 to 2016. This involved no political contact between the two powers following Norway’s Oslo-based Nobel Committee awarding the Peace Prize to China’s Liu Xiaobo in 2010 after Liu was convicted of sedition in attempting to overthrow the Chinese government. The normalizing of economic and political relations since that time could be interpreted as a sign of how any European country’s ties with China can resume on a more constructive track, following several years of frozen normalized relations driven by political differences.

Norway’s expanding ties with ASEAN states through EFTA

Norway has also been formalizing its economic and trade relations with other major Asian economies through its membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. For instance, at the end of 2018, EFTA had signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Indonesia. The Southeast Asian state is the largest economy in the 10-member grouping of nations known as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a bloc that is expected to become the fourth largest economic region in the world by 2030, according to some European governments’ forecasts, while Indonesia is anticipated to reach that level as a sole economy by 2050, according to estimates by international consultancy, PwC.

Under the terms of the agreement, which is expected to be ratified in the near future, Norway will be in a preferential position to obtain market access for some of its major exports to Indonesia, including marine and fish produce, as well as agricultural products, such as cheese, chocolates, and coffee. Other major sectors to benefit from greater market access include industrial products, such as machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, in addition to luxury manufactured goods, such as watches. CEPA also promises to boost services trade, including for telecommunications, financial services, and energy.

Significantly, the agreement contains chapters on sustainable development, including provisions on environment covering forest resources and managed plantation development, as well as on workers’ rights.

Europe-China trade and investment deals’ state of play

China’s FTA negotiations with Norway align with Beijing’s plans to expand its free trade and investment treaty networks across Europe. To that extent, China has already concluded trade agreements with Switzerland and Iceland. It completed a detailed and comprehensive FTA with Georgia in 2017, which was ratified on January 1, 2018, touted by China as the first bilateral trade agreement concluded with a “Eurasian” economy. From a European perspective, Georgia also has an economic association agreement with the EU, which includes a preferential trade regime for the purposes of facilitating market access between the two – based on an alignment of their domestic regulations.

Aside from China’s FTA negotiations with Norway, the Chinese government is also in talks over an FTA with Moldova, while exploring a joint feasibility study in upgrading its FTA with Switzerland. At the end of December 2020, China and the European Union had signed an in-principle Comprehensive Agreement on Investment treaty (CAI), following seven years of negotiations. The CAI is not a free trade agreement, and focuses on providing greater protection for bilateral investments between the EU and China. At present, it is being scrutinized by EU institutions, including the European Parliament and member states, before being ratified.

From an economic perspective, the CAI does not provide a substantially closer investment partnership between the EU and China; it basically consolidates China’s and individual EU member states’ existing bilateral investment agreements and each party’s respective commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It does, however, seek to address EU member states’ concerns on sustainable economic development and further requires that China comply with International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions.

Although the CAI seemingly gives rise to issues surrounding the EU’s “strategic autonomy”, supposedly enabling greater policy independence from the US, it is also unlikely to precipitate a major policy shift towards China. Rather, the CAI is anticipated to operate in parallel with recent EU regulations on more robust inward investment screening and in establishing a new regime for incorporating sanctions to be imposed in relation to breaches of human rights.

As for the UK, given its actual departure from the EU at the end of last year, it is the only major European economy that has neither concluded nor is in talks with China on an FTA or a new investment treaty. It only retains a relatively outdated bilateral investment treaty,, that dates back to 1986.

That’s because this dispute is bigger than just glyphosate, GM corn or market access to Mexico.
Mexico’s decree is no model of clarity.
Mexico says glyphosate is a carcinogen, and that GM corn puts Mexico’s native corn at risk.
Moreover, from 2009 to 2013 the government authorized 177 projects to research and experiment with GM corn.","mexico, geneticallymodified, science, usmca, gm, challenge, mexicos, corn, ban, trade, glyphosate, decree, wto",tradedispute,Trade Dispute,"On New Year’s Eve, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, issued a decree that has U.S. agriculture worried. The decree bans glyphosate, a herbicide, as well as genetically-modified (GM) corn. Since Mexico is the largest export market for American corn products, U.S. agriculture is weighing whether to ask Washington to file a trade dispute under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The U.S. should file a case, but not at USMCA. Rather, the U.S. should take its case against Mexico to the World Trade Organization (WTO). That’s because this dispute is bigger than just glyphosate, GM corn or market access to Mexico. Washington needs to unblock the appellate body and fight for science-based trade on the WTO’s much bigger stage.

Mexico’s decree is no model of clarity. It includes six articles, but the heavy lifting is done by three of them. Article 2 says that the federal government will “refrain from acquiring, using, distributing, promoting and importing glyphosate or agrochemicals that contain it as an active ingredient.” Article 3 nods to the fact that glyphosate is used by Mexican agriculture, and thus promises to deliver “sustainable and culturally appropriate alternatives.” Finally, Article 6 sets out that the federal government will “revoke and refrain from granting permits for the release into the environment of genetically modified corn seeds.” All of this is supposed to happen by 2024.

Why is Lopez Obrador doing this? The decree explains its objective thusly: “achieving self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.” In other words, it’s trade protectionism. The Consejo Nacional Agropecuario de México, which represents the country’s agribusinesses, claims that Mexican food chains will collapse without U.S. imports. The group estimates, moreover, that banning glyphosate could result in as much as a 45 percent decline in Mexico’s agricultural output. The payoff for Lopez Obrador is that the decree is expected to curry favor with rural farmers, who put their electoral weight behind him in Mexico’s last election.

How is this a trade dispute? Science, or more accurately, the lack of science on which the decree is based. Mexico says glyphosate is a carcinogen, and that GM corn puts Mexico’s native corn at risk. But Mexico can’t scientifically back any of this up, at least not in the way USMCA or the WTO would demand in litigation.

The decree offers the “precautionary principle” as its justification, but references the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in this regard, not USMCA or WTO law. Both permit the use of a provisional measure if the science is “insufficient.” But even these must be based on science that exists, and constantly updated in the course of proactively gathering new science.

But Mexico has science. The country’s Interdepartmental Commission for Biosecurity of Genetically Modified Organisms reports that between 2005 and 2019, it issued 671 permits on GM products, including 202 on corn. Moreover, from 2009 to 2013 the government authorized 177 projects to research and experiment with GM corn. Mexico soured on GM corn in 2020, but this was because the government decided to boost domestic production, not because of health and safety concerns.

Mexico’s Plan B is to concede it does have science, and that this science supports a ban. It’s true that the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer said that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans,” but this reflected the institution’s hazard approach to the issue. A hazard approach just evaluates the possibility of harm. USMCA and the WTO demand a risk-based approach, which involves gauging the probability of harm under real-world conditions.

There are some good reasons to file this case at USMCA. For one thing, USMCA is more instructive about the procedural and substantive issues involved in formulating science-based health and safety standards than the WTO. USMCA also has deeper notification requirements. But a win at USMCA would only get the attention of Mexico and Canada, whereas a win at the WTO would deter similar efforts on glyphosate and other herbicides in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and France, all of which have considered, or implemented, bans. Other countries are watching.

Even if Mexico doesn’t comply, the U.S. would benefit from filing at the WTO for three reasons. First, Mexico will have to explain the workings of its GM regime and explain the differential treatment of corn versus cotton, soybeans and wheat. Second, glyphosate is up for renewal in the European Union in 2022, and Europe is debating criteria for a hazard approach to this and its broader regime for endocrine disruptors. And third, it would add political heft to the litigation that Mexican agribusinesses are expected to file in domestic courts.

There’s just one problem. The U.S. is blocking appointments to the Appellate Body. This means that if Mexico were to appeal a U.S. win – as it surely would – the verdict would languish after the first ruling. In this case and others to come, an important way to make U.S. agriculture “whole” again is for the Biden administration to take up WTO reform.

“Everyone should realise what kind of danger we are engaging in: we might end up with less vaccines for the EU.
“The EU Commission brings out the shotgun.","vaccine, dispute, boris, johnson, cause, european, eu, dombrovskis, pfizer, million, vaccines, commission, trade, jabs, uk, damage, warns, longterm",tradedispute,Trade Dispute,"Boris Johnson warned that a vaccine trade war would result in “considerable” and “long-term” damage as the European Union set out a tougher regime to stem supplies of jabs to nations faring better in the pandemic.

Admitting it is a Covid-19 “hotspot”, the European Commission said on Wednesday it may not approve exports to nations with more advanced vaccine rollouts or where there is a better “epidemiological situation”.

The EU announced the move as it is embroiled in a row with AstraZeneca over supplies, but did not rule out Pfizer jabs being restricted to the UK if sufficient vaccines are not shipped to the bloc.

Commission executive vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis denied the export authorisation mechanism was targeted at any one country but said 10 million jabs had moved from the EU to the UK since it introduced checks and that “zero doses” had returned from British plants.

But the Prime Minister told MPs: “I don’t think that blockades of either vaccines or of ingredients for vaccines are sensible, and I think that the long-term damage done by blockades can be very considerable.

“I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade or an interruption of supply chains that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed.”

Mr Dombrovskis argued the controls are necessary because while the EU is one of the “global hotspots of the pandemic” it is also the “largest exporter of vaccines”.

Member states and the commission will consider two key factors before authorising vaccine exports under the mechanism, which was extended until the end of June.

European Commission executive vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis alongside health commissioner Stella Kyriakides (Stephanie Lecocq/AP)

Second, under “proportionality”, they will consider whether the “conditions prevailing” in the destination country are “better or worse than the EU’s”.

Its epidemiological situation, its vaccination rate and its access to vaccines were listed as particular considerations.

Across the EU, just over 11% of adults have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine but in the UK the figure is more than 54%.

Continental Europe is also experiencing a “third wave” of coronavirus cases as the UK slowly emerges from a winter of lockdown.

Concerns over UK supplies will centre largely on Pfizer, the main vaccine export from the bloc and being produced in Germany and Belgium.

Mr Dombrovskis did not rule out restricting the Pfizer product, saying: “Concrete decisions will be taken on a case-by-case basis.”

Today we strengthen our transparency and authorisation mechanism for exports of COVID-19 vaccines. Read-out of the College meeting by EVP @VDombrovskis and Commissioner @SKyriakidesEU. https://t.co/H18vCs1j4u — European Commission ?? (@EU_Commission) March 24, 2021

A spokeswoman for Pfizer said it was assessing the “full implications” of the commission’s move, adding: “We have been clear and consistent with all stakeholders that the free movement of goods and supply across borders is absolutely critical to Pfizer and the patients we serve, particularly during this devastating global pandemic.

“Pfizer is deeply concerned by any legislation that threatens our ability to manufacture in, or export from, the European Union.”

Mr Dombrovskis maintained the EU’s criticism of British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, saying it had “only delivered a small portion of its agreed contractual commitments” to the bloc.

The commissioner said “continued shortfalls in production are not distributed fairly across different contracting countries”, in an apparent reference to the production of AstraZeneca jabs in the UK.

Denying the bloc was implementing an “export ban”, EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said: “We’re dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries.”

Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament’s international trade committee, hit out at the commission’s move, warning it could have consequences for the bloc’s vaccination efforts.

“Everyone should realise what kind of danger we are engaging in: we might end up with less vaccines for the EU.

“Because now all manufacturers are being held hostage for the problems with AstraZeneca,” he said.

“The EU Commission brings out the shotgun.

“But using the cluster munitions we may end up shooting ourselves in the foot because the supply chains for vaccine production might be affected and interrupted.”

Meanwhile the La Stampa website reported that 29 million AstraZeneca doses had been discovered by Italian inspectors being stored at the Catalent plant near Rome under an investigation by the European Commission.

A UK source said Britain is not expecting the delivery of Catalent supplies from Italy, while the commission declined to comment on the report.

AstraZeneca said 13 million doses are awaiting quality control ahead of being dispatched to the Covax initiative for distribution in low-income countries.

Another 16 million are waiting for quality control clearance before being released to Europe, with close to 10 million jabs expected to be delivered to EU states in late March and the balance in April.

A spokesman for the firm said: “It is incorrect to describe this as a stockpile.

“The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time consuming."

Washington has taken aim at China’s tech industry during the bitter trade dispute, putting sanctions on firms including telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd, saying they are a threat to national security, angering Beijing.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan is home to a thriving and world-leading chip industry, and the government has long worried about China’s efforts to copy that success, through fair means or foul.

Speaking at a parliamentary committee meeting on how to respond to the “red supply chain” - a reference to the colour of China’s ruling Communist Party - Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the trade war had created new risks.

“Affected by the U.S.-China technology war, the development of mainland China’s semiconductor industry has been obstructed, but they are still committed to the industry’s development,” she said.

“In order to achieve self-sufficiency in the supply chain, poaching and infiltration are the quickest way for mainland China to do this,” Wang added.

Taiwan’s chip workers have deep experience and speak the same language, meaning they are a “natural target for poaching China has latched onto”, she added.

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hu Mu-yuan, deputy head of Taiwan’s National Security Bureau, said China’s efforts were a threat to not just Taiwan, but also Japan and South Korea, threatening global trade and fair competition.

“Moreover, the Chinese communists are stealing other countries intellectual property to boost their own power,” he added.

Taiwan has strict laws to try and prevent this from happening, but officials have warned China tries to skirt them by setting up front companies on the island, using Taiwanese headhunters and other methods.

“Preventing Taiwan’s key technology and high-tech personnel from being infiltrated by the ‘red supply chain’ has become an important task to protect our industry’s competitiveness and ensure our economic security,” Hu said."

On Tuesday (9 March), the two agriculture bosses had a phone call to relaunch an “active bilateral cooperation” aimed at ensuring global food security and making agriculture more climate-friendly.

The meeting was held just a few days after Washington and the EU called for a four-month suspension of retaliatory tariffs stemming from WTO disputes over government subsidies to aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.

“Prospects for constructive cooperation are looming and a good signal is the suspension of US food tariffs from the EU introduced in 2019,” Wojciechowski commented after the meeting on his Twitter account.

Both leaders recognised the importance of a free and fair trading system that will not only strengthen domestic economies but also help meet the goals of global food security, a US spokesperson said.

According to a diplomatic source familiar with the situation, Vilsack stated that he looks forward to a positive working relationship with the EU in finding positive solutions to challenges facing agriculture, and address longstanding issues.

The discussion also focused on rural economies and the environment, while Vilsack emphasised the importance of respecting different approaches to achieving climate-related goals in agriculture that promote innovation and utilize new technologies.

In an opinion piece published on EURACTIV in February 2020, Vilsack’s predecessor, Sonny Perdue, urged the EU to remove constraints to the adoption of innovative new approaches and technologies, including overly burdensome and unnecessary regulatory restrictions.

Embracing technology to feed a growing world It is time for America and Europe to work together to solve the next great challenge facing us – to produce enough food, with fewer inputs, to feed a growing world population – which means embracing innovation and technology in a safe, sustainable agriculture, writes Sonny Perdue.

Tariff reprieve

In October 2019, the US announced punitive tariffs on EU agri-food products after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruled in their favour over EU subsidies for the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.

The tariffs were enacted last March, concerning imports of EU products worth a total of €6.8 billion and ranging from Italian cheeses to French wines and Scotch whisky.

In retaliation, the EU has been imposing customs duties on $4 billion of American exports since the beginning of November.

In a letter sent to trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on the day of Joe Biden’s inauguration, the chair of the European Parliament’s agriculture committee, Norbert Lins, asked the European Commission on behalf of the majority of political groups “to intervene directly” in the dispute.

On Friday (5 March), the EU and the US announced a four-month tariff reprieve of the tariffs.

The news was eagerly anticipated by the agrifood sector, which has been disproportionately affected by the dispute.

MEPs wink at Biden, call for ending US tariff spat On the very day of Joe Biden’s inauguration in Washington on 20 January, European lawmakers urged the European Commission to settle for good the trade dispute with the US that has soured transatlantic relations in recent years.

Reacting to the news, Wojciechowski called the suspension “good news for European farmers” regarding world markets, while EU farmers’ association COPA-COGECA stressed that the move is of particular importance for the EU and US farming sectors.

In a statement, the farmers’ lobby stressed that European farmers and agri-cooperatives now encourage both partners to “use these four months to find a permanent solution while avoiding causing agriculture to pay a high-price for a conflict they are not involved in”.

“The EU and US have a common interest to work together on reforming the WTO, with possible new ideas on international trade disciplines, for instance in the area of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and a well-functioning dispute settlement body,” they added.

The European alcoholic beverage sector also rejoices, as the United States is the biggest importer of their products.

The EU’s liquor lobby, the Distilled Spirits Council, called the decision “a promising breakthrough in the longstanding trade dispute on civil aircraft subsidies, which has left much destruction to the spirits sector in its wake.”

The deal would suspend a 25% tariff imposed by Europe on American rum, brandy and vodka, as well as a 25% tariff the United States imposed on liqueurs and cordials from Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain, as well as on Cognacs and other grape brandies from France and Germany.

“This is a broad coalition representing a lot of different aspects of the hospitality sector that are invested in supporting the Biden administration through this,” Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, told The Hill.

John Bodnovich, executive director of American Beverage Licensees, called the situation a unifying issue for the industry.

“We’ve all been working on this for the past couple of years and it's good to be united together on this effort,” he said.

American whiskey’s largest export market is the EU, and exports have dropped 37 percent from $702 million to $440 million since the tariffs were first implemented in June 2018.

The shutdowns and closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic have also negatively impacted the industry, which relies on revenues from restaurants, breweries, distilleries and other on-premise services.

“From a retail perspective, COVID-19 closures and operating restrictions have really just ravaged the on-premise industry,” Bodnovich. “We’re already operating here in a very, very tough time.”

“A permanent removal of these tariffs will be a critical, critical element of getting our economy back to full throttle for the betterment of everybody,” Swonger said.

It comes as changes to China’s environmental laws threaten sales of iron ore, which have continued at record pace despite the trade dispute.
Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government remained “concerned about delays affecting vessels carrying coal, including from Australia”.
“We have raised our concerns with Chinese authorities on multiple occasions and continue to do so,” a Dfat spokesperson told Guardian Australia.
Guardian Australia understands Canberra is yet to receive any official information about coal import quotas that China will apply to Australian coal in 2021.","china, import, australian, ore, uncertainty, chinese, concerns, stuck, australia, coal, trade, vessels, iron, renews, spokesperson, quota, ships",tradedispute,Trade Dispute,"The Morrison government has renewed its concerns with China over delays clearing dozens of ships carrying Australian coal, amid wider uncertainty over import quotas that will apply this year.

About 40 ships carrying coal of Australian origin were still awaiting clearance at Chinese ports as of 8 March – fewer than the more than 60 ships that were waiting in November – amid the protracted standoff.

Most of the coal is believed to be metallurgical, the kind used in steelmaking.

It comes as changes to China’s environmental laws threaten sales of iron ore, which have continued at record pace despite the trade dispute.

Analysis of UN trade figures by Guardian Australia shows the immense rise in exports to China, driven mostly by the iron ore boom but also fuelled by a growing desire for goods such as wine and travel by the country’s increasingly large middle class.

Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government remained “concerned about delays affecting vessels carrying coal, including from Australia”.

“We have raised our concerns with Chinese authorities on multiple occasions and continue to do so,” a Dfat spokesperson told Guardian Australia.

“We continue to monitor the situation closely.”

Labor’s trade spokesperson, Madeleine King, said her primary concern was “for the seafarers who are stuck off the coast with no clear plan for how they are able to unload their cargoes and get about their lives and potentially get home”.

She also called on the Australian government to step up efforts to diversify trade links, while noting China would continue to be an important economic partner because “there is no alternative market of the magnitude of the Chinese market”.

Guardian Australia understands the Australian government most recently raised concerns about barriers to coal exports on 2 March, which followed concerns about the vessels and the impact on crew welfare on 8 February.

Guardian Australia understands Canberra is yet to receive any official information about coal import quotas that China will apply to Australian coal in 2021.

Meanwhile, some of the coal that had been awaiting clearance has since been on-sold to Vietnam and India.

The Dfat spokesperson said the current impasse involved private commercial arrangements and that Australia urged all parties to reach a resolution as soon as possible.

“A quick resolution will allow vessels to unload in a timely manner to satisfy Chinese buyers and consumer needs and ensure the wellbeing of crew aboard these vessels,” the spokesperson said.

While China can buy coal elsewhere, it is heavily dependent on ore from Australia because it is one of the world’s biggest producers and closer and therefore cheaper to ship from than iron from other producing countries in Africa and South America.

Australia has also economically benefited from the collapse in 2019 of a dam at Brumadinho in Brazil, which killed 270 people. The mine’s operator, Vale, has been unable to restore production to previous levels.

This, together with surging demand from China’s construction industry, which is going through a post-Covid building boom, has created a shortage of iron ore in China, driving the price to as much as US$175 a tonne.

However, in a note to clients this week Marius van Straaten, a mining analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley, said new emissions controls on steel mills could cut production by as much as 2.3% this year.

This could result in a “balanced or even over-supplied market on a full-year basis”, putting “significant downward pressure on the 62% Fe benchmark price”, he said.

Relations between China and Australia have been deteriorating for the past few years, with Beijing objecting to Canberra’s increasingly tight foreign investment rules, its ban on Chinese telco Huawei in the 5G network, and new foreign interference laws.

But the relationship sank to new lows last year after Beijing felt it was the target of Canberra’s early public calls for an independent investigation into the origins and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Chinese authorities subsequently rolled out actions targeting a range of Australian export sectors including coal, barley and wine.

Beijing has also taken umbrage at the Australian government’s statements criticising the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang – with China describing such comments as meddling in its “internal affairs”.

In a sign of the ongoing tensions between the two countries, China in a statement to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday said it was “deeply concerned” by Australia’s operation of offshore detention centres and called for them to be closed immediately.

Earlier in the week China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, specifically raised Australia’s record on Indigenous people when brushing off claims that China was engaged in a campaign of genocide in Xinjiang.

“Speaking of genocide, many people would have in their minds the native Americans of the 16th century, African slaves of the 19th century, the Jewish people of the 20th century, and the Aboriginal Australians who are still struggling even today,” Wang said at a press event on Monday."
