The future of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital is on shaky ground, and after our initial coverage of its impact on SCF, let’s look ahead.
This forced Credit Suisse Group AG to freeze a client fund that bought the debt — and has rocked the supply chain finance industry.
Remember, banks typically don’t bank these suppliers already — see: KYC for Supply Chain Finance is an Unmitigated DisasterSo how do fintech vendors ensure the suppliers they are financing have been KYC checked?

WHAT IS SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE?
Supply chain finance does not have the same disclosure requirements applied to more conventional forms of debt.
Often this does not come to light until a company runs into trouble, a risk that prompted credit ratings agency Moody's to liken supply chain financing to ""tiger traps"".
Founded by Lex Greensill, a former Citigroup and Morgan Stanley banker and adviser to the British government, Greensill is the largest non-bank provider of supply chain finance.","fund, funds, does, large, finance, greensill, business, parts, explainer, supply, suppliers, financing, model, greensills, chain"

All this technology is percolating, and we’re seeing a lot of startup activity focused on supply chain – increased automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning – to do a better job of moving products throughout the supply chain.
Finally, protecting, securing and managing critical supply chains, that is the supply chains of goods and materials that are critical to national defense, the economy and health care ranks up there.
What industry learned many decades ago was that too many functions tied to supply chain were separate from one another.

Many companies found themselves somewhere between these two extremes, somewhat satisfied with how their supply chains performed in 2020, but ready to make changes for the new year.
To overcome these issues, supply chain managers more carefully pondered how their people, processes and technology converged to create effective supply chain networks.
They’re also paying attention to the global pandemic and the worldwide vaccine rollout, knowing that these overarching factors may have an impact on their supply chain design strategies in 2021.

Clearly, this executive order proves supply chains are a strategic topic.
Resilient supply chains have a level of agility and responsiveness required to sense, predict, and respond to change during intense turbulence.
As the executive order highlights, “more resilient supply chains are secure and diverse — facilitating greater domestic production, a range of supply, built-in redundancies, adequate stockpiles, safe and secure digital networks”.
