“Frankly, we were also worried about the collapse of all utilities and that the activity of the hospital could be jeopardized,” regional governor Vincenzo De Luca said.

“Thank God, this did not happen. We had a power break, but electricity was restored and now we don’t have any problem in providing care.”

The 21,527-square-foot hole was about 66 feet deep.

Pasco County says a sinkhole repair company went to fill it again last week using things like boulders, chemical foam, rock, and dirt. But it opened back up four days later.

The county put up a fence to keep people away. Several people went over to the fence Thursday to get a glimpse.

The High Springs fire and police departments, along with Alachua County Fire Rescue, responded to a call in the area of 24304 NW 182nd Ave. just after 5:30 Thursday morning to find one woman, of High Springs, had become trapped 40 feet below ground in the sinkhole after her car fell inside.
She was traveling with a man, also of High Springs, but he was able to climb out of the hole to call for help.
The sinkhole is on private property, said Kevin Mangan, public information officer with High Springs Police.
The High Springs man and woman involved told police they were traveling in the car through the woods at about 8 p.m. Wednesday when it fell into the sinkhole.","spends, springs, sinkhole, woman, hours, hole, fell, traveling, 11, area, property, car, high",sinkhole,geophysical event,"Four months after two people riding all-terrain vehicles were rescued from a High Springs sinkhole, another woman had to be rescued after a small car fell into the same hole.

She was traveling with a man, also of High Springs, but he was able to climb out of the hole to call for help.

The sinkhole is on private property, said Kevin Mangan, public information officer with High Springs Police. He said following an event in September when two ATV riders fell into the hole, the property owner had taken steps to barricade the hole using large boulders and ropes, but that trespassers managed to remove the boulders, in some cases pushing them into the sinkhole.

Security cameras and bright yellow “No trespassing” and “Private property” signs are also in the area, Mangan said.

“You really can’t miss it,” he said.

The sinkhole is in a wooded area about a quarter-mile from Poe Springs Road. Traveling in a car is nearly impossible in the area, Mangan said, which required first responders to use four-wheel drive vehicles and ATVs to get to the scene.

The High Springs man and woman involved told police they were traveling in the car through the woods at about 8 p.m. Wednesday when it fell into the sinkhole. Both were able to crawl out of the vehicle on their own, police said, and the man was able to get out of the hole to call for help.

The woman, unable to climb to the top of the steep slope, remained trapped underground overnight.

Using a harness and rope system, fire Lt. Kevin Pearson rescued the woman shortly before 7:30 a.m. Thursday. She sustained no serious injuries after nearly 11 hours below ground.

Mangan said the police department continues to work closely with the property owner to investigate the situation."

A ‘massive’ sinkhole that appeared on a residential street in Gorton overnight was caused by a collapsed sewer.

The large crater appeared on Walmer Street in Abbey Hey on Wednesday evening (January 20) amid bad weather due to Storm Christoph.

Photos on social media showed a car being ‘swallowed’ up by the sinkhole, which is estimated to be around four square metres large.

Following the incident, parts of the street were cordoned off by barriers with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service at the scene.

Fire services said that four properties had to be evacuated as a 'precaution'.

Surveyors were also at the site in order to assess for structural damage to surrounding properties.

A Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson added: “Firefighters were called to reports of a collapsed sewer on Walmer Street, in Gorton, at 9pm on Wednesday, 20 January.

“One fire engine from Gorton quickly attended the scene. Firefighters assisted colleagues from United Utilities and helped make the scene safe. Four properties were evacuated as a precaution.

“Firefighters were in attendance for around five hours.”

The impact of Storm Christoph also saw the plaza outside of the Lowry Hotel submerged in water after the River Irwell burst its banks.

On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency also issued a severe flood warning to residents in Didsbury, Northenden and Chorlton following heavy flooding.

But on Thursday morning, hours after fire crews had evacuated the four nearest homes — and as engineers assessed the damage — two properties came tumbling down too.

“I'm hoping some things might be salvageable but it looks like the roof will collapse,"" said a 26-year-old woman who lives in one of the houses. “The upstairs looks like it's going to come down as well — it's got everything I own.""

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the single mother-of-four added: “I don't understand how my house has come down. I'm just trying to get it to sink in … my kids could have been in there.""

Mobile phone footage caught the moment of collapse. In the video, an ominous rumble can be heard before a man off screen shouts: “Get back! Get back!”

Split seconds later, the walls come down.

United Utilities initially said the hole had been caused by a collapsing sewer. But it later altered its statement saying: ""It is not known what caused the sinkhole but this will be investigated.""

Possible lines of inquiry will include the factor heavy rain brought by Storm Christoph may have caused.

Visiting the scene, Afzal Khan, Labour MP for Gorton, called the events “incredibly distressing”.

He added: “My thoughts are with those whose properties have sustained damage or have been evacuated as a result of the sinkhole. I am grateful for the quick response of the emergency services to the situation, and I am hugely relieved that no one has been hurt.”"

Director of the company RiverOak Strategic Partners that owns Manston Aiport Tony Freudmann believed the hole, thought to be caused by water erosion, is manmade.

Mr Freudmann told KentOnline after visiting the site: 'I'm not an expert, but speaking as a layperson, it looks to me that the hole is man-made.

'I think it has been dug out for some reason in the past and then been capped.'

He also explained how the hole is not on the main runway but on 'an old taxi runway' which runs alongside it.

A Department of Transport spokesman told MailOnline: 'Once we became aware of the issue at Manston we acted quickly to ensure the specific area was safely cordoned off, allowing the rest of the airfield to remain in use.'

Manston started life during the First World War as a military station in 1915 with a base at Westgate Bay for seaplanes, before growing to include four underground hangars, a railway line, a power station and barracks for 3,000 men by the end of the war.

It was again an important forward based during the Second World War and Barnes Wallis used the base to test his bouncing bomb in 1943 before the famous Dambusters raid.

Post-war it became an American base for eight years and then returned to the RAF in 1960 where it became a major diversionary airfield for aircraft in trouble. In the following decades there were also holiday charter flights organised, especially over the summer.

But the closure of RAF Manston was announced in 1999, with the civil part of the airport continuing - but this also then shut in 2014 with the airport losing £10,000 a day, one year after it was bought by Stagecoach co-founder Ann Gloag for £1.

It boasts the 11th-longest civilian runway in the UK at more than 9,000ft, meaning it is nearly two miles long."

Halfway between Melbourne and Adelaide, South Australia's Limestone Coast holds a cornucopia of delights, hidden below the Earth's surface. Lava that erupted from volcanoes thousands of years ago formed a Swiss cheese network of 800 caves. Over time, some of the roofs of these caves have collapsed, exposing the secret existence of 50 sinkholes in the region. Here's some you should visit.

Hells Hole

See Also Limestone Coast travel guide

About 20 kilometres from anywhere resembling a town in the south-east, a inconspicuous dirt road cuts through man-made forest to the most ominously-named sinkhole of them all. Despite the popularity of other surrounding cenotes, there's not a single person to be seen on the road, or at the park from which a pathway leads to a shaggy and distinctly out-of-place patch of bush. It's eerily quiet when I reach the hellmouth, which has been made accessible to visitors by an enclosed steel bridge which juts over the top of the sinkhole, the height from which makes me instantly woozy. I clutch my new iPhone a little tighter, brave a few quick shots, and then scuttle back to the safety of my car, just in time to see an entourage of visitors arrive. Hells Hole is 45 metres in diameter, 25 metres deep and it's 38 metres to the water from the viewing platform. It's a popular site for diving, and permits can be obtained through ForestrySA. The similarly accessible Caroline Sinkhole is a short drive away in Penambol Conservation Park. Sea Coast Hill Road, Caveton

Umpherston Sinkhole

Photo: Mike Haines/SATC

Scottish settler, farmer and politician James Umpherston purchased the property called ""The Caves"" in 1868, planting the seeds to create what is now known as the magical sunken garden. It's clear that Unpherston can no longer be considered much of a ""hidden"" gem, given the expansive adjoining car park and cafe and the huge numbers of people swarming through its gardens in the middle of the day during the Christmas holidays. It's not the only thing swarming, however; bees are a feature of the gardens, but don't blame them for the constant buzzing noise that echoes around this old cenote. That's the sound of a dozen drones, whose owners are all vying to outdo each other on social media platforms. However the best snaps are actually taken from the bottom of the sinkhole, capturing its huge circumference and beautiful curtain-like hanging vines. Twenty metres deep and 50 metres across, the paradisaical hole is in stark contrast to the hellmouth above; outside of school holidays it would be a very pleasant place to picnic. Jubilee Hwy E, Mount Gambier

Cave Garden

A poorer cousin of Umpherston, but conveniently located in central Mount Gambier is the Cave Garden, a 27 metre hole in the ground filled with water that used to be the town's water supply. Again it was ably decorated during the 1890s with shady trees and chairs, but the end result is more of a rough-and tumble overgrown garden, with a pathway and viewing platforms leading halfway down to the bottom. File under ""since we're here, we may as well"". It may be more interesting during the winter months when water flows into the cenote. 1 Bay Road, Mount Gambier

The Little Blue Lake

With age estimates ranging between 15,000 to 100,000 years, the Little Blue Lake could outdate the larger Blue Lake by up to 95,000 years. Around 10 minutes' drive south of Mount Gambier, the Little Blue Lake feels more like a huge deep swimming pool in the middle of a gumtree-studded paddock than any kind of former cave. Recently embellished with stairs that lead down to the water and a floating pontoon, this is a fun spot to camp out for a day of swimming (although be warned, there are no facilities). The stairs and the pontoon do not deter the kids from jumping off the side of the sinkhole's sheer 8-metre tall walls into the waters below - neither do the signs forbidding it. The lake is located between Mount Schank and Mount Gambier, two dormant volcanoes. As the name suggests, it does turn blue on a regular basis, but don't be disappointed to find it green - its standard colour. The maximum depth is around 47 metres. Nearby Kilsby Sinkhole (on private property) can be dived or viewed if you book ahead. Protip: they produce gin from the sinkhole's waters. Mount Salt Road, Mount Schank

The granddaddy of them all, the Blue Lake and the adjoining emerald-coloured Valley Lake are worth a visit, even if it's just a drive by. But if you're spending some time in Mt Gambier, or using it as a base, the Blue Lake has a 3.6 kilometre walking track around its circumference (which you can also drive). The lake is an extinct volcano whose waters changes shades of blue depending on the season. For those of us missing regular trips to the US, the lake is the closest thing you'll get to Oregon's Crater Lake - and a damn site smaller (the Oregon version is 8 kilometres in diameter and a 53 kilometre drive around the rim!). Protip: Adjacent Valley Lake - another crater lake - is the hidden gem here, a lush and quiet spot with picnic grounds, a wildlife sanctuary and walking trails.

Naracoorte Caves

You can't mention the sinkholes of Mount Gambier without talking about the World Heritage Listed, 800,000 year old Limestone Coast caves. Of the 28 caves that are in the national park, only four are open to the public, with the rest reserved for scientific research. Guided tours give a 30 minute snapshot of history and science and spotlight some of the caves' most magnificent stalactites and stalagmites. We see a couple of bones from a flat-faced leaf-eating kangaroo - a two metre high, 200kg creature misfortunate enough to fall into the cave 15,000 years ago, unwittingly donating its life to science. Still, that makes it positively youthful compared to some of the fossils dating back to half a million years that are also found here. For information on visiting, see www.naracoortecaves.sa.gov.au

According to documents obtained by ABC Action News reporter Ryan Smith, that fencing and traffic control devices are costing $300 per day in public funds, totaling more than $32,000 since October.

Back in October 2020 the sinkhole was expanded.

“Are you kidding me,” said neighbor Julie Killingworth. “No, the county should not have to pay $300 a day during a plague. No, the property owners need to reimburse immediately.”

In a strongly-worded letter to three listed property owners, a county attorney states the sinkhole poses “a severe threat to the life, health, and/or safety of persons traversing areas on or near the depression.”

Property owners responsible for making repairs to the sinkhole are Trinity Varsity Club, a sports bar and restaurant, the Spring Haven Condominium Association, and Gator Crossings at Trinity.

The sinkhole was in the process of being filled when it expanded again just a few days later.

ABC Action News reached out to all three businesses and no one has responded to our request to find out what’s being done to make a fix.

Attorney Kristi Sims’ December letter also states, “it is clear to me that your ongoing failure to correct the dangerous and unsafe conditions on your parcel violate a number of provisions of the Pasco County Code of Ordinances.”

Pasco County officials confirm the three property owners will have to reimburse the county for the $300 daily cost to maintain the area around the sinkhole."

Philip Bogenberger, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service, said work will start soon.

“Repairs are scheduled to begin this month and will take place after retail hours,” he said in a statement. “Delivery will continue as usual, and we do not expect any impact to our retail hours or operations.”

Officials with the city said Morganton bears no responsibility for the problem, adding that it is a “private drainage issue” and that a Greensboro engineer was handling the project for the post office.

The sinkhole is near the North Green Street/N.C. Highway 181 entrance to the post office, but N.C. Department of Transportation spokesman David Uchiyama said it is outside the department’s right-of-way and on private property.

Aerial photos provided to The News Herald by Cooke Photography and Aerial Video show the sinkhole has compromised the self-service/automatic carwash next door to the post office. The photos show the sinkhole is about the width of two of the carwash bays and has collapsed the ground beneath and the wall between those two bays nearest the post office.

Tim Biddix owns the carwash and the property on which it sits, and said the sinkhole is the result of an issue with the post office’s drainage system. The post office owns its property, as well, and the sinkhole lies on both lots.

Biddix said the situation likely will result in demolition of his building, followed by a decision either to rebuild or sell the lot.

“We checked into trying to our building stabilized before it got to where it is now,” he said. “Everybody we checked with said we’d just be wasting our money until the post office got theirs fixed. ... We were told they were supposed to start it two weeks ago. We had talked with their engineering firm, and they were supposed to contact me and start two weeks ago.

“Nobody has ever contacted me and, of course, they haven’t started. We’re not real sure. We’re just kind of on hold. ... There’s probably some miscommunication there or something. But we can’t do anything until they fix their problem, because they’re dumping water down on us.”

In addition to the two destroyed bays, Biddix said the equipment room next to them likely will be gone the next time the area receives a good rain.

The area around the carwash, North Green post office entrance and part of the parking lot remains barricaded off. Additionally, a smaller hole can be seen in the grass between Sanford Drive and the carwash.

Rescuers found themselves the rescuees after a brand new fire truck slid into a sinkhole Sunday morning.

The crew had just pulled up at a reported structure fire when they felt the ground sink beneath them.

“They parked in front of the house, then the street began to sink underneath the front of the engine,” said Lt. Brian Ebmeyer with the Colorado Springs Fire Department. “... All four of the guys were in the engine when it began to sink. As soon as they recognized it was going to sink, all of ‘em got out quickly, not knowing what they end result was going to be, if it was going to stop right there.”

A sinkhole had begun to form in the road in the exact spot the fire engine had parked.

“It’s completely coincidental that they happened to stop in front of the house,” Ebmeyer said. “The reason we got called out there was in the house, someone had heard a loud bang in the basement, which I think ... connected with the sinkhole being created unknown to engine 10 when they pulled up, but they ended up right over that sinkhole where it ended up dropping through the street.”

It took two wreckers to get the 42,000-pound truck out of the hole.

“One to lift it up and one to pull it backward to get it out.”

The original call for the fire was at 4 a.m., and it was well after sunrise when the truck was back on solid ground.

Firefighters found no evidence of fire and believe the noise the resident heard was a water main break.

“It was a water main break right below that section of the street that caused the soft spot in the street that allowed the engine to fall down into it,” Ebmeyer said. “... There was no structure fire, it was just the investigation of a loud noise in the basement. Unknown noise in the basement that turned out to be what we think was related to the water main break.”

The truck, which has only been in service since Jan. 21, was mostly no worse for the wear and able to return to the streets that same day.

“There was a little bit of damage to the front bumper of engine 10, but other than that after we thoroughly checked it out, there was no other damage to engine 10.”

All in all, it gave firefighters quite the story for their Sunday.

“That’s not not normally what we are up against. We never know what what things we’re going to come up against every day, but that’s not the run of the mill call for us to pull our pumper out of a out of a sinkhole.”

Akron Beacon Journal

A sinkhole on the berm of Wise Road in Green has forced the closure of a section of the road, the city announced Thursday.

City road crews examined the cavity Thursday morning after someone called the city about the problem.

The sinkhole is located near the intersection of Wise and Mayfair roads, east of Raintree Golf and Event Center and the Dick Goddard Dog Park at Ariss Park. The dog park, which was renamed Wednesday, can still be accessed via Massillon Road.

Communications Manager Valerie Wolford said Ohio Department of Natural Resources staff examined the hole Thursday and believe the depression may linked to abandoned mines in the area.

“We had one of these a few years ago,” she said.

ODNR maps show the Haurer coal mine owned by R and T Coal Co. was worked in the area before it was abandoned in 1937.

A document generated during the Nexus Pipeline project determined the mine was “underlying” Ariss Park, but posed no threat to the pipeline. Little information is available for many mines operated in Ohio during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Wolford said that ODNR will be responsible for filling the sinkhole and other actions to repair the damage.

“Their engineers are putting a stabilization plan together,” she said.

After ODNR completes its task, Green will repair Wise Road where needed. The process is expected to take about a month.

The detour runs from Mayfair Road to Greensburg Road to Massillon Road. Individuals registered on the Green city website can view the map online at https://bit.ly/2O5Yjnh.

Mall management has cordoned off about a 50-foot radius around the affected area near Dick's Sporting Goods.

The sinkhole is an estimated 6 to 8 feet wide and 12 to 14 feet deep. It's believed it was caused by a drainage culvert under the parking lot, weakened by severe weather and temperature fluctuations in recent days.

The mall plans to begin repairs this week.

""It's inconvenient, but fortunately, there was no major damage and nobody was injured,"" said Joe Bell, director of communications for Cafaro Company.

Bell said the sinkhole does not present a major safety hazard, but is just the type of thing which can happen after big storms.

""Whenever you have severe weather, any weak spots in culverts may fail,"" Bell explained. ""It tends to create a pocket in there. The water rushes in and churns out an underground pocket of soil. When the soil is undermined, the pavement gives way.""

He said the contractor will replace and repair the culvert, backfill the hole and repave the area.

""It's not a difficult fix,"" Bell said, ""but we do need to address it right away so it doesn't get worse.""

Footage shows a substantial hole which has exposed the underground area.

Grant Gardens was opened in 1914, sitting above a former cemetery which is believed to hold up to 80,000 bodies.

Memorials and structures from the graveyard have since been removed, however the graves themselves remain intact underground.

A spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said: “Grant Gardens was originally a cemetery in the 19th century and was turned into a public park in the inter-war years.

“The sinkhole is the result of a former crypt that was not filled in correctly at the time.”

The sinkhole was reported as a cause for concern by a dog walker on Friday evening and the area was quickly cordoned off.

(Feb. 10, 2021) — A project led by researchers from the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) at the University of Kentucky will soon help officials and residents in west-central Kentucky better understand the risks related to karst and mitigate potential damage from sinkholes.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs, has awarded $293,984 to KGS to develop a multijurisdictional plan for karst mitigation in the Lincoln Trail Area Development District (LTADD).

According to the KGS, karst is a landscape that includes sinkholes, sinking streams, caves and springs. It is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone. Kentucky is one of the most famous karst areas of the world, with much of its prime farmland underlain by karst.

“Sinkholes are common in much of Kentucky and they cause millions of dollars in damage to homes, buildings, highways and other infrastructure,” said Junfeng Zhu, KGS hydrogeologist who is leading the project. “The main goal of this project is to reduce sinkhole related damages in Kentucky. The tasks we planned are aiming to help emergency management officials better pinpoint areas most affected by sinkhole hazards.”

According to Zhu, the LTADD is one of several districts in Kentucky prone to sinkhole development and is an area increasing in population and urban and suburban development.

“In this project, we focus our efforts on LTADD, hoping that we can expand the methods we develop and lessons we learn from this project to other Kentucky areas with sinkhole problems,” Zhu said.

The research team will use light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to characterize existing sinkholes and assess the area for risk of future sinkhole hazards. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser light to generate precise, 3-D information about the shape of the landscape. The project will also utilize to the statewide “KyFromAbove” initiative, which is focused on building and maintaining a basemap of the state as a public resource.

Informational tools will be developed to aid data collection, including a web-based reporting system for sinkhole collapses. The team will also develop brochures and smart phone apps for community members that describe how sinkholes form and ways to minimize their impact. Mitigation strategies for each jurisdiction will be incorporated into a plan to help jurisdictions adopt these practices.

The LTADD includes eight west-central Kentucky counties, including Breckinridge, Grayson, Hardin, LaRue, Marion, Meade, Nelson and Washington.

“The LTADD is underlain by limestone with some of the highest sinkhole potential in Kentucky,” said Bill Haneberg, state geologist and director of KGS. “Understanding where, when and why individual sinkholes occur will help landowners alleviate a problem that costs Kentuckians millions of dollars each year.”

To learn more about the project, contact sarah.mardon@uky.edu or call 859-257-5500.

The mission of the Kentucky Geological Survey, a research center within the University of Kentucky, is to support sustainable prosperity of the Commonwealth, the vitality of its flagship university and the welfare of its people. KGS does this by conducting research and providing unbiased information about geologic resources, environmental issues and natural hazards affecting Kentucky.

The “Multijurisdictional Mitigation Plan for Karst for the Lincoln Trail Area Development District” project was supported by the Kentucky Department of Military Affairs through FEMA by award number PON2 095 2100000540."

According to Atlas Obscura, decades of drilling for oil and gas in Winkler County, especially during the peak years between 1926 and 1964, have resulted in an extremely unstable landscape.

Fast forward to 1980, a small, bubbly hole grew to over 120 yards wide and 110 feet deep in 24 hours. Today, Wink Sink No. 1, near the Hendricks oil well 10-A, measures over 117 meters across. To make matters worse, Wink Sink No. 2, near Gulf WS-8 supply well, opened 22 years later in 2002 and now measures 361 feet across - the length of a football field.

Researchers with Southern Methodist University say that the areas surrounding the sinkholes are becoming more and more unstable, and effectively closing the 1-mile gap between the two. When taking into account satellite imagery and research, scientists say that given the right amount of instability, the holes will connect. It's just uncertain when that will be.

Jin-Woo Kim research scientist, in the Roy M. Huffington Department of Earth Sciences at SMU, described the findings in the scientific journal Remote Sensing, in the article “Ongoing deformation of sinkholes in Wink, Texas, observed by time-series Sentinel-1A SAR Interferometry.”

“This area is heavily populated with oil and gas production equipment and installations, hazardous liquid pipelines, as well as two communities. The intrusion of freshwater to underground can dissolve the interbedded salt layers and accelerate the sinkhole collapse,” said Kim. “A collapse could be catastrophic. Following our study, we are collecting more high-resolution satellite data over the sinkholes and neighboring regions to monitor further development and collapse.”

“I would be very concerned,” his partner Zhong Lu, a professor, said in a research interview.

If you take a drive out west, officials have fenced off the two sinkholes, as they're located close to the towns of Wink (population 940) and Kermit (population: 6,000). This hasn't stopped curious Texans from making the trip. Fair warning - if caught in the vicinity of the sinkholes, you could be arrested for trespassing.

Take a look at this incredible drone footage of Wink Sink #1. It's a breathtaking sight, but the sense of danger lurking below, really is a Texas-sized reason for concern."

KONYA

The number of sinkholes has risen substantially in a year due to the excessive use of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the Konya Plain in the central Turkish province, which is known as the “grain silo” of Turkey due to its vast wheat fields.

While authorities have been working on plans on how to fill the voids, the number of sinkholes, which was around 330 last year, has almost doubled to 600 this year in the region, which is highly affected by drought caused by global warming.

No casualties were reported so far, but sinkholes render a significant portion of fields unusable.

The Sinkhole Application and Research Center in the province of Konya has initiated a comprehensive study on sinkholes that pose a danger to agricultural life and scare residents in the region.

“Until the beginning of 2020, we had determined the number of sinkholes to be around 350-360 in the region. We think that this number is at the level of 600 or even more now,” said Fetullah Arık, head of the center, adding that a significant part of the basin carries risk.

Arık underlined the need for a mechanism involving all stakeholders to curb uncontrolled groundwater use.

Sinkholes are almost exclusive to the Konya Plain, which stretches as far as the neighboring province of Karaman.

While some sinkholes are shallow, others can be as deep as 150 meters.

Sinkholes are a fairly recent phenomenon, but the uncontrolled use of water since the 1970s is the main factor behind their rise."

Wellington City Council is urging commuters to keep an eye on media and social media early on Friday to avoid delays, following overnight repairs.

The sinkhole emerged on Wednesday, at the Hunter St intersection, and had caused a cavity around 3 metres deep to open up under the road, and a 1.5-metre wide hole in the road.

A council spokesman said the sinkhole was caused by a break in a stormwater pipe deep beneath the road which, through the ebb and flow of the tide, washed away the road base above the pipe.

Work was carried out at the site on Wednesday night and was planned to continue again overnight on Thursday, with workers beginning shoring work to stabilise the ground and the road around the full extent of the broken pipe.

“On engineers’ advice, further work is needed tonight to conduct a CCTV inspection of the damaged pipe and to further shore up the sinkhole to reduce the risk to road users from any further collapse,” the council said in a statement on Thursday evening.

“We expect this work to continue over the next couple of nights, after which the road will be able to be fully re-opened. This will mean continued traffic disruption until that work is complete, and we thank motorists for their patience while this work is undertaken.”

It is hoped that two southbound lanes of Jervois Quay will be available for Friday’s morning rush-hour traffic, but that will be confirmed, or otherwise, before 6am on Friday.

The council said a full repair of the pipe would still need to be carried out.

“The pipe was due for renewal within the next 10 years and this will now be accelerated to take place within the next six months. We will keep the public informed of when this full repair is likely to take place.”

The 450mm diameter pipe, made of earthenware and laid in the 1900s, fills and empties with the tide.

Over time, a hole in the pipe was thought to have enabled water to gradually erode and wash away the sub-soil, causing a collapse of the surrounding ground.

Ross Giblin/Stuff Workers assess the sinkhole on Jervois Quay on Wednesday afternoon.

The hole is located directly above a stormwater culvert and some gas mains but no drinking water or wastewater pipes are believed to be in the area.

The man was riding across a field on Bowesfield Farm in Stank, south Cumbria, at midday yesterday when the ground suddenly collapsed beneath him. Pictured: The sinkhole

The area in south Cumbria contains a number of early 19th-century disused iron ore mines, making sinkholes an ever-present danger.

Ian Westall of Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The ground just fell away with the weight of the bike on that particular spot and he was swallowed up into the sinkhole.

'We peered down and could see the farmer sat up, and we could just make out the outline of his bike under a mound of earth.

'I'm sure he was in deep shock.'

The opening was about 8ft wide at the top but widened below 'like a wine carafe', which posed additional risk to rescuers.

Mr Westall added: 'You've got a lip at the top which went down into a narrow throat.

'Then there was a large bulbous bottom which opened up 33ft in one direction and 13ft in the other.

'Obviously, with unstable ground and people on the surface unsighted, there was an inherent risk.

'We had to make sure the rescuers weren't going to be involved in any further movement or collapse of the ground.

'So we widened the cordon area and had only those directly involved in the rescue at the scene.'

The iron industry in the Lake District began in the 12th century and was at its peak in the 19th and 20th centuries with mining and iron smelting complexes.

The unidentified farmer suffered chest injuries in the fall, and was today recovering

The industry declined during the mid 20th century because of dwindling ore reserves and cheap foreign imports.

Cumbria Fire And Rescue said the rescue was an 'excellent multi-agency team effort'.

They said: 'Earlier today, crews from Barrow and Ulverston attended an incident where an individual had fallen 60ft into a sinkhole in a field whilst riding a quad bike.

'Alongside our colleagues from Mountain Rescue, we were able to bring the individual to safety using line rescue equipment.

A central Croatian region about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of the capital, Zagreb, is pocked with round holes of all sizes, which appeared after December's 6.4-magnitude quake that killed seven people and caused widespread destruction.

Scientists have been flocking to Mecencani and other villages in the sparsely-inhabited region for observation and study.

“These are so-called dropout sinkholes, and they appeared because of the specific geological composition of this area, as the soil rests on limestone rocks heavily saturated with groundwater,” said geologist Josip Terzic of the Croatian Geological Survey.

While the appearance of sinkholes is not unusual following strong seismic activity, residents have been baffled by their number — about 100 have been spotted over the past two months — and the speed at which they emerged after the main earthquake on Dec. 29, which was followed by a series of aftershocks. Geologists have said that the temblor accelerated the process of sinkhole formation that would normally have taken years, if not decades.

Terzic said scientists are planning various exploration methods to determine the underwater morphology and other characteristics. He spoke to The Associated Press as he stood beside a large sinkhole that he said was up to 15 meters (yards) deep and equally wide.

Some sinkholes have appeared by people's houses or on their farmland, prompting the authorities to advise caution. Nenad Tomasevic, a teacher from Mecencani, said it all seemed too much.

“The earthquake itself felt pretty unpleasant to say the least. And after that, these holes started popping up,” said Tomasevic, who had to move to a neighbor’s house after an expanding hole appeared in his backyard.

“Experts say that these sinkholes would have formed naturally anyway over time, but the earthquake acted as sort of a catalyst which sped up the whole process, unfortunately,” he added.

Some three months after the earthquake, the hardest-hit area is still struggling with its devastation, with many houses still in rubble and the region's main town, Petrinja, semi-abandoned. Occasional earthquakes, including those of magnitude 4 or more, can still be felt, further upsetting residents and adding to the coronavirus pandemic woes."

A few hours later, two terraced buildings. At 9pm on January 20, a crater measuring 4 sq metres appeared in Walmer Street, Manchester. Another sinkhole shocked local Scottish walkers, swallowing a section of coastal path between Dysart and West Wemyss on February 4. And, in early March, a sinkhole in Cumbria opened up beneath a farmer riding a quad bike. He was rescued by firefighters and taken to hospital.

These are only recent examples from the UK. The ground opening up and engulfing whatever lies in its path is a pretty common occurrence. Globally, for every 0.1℃ rise in temperature, the number of sinkholes increases by 1%-3%.

A particularly big sinkhole opened in Naples at 6.30am on January 8. The 20-metre deep, 50-metre wide hole suddenly appeared in the car park of the Ospedale del Mare Hospital. It swallowed an oblong section of the car park, caused a power cut and forced the temporary closure of a facility for coronavirus patients.

Sinkholes are particularly common in Naples. More than 190 have opened up in the city between 1915 and 2010, and there are about two to four major incidents per year. A recent study on the historic centre of Naples has identified nine historical churches in imminent risk and a further 57 in potential risk of catastrophic ground collapse.

Sinkholes are not a new or even a bizarre phenomenon. They occur naturally when minerals below the land surface gradually dissolve in rainwater to form cavities. The sudden appearance of a sinkhole occurs when water loosens the soils around and above cavities just enough for the ground above to fall in.

But these scary phenomena are made a lot more common by humanity’s historical interference with the ground. The growth in intrusive construction, deep mining, poorly managed burial of construction and demolition wastes and, crucially, changes in climate that have brought about heavier rainfalls have all caused the recent abnormal rise in number of sinkholes.

Most people don’t think much about the ground. Perhaps this isn’t surprising – there doesn’t seem much to consider. Our relationship with it is usually one-way and with a single objective: we aim to “improve” it or exploit it to provide whatever functional service we seek – turning it into a strong foundation for buildings, or using it as a source of minerals or water.

But the ground is actually a complex and fine-tuned system, a combination of many components – rock, minerals, bacteria, plants – that work and live independently, but continuously interact with one another to create the solid surface and soil we live on and take for granted. Disrupting these natural components and their harmony allows natural hazards such as sinkholes to occur.

The Naples sinkhole

Let’s use the Naples sinkhole to explore how this actually happens in practice.

The Ospedale del Mare Hospital sits on rock called “phonolitic tephrite”. The term tephrite comes from the Greek tephra, meaning ash. This is a porous and brittle rock with a distinct yellowish-grey colour.

Roman builders first used this rock as building stone. Centuries of quarrying led to formation of a complex network of cavities beneath Naples, the like of which can be seen in the stone façade of Sarno Baths in Pompeii. The cavities underlie sandy ash and a top layer of urban soil mixed with wastes and construction rubble.

The top soil is rich in calcium and naturally interacts with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce very soluble carbonates. This top soil was battered in three days of storms in December 2020. It took five days for the flood water to seep into the ground through historical access shafts, washing away the soluble carbonates, loosening the cavity and triggering the sinkhole.

Conventionally, natural ground is engineered into foundation soil for buildings and roads by compacting and grouting (injecting chemicals like cement into the ground). Natural pores in soil are either destroyed or filled with chemicals. For soil, less pores means better strength, but also means penetration of larger volumes of rainwater into the ground through fewer and narrower openings. This high intensity seepage can wash away soluble minerals, loosen the soil around buried cavities, and trigger sinkholes.

So how do we stop this from happening?

New groundwork

Over the past two decades, researchers have been trying to establish new methods of engineering the ground that satisfies the demands of cities but does not disrupt the ground’s natural systems. For example, researchers at Strathclyde University have used fungi to form incredibly durable complex root-like networks of natural fibres in soil to hold it together. These are fibres that can even recover themselves in the face of damage. And, in Newcastle, researchers are genetically engineering bacteria to make soil an “adaptive living material”, so that it strengthens itself in respond to load.

But the “products” of these techniques can clog the natural voids in soil. We are also yet to establish the effectiveness of these techniques in deeper grounds, particularly in urban soils, which are mixed with construction wastes.

My research team studies ways to strengthen natural voids in urban soil, from surface to depths, in three engineered layers: a crust, topsoil and subsoil.

We engineer natural bacteria in the crust to discharge a very sticky glue-like gel and bind soil grains together. Beneath, the topsoil is designed to be light, alive and breathable, rich in organic fibres that weave soil grains together. We engineer these organic fibres to allow them to stretch far more before they rupture during ground movements. The subsoil in urban areas is usually rich in construction wastes. We develop ways for these wastes to feed on the carbon dioxide in soil and transform into very strong fibres.

Many engineers have come to see the way people treat the ground as unproductive, damaging and as backward as our treatment of endangered species, delicate ecosystems and the climate itself. We need to recruit the age-old natural engineering skills of the ground itself to build a more sustainable world."

A sinkhole has opened up in the middle of the intersection of Main Street and Fairford Street, forcing motorists to squeeze past the hole in the ground.

City crews blocked off the sinkhole early on March 8 and erected four barricades and several pylons to prevent motorists from driving into it. The hole is roughly six feet by five feet by four feet in size, based on an eyeball estimate while standing in front of it. The city says it was caused by a previous watermain break.

Traffic restrictions will be in place Tuesday as the city works on the sinkhole. Expect detours and obey all signage. Pedestrian sidewalk access will not be affected. The city expects the road to re-open to traffic by Wednesday. Motorists are reminded that no left turns are allowed at that intersection between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.

Transit will also be affected. As of Mar. 9, all transit stops on Main Street N. between Fairford and Athabasca St. will be temporarily out of service. Additional temporary bus stops will be added at the Northwest and the Northeast corners of First Ave. N.W. and Ominica Street W.

Additionally, please note the transfer point will be temporarily relocated to First Ave. N.W. between River Street W. and High Street in front of Mosaic Place. Buses outbound to Route 1, Route 2, and Route 3 will board on the east side of the street, while the bus outbound to Route 4 will board on the west side.

According to National Geographic, sinkholes are cavities in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer. Two types of sinkholes exist. One forms when the roof of a cave collapses and exposes the underground cavern. The second type forms when water dissolves the rock underneath soil and creates an underground chasm. Without rock to support it, the soil layer collapses and creates a hole on the surface.

Sinkholes are also known as a cenote, sink, sink-hole, swallet, swallow hole, or doline (the different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably, according to Wikipedia. The largest sinkhole in the world is in Cairo, Egypt and measures 80 kilometres long and 120 kilometres wide."

Article content The 23-metre deep sinkhole opened up at the intersection of 61 Avenue and 109 Street last October. Epcor spokeswoman Laura Ehrkamp said Thursday the hole was caused by a 2.5 metre hole opening in the top of a sewer trunk line located under the street. This caused the materials around the hole to erode, creating a deep void. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Specialty pipe from Dubai arrives for south Edmonton sinkhole fix, work expected to be completed in July Back to video Ehrkamp said the exact cause of the trunk line opening cannot be confirmed but it is believed hydrogen sulphide gas present in the sanitary system may have caused erosion of the sewer line. Due to the unique oval shape of the trunk line, crews were challenged to find the correct product for the repairs. Epcor reached out to several companies and found the pipe from Dubai was the best fit. Ehrkamp said she could not disclose the cost of the pipe due to confidential procurement processes.

Article content “Very few companies in the world manufacture non-circular fiberglass pipes such as these,” said Ehrkamp in an email. “Ordering the pipe from Dubai was determined to be the best option, given that the manufacturer was able to construct and deliver the custom pipe in accordance with the unique specifications and in the shortest time frame.” The pipe has been delivered to Edmonton and is scheduled to be installed next month. When the sinkhole opened, the utility company said it expected to have work completed on it by May 2021. It now believes the intersection will reopen in late July. “Emergencies are not predictable. Initial timeline estimates in an emergency are always tentative, as the condition of the assets are unknown and the full scope of work could expand as the emergency evolves,” said Ehrkamp. Ehrkamp said a ground stabilization study found additional air pockets existed after crews had worked to fill the void around the trunk line. She said the cold temperatures the city experienced in February also caused stabilization work to be delayed. “We recognize the delay continues to affect traffic flow in the area and we thank motorists, residents and area business owners for their patience and understanding while our crews continue to complete this emergency work,” said Ehrkamp.

Both High Springs Fire Department and Alachua County Fire Rescue were dispatched to the scene.
After about two hours, High Springs Fire Department Lieutenant Kevin Pearson descended into the hole to rescue the goat.
Eleven minutes later, the baby goat was safely pulled out of the sinkhole and reunited with its mother, uninjured.
According to Mangan, the firefighters from both agencies are in a weeklong rescue class being held in High Springs.","mangan, baby, springs, sinkhole, firefighters, mother, rescue, rescued, king, 40foot, goat, animal, high",sinkhole,geophysical event,"A nine-week-old goat fell into a sinkhole over 40 feet deep in High Springs on Monday afternoon.

Both High Springs Fire Department and Alachua County Fire Rescue were dispatched to the scene.

Jason King, the owner of the goat, is unsure how the animal fell into the sinkhole. He thinks the baby may have been nibbling on a grass root too near to the edge and lost balance.

At around 4:51 p.m., King was washing the walls of his house outdoors when he heard the stress cry of the goat mother. He proceeded to call 911 for animal rescue.

Upon arrival, firefighters worked to develop a rescue plan that would ensure the safety of the animal and themselves.

While this was happening, the goat mother was running around in distress, according to King.

After about two hours, High Springs Fire Department Lieutenant Kevin Pearson descended into the hole to rescue the goat.

Eleven minutes later, the baby goat was safely pulled out of the sinkhole and reunited with its mother, uninjured.

Speaking of the rescue, King was astonished by the work of the firefighters.

“It was beyond what I imagined,” King said. “They got right down to it and were able to pull the baby back up.”

“While we never want to get these types of calls, the timing of Monday’s event was perfect,” High Springs spokesperson Kevin Mangan said.

According to Mangan, the firefighters from both agencies are in a weeklong rescue class being held in High Springs.

“Calls like these are the exact reason our crews spend countless hours together every year, training, learning and adapting,” Mangan said."

“Heavy rainfall throughout the day has created several delays and made the repair-work on the water main pipe at Genevafontein very challenging.

SMITHSBURG — A sinkhole appeared in a yard Wednesday night at 13174 Edgemont Road north of Smithsburg, according to emergency officials.

Rick Eichelberger, Washington County's director of construction, confirmed that a building inspector went to the site Wednesday.

The sinkhole was about 25 feet from the house, he said.

""At the time we were there, there did not appear to be any danger to the structure,"" Eichelberger said Thursday morning.

The hole, which appeared to be possibly less than 20 feet in diameter, was covered with a piece of plywood Thursday afternoon. A man outside the house declined to comment.

Because the sinkhole is on private property, it will be the landowner's responsibility to take care of it, Eichelberger said. That usually means calling in an engineer to recommend a solution.

Typically, he said, sinkholes are caused when soil falls into large holes cause by water flowing underground.

""It's not surprising with all the runoff and snow melting,"" said David Yankey, chief of the Smithsburg Community Volunteer Fire Co.

Yankey said firefighters roped off the sinkhole until other authorities arrived.
