Shortly after Biden won the U.S. presidential election in November, the EU proposed teaming up with his administration to squeeze China out of the global technology trade.
Also on Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi virtually attended a meeting of EU foreign ministers, where he indirectly criticized China's role in the Indo-Pacific region.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, told a press conference that EU foreign ministers also discussed China's crackdown on the democracy movement in Hong Kong with Motegi.

Xi's virtual address to the World Economic Forum comes as China is making a show of power and setting out its red lines to the new American leader. Over the weekend, Taiwan reported a large incursion by Chinese bombers and jet fighters for two days in a row.

While Biden's team has called for the formation of an alliance of democracies to confront China's economic model, Xi cautioned against the dangers of such an approach.

""Forming small groups or launching new cold wars on the world stage; excluding, threatening and intimidating others; resorting to decoupling, supply disruption or sanctions ... would only push the world towards division, if not confrontation,"" Xi said.

""Repeatedly, history and the reality reminded us that, if we walk down the path of confrontation — be it a cold war, a hot war, a trade war or a tech war — all countries are going to suffer in terms of their interests and their people’s well-being,"" he added.

Xi's pre-recorded speech came a day after the White House said Biden and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, talked on the phone and ""agreed to work together on shared foreign policy priorities, including China.""

The prospect of greater transatlantic collaboration in relation to Beijing has prompted China to make some pre-emptive moves, most prominently by offering EU countries unprecedented market access in a comprehensive investment agreement last month.

Shortly after Biden won the U.S. presidential election in November, the EU proposed teaming up with his administration to squeeze China out of the global technology trade.

The European Commission subsequently proposed a ""Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council"" to set joint standards on new technologies, in a bid to prevent China from establishing economic dominance across a number of high-value sectors by developing its own widely used technological and industrial standards.

Xi shot back at the assertion, saying: ""The fruit of technology should benefit the whole of humanity, but not become the tools to restrict and suppress the development of other countries.""

Over the weekend, Biden made phone calls to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Macron. On both occasions, he brought up the need for the U.S. to work with Europe on China policy.

Also on Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi virtually attended a meeting of EU foreign ministers, where he indirectly criticized China's role in the Indo-Pacific region.

He noted the worsening situation of democracy and human rights in the region as well as the security challenges in the East China Sea and South China Sea, according to the Japanese foreign ministry.

""We welcome the growing interest in the Indo-Pacific in Europe,"" he added.

Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, told a press conference that EU foreign ministers also discussed China's crackdown on the democracy movement in Hong Kong with Motegi.

1,2021-01-25 00:00:00,China’s Xi warns against ‘new Cold War’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/25/chinas-xi-warns-against-new-cold-war-at-davos,"Xi Jinping said attempts to ‘threaten’ or ‘intimidate’ others will further divide the world.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned global leaders against starting a “new Cold War” and urged unity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
“To build small cliques or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others … will only push the world into division,” said Xi at an all-virtual Davos forum on Monday.
The words appeared to be aimed at US President Joe Biden’s plans to revitalise global alliances to counter China’s growing influence.
“We should build an open world economy … discard discriminatory and exclusionary standards, rules and systems, and take down barriers to trade, investment and technological exchanges,” he said.","war, china, economy, international, davos, global, forum, chinas, worlds, xi, trade, warns, cold, world",war,Military Conflicts,"Xi Jinping said attempts to ‘threaten’ or ‘intimidate’ others will further divide the world.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned global leaders against starting a “new Cold War” and urged unity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

“To build small cliques or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others … will only push the world into division,” said Xi at an all-virtual Davos forum on Monday.

The words appeared to be aimed at US President Joe Biden’s plans to revitalise global alliances to counter China’s growing influence. Biden, busy handling several urgent domestic crises, did not participate at Davos and tasked US climate envoy John Kerry with representing Washington.

In a swipe at moves targeting China launched by the previous US administration under Donald Trump, Xi said confrontation “will always end up harming every nation’s interests and sacrificing people’s welfare”.

Xi, making his first appearance at the forum since his vigorous defence of free trade and globalisation in an address in Davos in 2017, advocated multilateralism as the way out of current challenges in a roughly 25-minute speech.

“We should build an open world economy … discard discriminatory and exclusionary standards, rules and systems, and take down barriers to trade, investment and technological exchanges,” he said.

The G20 – an international forum grouping 19 of the biggest developed and emerging economies, plus the European Union – should be strengthened as the “main forum for global economic governance” and the world should “engage in closer macroeconomic policy coordination”, Xi added.

The international community should be governed in accordance with rules and consensus reached by all countries, instead of by one or several issuing orders, he said, without naming the countries.





Under Trump, tensions simmered between the US and China, the world’s top two economies, on issues ranging from trade and technology to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the coronavirus.

The Chinese leader also reaffirmed Beijing’s ambitious climate pledges to slash carbon emissions by 65 per cent by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 – both significant commitments as China emits a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gases.

“Meeting these targets will require tremendous hard work from China. But we believe that when the interests of the entire humanity are at stake, China must step forward, take action and get the job done,” he said.

Economic growth

China saw its GDP increase 2.3 percent last year, according to official data – the lowest growth rate since 1976 – but it is nonetheless expected to be the only major economy to have expanded in the pandemic-ravaged year.

Its economy is forecast to grow by 7.9 per cent in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund – trimmed down from initial predictions by a harsh geopolitical climate, global economic downturn and risks from a messy technological decoupling from the US.

It also overtook the US as the world’s biggest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2020, according to a UN report released on Sunday.

However, despite having controlled the pandemic within its border, and kickstarting the economy, the Chinese government has been accused of mishandling the initial coronavirus outbreak and covering up information.

A World Health Organization expert team is currently conducting a long-delayed probe into the origins of the virus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019."

3,2021-01-08 00:00:00,Woman believed to be last remaining widow of US civil war soldier dies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/08/last-civil-war-widow-dies-helen-viola-jackson,"Bolin was also a civil war veteran who fought for the Union in the border state of Missouri.
Jackson was almost certainly the last remaining widow of a civil war soldier when she died on 16 December at a nursing home in Marshfield, Missouri.
Bolin, a widower who had served as a private in the 14th Missouri Cavalry during the civil war seven decades earlier, lived nearby.
She mentioned in passing that he fought in the civil war.
What do you mean he was in the civil war?”’ Inman said.","war, believed, missouri, marriage, wedding, jacksons, remaining, woman, bolin, bolins, soldier, inman, dies, widow, civil, jackson",war,Military Conflicts,"Helen Viola Jackson’s 1936 marriage to James Bolin was unusual to say the least: he was 93 and in declining health, and she was a 17-year-old schoolgirl.

Bolin was also a civil war veteran who fought for the Union in the border state of Missouri. Jackson was almost certainly the last remaining widow of a civil war soldier when she died on 16 December at a nursing home in Marshfield, Missouri. She was 101.

Several civil war heritage organizations have recognized Jackson’s quiet role in history, one that she hid for all but the final three years of her life, said Nicholas Inman, her pastor and longtime friend. Yet in those final years, Inman said, Jackson embraced the recognition that included a spot on the Missouri Walk of Fame and countless cards and letters from well-wishers.

“It was sort of a healing process for Helen: that something she thought would be kind of a scarlet letter would be celebrated in her later years,” Inman said.

Jackson grew up one of 10 children in the tiny south-western Missouri town of Niangua, near Marshfield. Bolin, a widower who had served as a private in the 14th Missouri Cavalry during the civil war seven decades earlier, lived nearby.

Jackson’s father volunteered his teenage daughter to stop by Bolin’s home each day to provide care and help with chores. To pay back her kindness, Bolin offered to marry Jackson, which would allow her to receive his soldier’s pension after his death, a compelling offer in the context of the Great Depression.

Jackson agreed in large part because “she felt her daily care was prolonging his life,” Inman said.

They wed on 4 September 1936, at his home. Throughout their three years of marriage there was no intimacy and she never lived with him. She never told her parents, her siblings or anyone else about the wedding. She never remarried, spending decades “harboring this secret that had to be eating her alive,” Inman said.

After Bolin’s death in 1939, she did not seek his pension.

She also realized the stigma and potential scandal of a teenager wedding a man in his 90s, regardless of her reason. In an oral history recording in 2018, Jackson said she never spoke of the wedding to protect Bolin’s reputation as well as her own.

“I had great respect for Mr Bolin, and I did not want him to be hurt by the scorn of wagging tongues,” she said.

Inman and Jackson were longtime friends. She was a charter member of the Methodist church where he serves as pastor. One day in December 2017, she told Inman about her secret marriage to a much older man. She mentioned in passing that he fought in the civil war.

“I said, ‘What? Back up about that. What do you mean he was in the civil war?”’ Inman said.

Inman checked into her story and found that everything she told him was “spot on”.

Officials at Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield sent him copies of Bolin’s service information. She identified where he was buried, in Niangua.

She also kept a Bible that he gave her, in which he wrote about their marriage. Those written words were good enough for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and other heritage organizations to recognize Jackson’s place in history.

After a lifetime of avoiding her past, Jackson embraced it in her final years, Inman said. She spoke to schoolchildren and had a Facebook page dedicated to her. She enjoyed getting cards and letters.

She also found new peace. A stoic nature that kept her from shedding tears at her own siblings’ funerals seemed to evaporate.

After Bolin’s relatives found out about Jackson’s role in his life, they went to the nursing home and presented her with a framed photo of him.

“She broke down and cried,” Inman recalled. “She kept touching the frame and said, ‘This is the only man who ever loved me.”’

Georgia lost control of those territories following wars in the early 1990s, and Russia formally recognized both as independent countries following the 2008 war.
“The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Georgia’s claims against Russia in the August 2008 war in South Ossetia were unfounded,” the lede of its story went.
It is the second case that Georgia has won against Russia in the court.
In 2014, the ECHR ruled in favor of Georgia in a case regarding the mass expulsions of Georgians from Russia in 2006.","war, rules, following, violations, european, responsible, georgia, south, crimes, court, ruling, russian, control, fighting, 2008, russia",war,Military Conflicts,"Russia is responsible for human rights violations in the aftermath of the 2008 war with Georgia over South Ossetia, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled.

The long-awaited ruling was hailed in Georgia. Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said in a tweet that it marked “one of the most important days in the recent history of Georgia … this victory was inevitable and belongs to each and every Georgian.”

The case, filed by Georgia in 2009, sought to hold Russia responsible for a wide variety of human rights violations during and after the war in August 2008. The violations primarily related to the mistreatment and torture of Georgian prisoners and the refusal to let Georgians displaced by the fighting return to their homes.

The court ruled that Russia was not responsible for violations during the fighting from August 8-12, including “killings, ill-treatment, looting and burning of homes,” because while the fighting was going on, Russia could not be said to have exercised “effective control” over the battlefield.

“[T]he very reality of armed confrontation and fighting between enemy military forces seeking to establish control over an area in a context of chaos not only meant that there was no ‘effective control’ over that area, but also excluded any form of ‘State agent authority and control’ over individuals,” the court wrote in a summary of the January 21 ruling. The situation changed once the fighting stopped, the court ruled: “After that period, the strong Russian presence and the South Ossetian and Abkhazian authorities’ dependency on the Russian Federation indicated that there had been continued ‘effective control’ over South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”

It continued: “Despite the order given to the Russian armed forces to protect the population and carry out peacekeeping and law-enforcement operations on the ground, the measures taken by the Russian authorities had proved insufficient to prevent the alleged violations. This could be deemed to be ‘official tolerance’ by the Russian authorities, as was also shown by the fact that the latter had not carried out effective investigations into the alleged violations.”

The ruling will have little practical effect, and no penalty was imposed. But it will be a symbolic victory for Tbilisi against its overbearing neighbor to the north, and will bolster its argument that Russia is an “occupant” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgia lost control of those territories following wars in the early 1990s, and Russia formally recognized both as independent countries following the 2008 war. Moscow now heavily backs both de facto governments financially and militarily and Georgia refuses to negotiate directly with either, insisting that they are merely Russian puppets.

Russia is & has always been an occupier. Great to have this recognized by @ECHR_CEDH in its final verdict on the August 2008 war. https://t.co/ThIl2xHe2u — Helen Khoshtaria (@Helenkhosh) January 21, 2021

An ECHR ruling in 2015 determined similarly that Armenia exercised “effective control” over Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories controlled by ethnic Armenian forces. Azerbaijan had used that ruling to bolster its case that the de facto Karabakh government was not an independent actor but was in fact occupied by Armenia.

The new ruling may also open up possibilities for Georgian victims to pursue legal remedies against Russia.

Russia’s Justice Ministry chose to focus on the positive in the ruling, emphasizing in a statement that the court had absolved Russia of responsibility for violations during the fighting. It also pointed out that the court had contradicted the official Georgian claim that Russia started the war; the ECHR ruling said the fighting began when “Georgian forces launched an artillery attack on the city of Tskhinvali, the administrative capital of South Ossetia.”

The official news agency of South Ossetia’s de facto government went a step farther. “The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Georgia’s claims against Russia in the August 2008 war in South Ossetia were unfounded,” the lede of its story went.

It is the second case that Georgia has won against Russia in the court. In 2014, the ECHR ruled in favor of Georgia in a case regarding the mass expulsions of Georgians from Russia in 2006."

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell 10.3% in 2020, the largest drop in emissions in the post-World War II era, as the coronavirus crippled the economy, according to a report released Tuesday by the Rhodium Group.

The drop means that the United States would outperform its pledge made under the Copenhagen climate accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Emissions will actually drop by 21.5% compared with 2005.

But the report's authors warned that the dip should not be seen as a guarantee that the United States can easily meet its more ambitious pledge under the Paris climate agreement to cut emissions 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.

President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris accord, but President-elect Joe Biden has said he intends to rejoin as soon as he is inaugurated on Jan. 20. He plans to set the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050 but will first need to announce a target for reducing emissions by 2030.

""With coronavirus vaccines now in distribution, we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy, emissions will likely rise again as well,"" the report by the research group said.

Leading the decline was the transportation sector, which saw a sharp emissions drop of 14.7% from 2019 levels as travel diminished, especially at the start of the pandemic last March, the report said.

Power plant emissions saw the second largest decline, dropping 10.3% below 2019 levels, driven by retirements of coal-fired power plants and a general decline in electricity demand due to the economic damage from the pandemic, the report said.

Dave Grohl has stated that “Waiting on a War” was inspired by a conversation with his 11-year-old daughter: “Last fall, as I was driving my daughter to school, she turned to me and asked, ​‘Daddy, is there going to be a war?’ My heart sank as I realized that she was now living under the same dark cloud that I had felt 40 years ago.

First order to the military of the year

Official state-run media Xinhua reported that Xi, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to strengthen their training further to hone its operational capability and combat preparedness.

They were told to follow the Xin Jinping Thought on Socialism with Characteristics for a New Era, a set of Xi's policies and ideals, as their guiding principle as well.

It was the first order of the year to the armed forces, as they embarked on the first military exercises of 2021.

Since Jan. 3, 2018, when Xi ordered the PLA to strengthen its military training and raise its combat capability, he has been giving such orders on the first working day after the New Year holiday, Lianhe Zaobao reported.

2021's orders a departure from before

Citing a source in Beijing supposedly close to the Chinese military personnel, Zaobao further said while such orders typically include instructions to raise the forces' combat capability, they could change depending on the particular year's circumstance too.

For instance, this year's opening order differs from previous years' orders in that the armed forces were told to strengthen real life combat training, as well as ""frontline"" military training.

In other words, they were requested to prepare themselves for war at any moment.

This was a shift from 2020, when Xi's order to the PLA was to remain highly alert and deter war from happening.

The change is largely due to the need to curb any possible moves from Taiwan to declare independence, the source added.

Medicine at Midnight is the Foo Fighters’ 10th studio album and follows their 2017 album, Concrete and Gold.","war, album, wrote, day, midnight, daughter, grohl, song, waiting, medicine, foo, fighters, drop",war,Military Conflicts,"The Foo Fighters have released a new song, “Waiting on a War,” from their upcoming album, Medicine at Midnight, which is set to arrive February 5th.

The track begins as an aching ballad with frontman Dave Grohl singing over a steady acoustic strum as strings linger in the background. Toward the end of the song, the electric guitars finally arrive, leading the track to its epic conclusion as Grohl repeats the refrain, “Just waiting on a war for this and that/There’s got to be more to this than that.”

In a statement, Grohl explained that the song was inspired by a frank and somewhat unnerving conversation he’d had with his daughter: “Last fall, as I was driving my daughter to school, she turned to me and asked, ‘Daddy, is there going to be a war?’ My heart sank as I realized that she was now living under the same dark cloud that I had felt 40 years ago. I wrote ‘Waiting on a War’ that day. Every day waiting for the sky to fall. Is there more to this than that? Is there more to this than just waiting on a war? Because I need more. We all do. This song was written for my daughter, Harper, who deserves a future, just as every child does.”

Grohl echoed that sentiment in a series of tweets posted Wednesday, January 13th, where he recounted the looming threat of war that came especially with growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., during the height of the Cold War. “I had nightmares of missiles in the sky and soldiers in my backyard, most likely brought upon by the political tension of the early Eighties and my proximity to the Nation’s Capitol,” Grohl wrote. “My youth was spent under the dark cloud of a hopeless future.”

“Waiting on a War” marks the third offering from Medicine at Midnight, following “No Son of Mine,” which was released on New Year’s Day, and “Shame Shame,” which arrived last November. Medicine at Midnight is the Foo Fighters’ 10th studio album and follows their 2017 album, Concrete and Gold."

The mostly-acoustic song was inspired by a disheartening conversation singer Dave Grohl had with his daughter Harper last fall that reminded him of his own fears of nuclear annihilation when he was her age.

“Last fall, as I was driving my daughter to school, she turned to me and asked, ‘Daddy, is there going to be a war?,'” Grohl said in a statement. “My heart sank as I realized that she was now living under the same dark cloud that I had felt 40 years ago. I wrote ‘Waiting on a War’ that day. Everyday waiting for the sky to fall. Is there more to this than that? Is there more to this than just waiting on a war? Because I need more. We all do.”

Grohl dedicated the song to Harper, who he said, “deserves a future, just as every child does.”

The pain, fear and hope Grohl talks about feeds the song’s simple, but high-impact lyrics, which open with the lines, “I’ve been waiting on a war since I was young/ Since I was a little boy with a toy gun/ Never really wanted to be number one/ Just wanted to love everyone,” which tumbles into the affecting chorus, “Is there more to this than that? (x3)/ Is there more to this than/ Just waiting on a war?”

The four-minute Greg Kurstin-produced song, which features acoustic guitar, strings and subtle bass and drums, picks up the pace and intensity as it moves through a second verse about waiting for the sky to fall and scenes of a little boy lost turning to the radio for solace. The final minute of the track then explodes into a patented Foos rager, as the languid pace triples up and the song charges to a frenzied, cathartic conclusion.

“War” is the third track the band has released from the nine-track, 37-minute album so far, following on the heels of “No Son of Mine” and “Shame Shame. Medicine at Midnight is due Feb. 5.

Dave Grohl and co have shared the next cut to come from their Medicine At Midnight album, while the frontman has revealed the inspiration behind the track.

Foo Fighters have released their Waiting On A War single.

The track is the next cut to be taken from their Medicine At Midnight album, which is set for release on 5 February 2021.

It follows the band's previously released lead single Shame Shame, and was inspired by Grohl's fear of war due to his proximity to Washington DC as well as a conversation he had with his middle daughter Harper.

The Foos frontman took to Twitter to share his inspiration for the song in a post, which began: ""As a child growing up in the suburbs of Washington DC, I was always afraid of war. I had nightmares of missiles in the sky and soldiers in my backyard, most likely brought upon by the political tension of the early 1980’s and my proximity to the Nation’s Capitol.My youth was spent under the dark cloud of a hopeless future.""

He continued: ""Last fall, as I was driving my 11 year old daughter to school she turned to me and ashed, ""Daddy, is there going to be a war?"" My heart sank in my chest as I looked into her innocent eyes, because I realized that she was now living under that same dark cloud of a hopeless future that I had felt 40 years ago.

""I wrote 'Waiting On a War"" that day.

""Everyday waiting for the sky to fall. Is there more to this than that? Is there more to this than just waiting on a war? Because I need more. We all do.

""This song was written for my daughter, Harper, who deserves a future, just as every child does.

""Dave"".

Waiting On A War isn't the only work from the band's 10th studio album which is heavily inspired by Grohl's childhood.

Speaking to Radio X's George Godfrey last year, the rocker explained:

""So a dream I had when I was 14 or 15 I was standing at this hill and there was a coffin on fire at the top of this hill next to this dead tree, so I go running up to the coffin and I'm trying to open it to save whoever is in it and I'm like burning my hands and whatever.

""But I had lived through this dream my entire life and finally when I wrote the song, I thought 'Oh my god I think I've finally wrote a song about this dream that I had when I was 14.""

The sculpture was erected in memory of civilians killed in the final phase of the civil war in 2009.

A tense situation continued at the Jaffna University on Saturday, as dozens of locals, students, and politicians gathered overnight, protesting the removal of a war memorial on campus.

According to students and eyewitnesses, on Friday night university authorities bulldozed a sculpture, of hands held out of water, erected in memory of several thousand civilians brutally killed in the final phase of the civil war in 2009, in Mullivaikkal in Sri Lanka’s northern Mullaitivu district. “We heard about this move to destroy the memorial and I rushed from my home in Vavuniya and got here at 2 a.m. Students and some local politicians had gathered here, and there was a heavy police presence,” said Pakianathan Ujanthan, President of the Jaffna Students’ Union. “Despite the police and army in and around our premises, we continued the protests outside. Later, when police told us they would subject us to PCR tests, we decided to suspend our agitation,” he said.

Following early reports of the development, social media users expressed shock, terming it an attack on Tamils’ attempt to memorialise, and an attempt by the Sri Lankan state “to erase” the troubling history around the massacre of scores of civilians.

When contacted, S.W.M. Senarathne, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, Jaffna, said: “The decision to demolish the unauthorised structure was taken by the university administration. Our personnel were deployed there only after we heard students were gathering outside the campus last night. In this pandemic period, it is our responsibility to prevent such gatherings.” The memorial, local media reports said, was erected in 2019, to mark the 10th anniversary of the civil war. “Since then, authorities have been asking the university administration to remove the unauthorised structure. I received multiple instructions from higher authorities, and this was discussed at several meetings with the university’s capital works, engineering and maintenance departments,” said University Vice-Chancellor S. Srisatkunarajah, who assumed charge in August 2020.

Asked who the higher authorities were, he said: “Defence, intelligence, Education Ministry, everyone. I am a civilian carrying out an administrative responsibility. Sometimes, I have to take decisions beyond my personal likes and dislikes,” he told The Hindu . “So, I delegated the responsibility to the concerned departments about a month ago, giving no particular date. They have executed it, that is all.”

Memorialisation has been a sensitive and contentious issue in Sri Lanka, with many instances of the state and its security apparatus preventing families from remembering their loved ones. While defending affected families’ right to remember the dead, some within the Tamil community, including university academics, have in the past questioned the “politicisation” of memorial events, in Sri Lanka’s post-war context.

Jaffna University lecturer Mahendran Thiruvarangan wrote on Facebook: “I have a number of issues with the Tamil nationalist commemoration processes that take place at the University of Jaffna…it is a conversation that needs to happen within the academic community. Demolishing, in the stealth of the night, a monument commemorating thousands of people who died during the last stages of the war cannot be justified under any circumstances. This is nothing but a high-handed, chauvinistic act by the state.”

Jaffna parliamentarian S. Shritharan described the developments as “very disturbing.” “This is a deliberate, provocative act, knowing well that memorials are to do with people’s emotions. After a relatively peaceful period here, this act will trigger much pain and anger, especially among our youth. That is very worrying,” he said. “I also feel the state has tactfully used the VC to carry out this, pitting some Tamils against others, while achieving what they want,” he added."

Hundreds of Islamist fighters, or “mujahideen”, came from North Africa and the Middle East to help the mainly Muslim Bosnian government forces fight separatist Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats during the war, in which 100,000 people died.

The court was set up in 2005 to ease the burden of cases taken by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
After the war ended, foreign Islamists were ordered to leave Bosnia under U.S. pressure and most did, including those who married local women but then had their citizenship revoked.","war, foreign, islamist, sarajevo, crimes, bosnian, serb, prisoners, court, serbs, muslim, jailed, fighters, excommander, bosnia, islamists",war,Military Conflicts,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia’s war crimes court on Friday jailed Bosnian Muslim wartime commander Sakib Mahmuljin for 10 years for failing to prevent or punish atrocities against Serb prisoners by foreign Islamists who fought in the 1990s conflict.

Hundreds of Islamist fighters, or “mujahideen”, came from North Africa and the Middle East to help the mainly Muslim Bosnian government forces fight separatist Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats during the war, in which 100,000 people died.

Mahmuljin, 68, was convicted in a five-year-long trial of failing to prevent or punish killings and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners of war, some of whom were wounded or ill, and some Serb civilians, the Sarajevo court said.

In its verdict, the court said it determined that foreign Islamists murdered 53 Serb prisoners of war from July to October 1995, towards the end of the war. During this period, they tortured some prisoners and decapitated one of them, it said.

Mahmuljin, who commanded the Bosnian army’s 3rd Corps, may appeal the verdict.

The court was set up in 2005 to ease the burden of cases taken by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

The war erupted when Bosnian Serbs, rejecting the proclamation of independence of Bosnia from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia, attacked cities and villages across the country in a bid to carve out territory for an exclusive Serb state.

The U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement ended the conflict in December 1995 by splitting Bosnia into two largely autonomous regions along ethnic lines.

After the war ended, foreign Islamists were ordered to leave Bosnia under U.S. pressure and most did, including those who married local women but then had their citizenship revoked."

Between 1954 and 1962, Algerian revolutionaries and French forces engaged in a bloody war in which both sides committed war crimes but that ultimately led to the independence of the North African country.



Macron said France has ""no repentance nor apologies"" for its occupation of Algeria or its actions during the eight-year war. He said the French government instead will undertake ""symbolic acts"" to make up for its past deeds.



Nearly 60 years on, the war continues to strain French-Algieran ties, prompting France to put in efforts at restoring cordial relations.



So far, Macron has been the only French president to recognize France's criminal involvement in colonial Algeria.



During his presidential campaign in 2017, he described France's 132-year colonization of Algeria as a ""crime against humanity"" during an interview with an Algerian television channel. Macron's comment caused a stir in France and was widely criticized by the far right.



In 2018, he acknowledged that French forces used torture during the Algerian war — the first time any French leader had made such an admission.



He tasked a French historian, Benjamin Stora, to assess the European country's dealings in Algeria and propose ways of reconciliation. The report is expected to be published later Wednesday.



The Elysee Palace said Macron will take part in a three-day commemorative event next year to mark the 60th anniversary since the end of the war in Algeria.

For the first time in Call of Duty history, Treyarch’s Zombies mode will be available for free on PS4 through the Zombies Free Access Week. This free access period will be available to all players through the PlayStation Store and includes the following game modes:

Cranked Zombies

Need a Zombies experience with a bit more urgency? Then give Cranked Zombies a try.

Just like in regular Die Maschine, you’ll be airlifted in with a weapon of your choice within a loadout. However, once the first Zombie hits the floor, the clock starts ticking away. Your Operator will automatically go down if they fail to kill another Zombie within a short period of time.

Keep watch of the clock – and your six – to survive this fast-paced variation of the traditional Zombies game mode.

Onslaught (PlayStation exclusive*)

Those who have a PlayStation can access Onslaught, a fast-paced two-player Zombies experience on Black Ops Cold War’s Multiplayer maps.

In this mode, your duo will use your loadouts to fight against hyper-aggressive waves of undead forces. Unlike traditional Zombies, a Dark Aether Orb will confine you to a specific space on the map until it is charged by the souls of the undead.

As the safe area shifts, expect increasingly difficult surges of enemies, including incredibly powerful Elites, to test your duo’s survival skills. Slay enough of these Elites, and you’ll earn special medals and exclusive* weapon blueprints.

Die Maschine

An abandoned Polish laboratory containing a massive particle collider has opened a rift into a dimension that contains unexplainable monstrosities and undead forces. As part of the international faction known as Requiem, you will infiltrate and try to survive through waves of zombies through multiple rounds as you either uncover the secrets of Die Maschine or exfiltrate early with your life intact (and some great rewards to boot).

Based on the original Zombies map Nacht der Untoten, Die Maschine is the classic Zombies experience where up to four operators can drop in and attempt to survive the horrors that lie in wait. Work together by using dozens of weapons, lethal and tactical equipment pieces, shock-and-awe inducing Scorestreaks, and Field Upgrades, special loadout items such as an Energy Mine or an instant-heal through the Healing Aura that charge up from killing Zombies.

Have you unlocked some Black Ops Cold War weapons while playing Warzone? Bring them into the fight through your starting loadout and upgrade them along the way with Salvage dropped by Zombies. You can also outfit yourself with a variety of wall weapons, take a chance with a random weapon pulled from the mystery box, or give any weapon a serious boost through the Pack-a-Punch Machine.

And to those Zombies diehards that have been enjoying these modes since launch, know that the Dark Aether storyline is far from over…

Released in November last year, Cold War has been progressing smoothly with consistent updates – at least, for the time being.

And now, with the launch of Season 1, things have been kicked up a notch. Especially because it heralds the long-awaited integration between Warzone and Black Ops Cold War.

We are now able to jump into all of the beloved Warzone action that it has to offer, including the brand new Rebirth Island map. The integration between Warzone and Black Ops Cold War brings back a lot of the features players have grown accustomed to, including the immersive Gunsmith mechanic, meaning you will be able to fully deck out your loadouts all season long.

Loadouts are a vital feature of Warzone , and it can be tricky to figure out what works and what doesn’t. But do not fear, as we are going to highlight some of the best loadouts we have found in Black Ops Cold War . As a note, for the purpose of this piece, we will only be taking a look at the weapons from Black Ops Cold War .

Let’s take a closer look.

Loadouts at a glance

Stoner 63 LMG

AK-47 Assault Rifle

MP5 SMG

XM4 Assault Rifle

M16 Tactical Rifle

Stoner 63 LMG

Stoner 63

Attachments – 125 Round Fast Magazine, Field Agent Grip, 20.7 Match Grade, Sight of your choice and Suppressor of your choice

Galas Spas 12

Tactical Mask, Ghost, and Gearhead

Semtex or C4

Stimshot

Kicking off our list is one of the weapons you may have been on the wrong side of the last month during Multiplayer matches. The Stoner 63 is perhaps the best LMG within Cold War, and its presence is going to carry over into Warzone for Season 1. One of its key features is its high damage rate. Although similar to other LMGs in terms of ADS and reload times, the Stoner 63 tears opponents down more quickly.

We opted for the specific attachments as they offer a generous return in terms of ADS time and damage, for little cost. This setup will be your best bet at long range encounters, and the 125 Fast Round Magazine is one of the best options for this setup.

The chosen perks and other categories are going to be a constant throughout this loadout guide, for the most part. Ghost is perhaps the most important perk in all of Warzone, as you do not want to be seen by enemy UAVs. Tactical Mask, on the other hand, reduces the effectiveness of stun grenades and Flashbangs – items you’ll surely come up against during the close quarter combat on the Rebirth Island map.

Semtex and Stimshot are the best options for Lethal/Tactical. The former is a sticky grenade that’ll be useful for numerous scenarios, both offensive and defensive. Stimshot will quickly heal you if you are stuck in a sweaty situation.

AK-47 Assault Rifle

AK-47

Attachments – Spetsnaz Compensator, 60 Round Fast Magazine, Sight of choice, Spetsnaz Grip and 18.2 Barrel

Gallos Spas-12

Tactical Mask, Ghost, and Gearhead

Semtex or C4

Stimshot

The beloved AK-47 has been noted as one of the best, if not the best Assault Rifle within Black Ops Cold War. It has dethroned the FFAR, which was heavily nerfed during the opening week of the game.

The AK-47 has one of the highest damage outputs on this list, and combined with a user-friendly recoil pattern, there seems to be no real downside to this weapon. As for attachments, this combination offers increased range, while decreasing the weapon’s overall recoil.

MP5 SMG

MP5

Attachments – 40 Round Drum Magazine, Suppressor, Field Agent Grip, 9.1 Barrel and No Stock

Gallos Spas-12

Tactical Mask, Ghost, and Gearhead

Semtex or C4

Stimshot

Moving on to one of the best close quarters weapons, the MP5 has once again solidified itself as the king of the SMGs. The MP5 was one of the most dominant weapons throughout the entirety of Modern Warfare, and now it is lined up to be one of the best weapons in Black Ops Cold War too.

In terms of attachments, we’ve opted for a close range combination and it’s most applicable for the new Rebirth Island map. We have opted for the same Perks and Tactical/Lethal choices as the previous loadouts. This is very much an offensive build, so the Ghost perk, combined with Semtex or C4 and Stimshot, will ensure you’re always ready for combat.

XM4 Tactical Assault Rifle

XM4

Attachments – 60 Round Magazine, Sight of your choice, Speedgrip, 13.7 Takedown Barrel, Compensator

Gallos Spas-12

Tactical Mask, Ghost, and Gearhead

Semtex or C4

Stimshot

The XM4 is the next weapon we are going to take a look at. Since the release of Black Ops Cold War, the XM4 has been deemed one of the most reliable weapons within Multiplayer mode. Like Modern Warfare’s M4, the XM4 deals an impressive amount of damage at all ranges, and has a steady recoil that is not too hard to handle. On top of that, it offers one of the best barrels in the entire game: the 13.7 Takedown. This provides you with an astounding 150 per cent increase in effective damage range, at a cost of only five per cent sprinting move speed. This setup will allow you to shred enemies at mid-distance, or easily get you out of a tight spot.

M16 Tactical Rifle

M16

Attachments – 20.5 Task Force Barrel, STANAG 60 Round Magazine, Airborne Elastic Wrap, Field Agent Foregrip and a sight of your choice

Gallos Spas-12

Tactical Mask, Ghost, and Gearhead

Semtex or C4

The M16 has become one of the most popular assault rifles in Black Ops Cold War thus far. Consistent damage combined with a steady recoil pattern makes this weapon more than formidable against opponents.

Attachments for your M16 depend on the situations you are looking to engage in, but for the most part, we have picked some safe bets. For starters, the 20.5 Task Force Barrel and 60 round magazine offer improved long-range damage with an increased magazine capacity. You can mix and match some of these choices, but this is a loadout that will get your through most encounters.

Biden also named veteran U.S. diplomat Timothy Lenderking as the U.S. special envoy for Yemen in a bid to step up American diplomacy “to end the war in Yemen, a war which has created humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.”

The United Nations describes Yemen as the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need and millions on the verge of a large-scale famine.

“This war has to end,” the Democratic president said during a visit to the U.S. State Department in Washington. “And to underscore our commitment, we’re ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.”

The move is a reversal of a policy of both the Democratic Obama and Republican Trump administrations. Biden was vice president in the Obama administration.

“At the same time,” he said on Thursday, “Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV (drone) strikes and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries. We’re going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.”

Saudi Arabia welcomed Biden’s remarks, particularly his commitment to the country’s defense and addressing threats against it, according to the country’s state news agency.

The Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

‘HOPE FOR YEMEN’

Under the Trump administration, policy on Yemen was secondary to a so-called “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against Iran in a bid to force Tehran back into talks over its nuclear and missile programs and activities in the Middle East.

Former President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a top aide, were also focused on maintaining their close ties with Saudi Arabia’s effective ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which included U.S. arms sales.

This was despite demands by Republican and Democratic lawmakers for an end to U.S. support for Riyadh as the civilian death toll in Yemen mounted and the humanitarian crisis worsened.

Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on Thursday that the end of U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition’s operations in Yemen does not extend to efforts to combat the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda militant group.

Sullivan said the Biden administration already had halted two sales of precision-guided munitions and kept regional allies in the region informed of actions to avoid surprises.

“Any move that reduces the number of weapons, military activity, is to be welcomed and will give more space and more hope not only to the talks, but importantly more hope to the people of Yemen,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.

The State Department is also reviewing a Trump administration designation last month of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.

The United Nations and aid groups have called for the designation to be reversed, warning it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine. The Biden administration last week approved all transactions involving Yemen’s Houthi movement for the next month as it carries out the review."

But the specifics of the new plan make clear Washington will still help Riyadh against Houthi rebels and other threats.

The US, then, isn’t totally out of the war. It’s just shifting into a new, less destructive posture.

Speaking at the State Department to deliver a foreign policy address on Thursday, Biden outlined America’s first real strategic shift on Yemen since the Obama administration, when he was vice president.

“We are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales,” Biden said. But then he added an important caveat: “At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV strikes, and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries. We’re going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.”

The US will also continue to fight terrorist groups in the country that directly threaten America like al-Qaeda or ISIS, a White House spokesperson told me on Friday. In other words, the US military will continue to operate in Yemen, but its focus will turn to terrorists that could plan attacks against the US.

The president also confirmed the appointment of Tim Lenderking as the administration’s special envoy for Yemen tasked with pursuing a diplomatic — not military — end to the fighting. “There is no military solution to the war in Yemen,” the White House spokesperson said.

These were pronouncements many Yemenis, activists, and humanitarians have long waited to hear.

Since 2015, the US has supported the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen against the Houthis and helped those forces push back on Iran, the Houthis’ main supplier for weapons and funds. Until November 2018, the US refueled Saudi warplanes that dropped bombs on Yemen — many of which killed civilians, including children. But the US continued to provide logistical and intelligence support and, during the Trump administration, aimed to sell $23 billion in advanced weapons like F-35 warplanes, Reaper drones, and bombs.

The war has created a humanitarian disaster. The United Nations estimated in December that about 233,000 people have died since fighting began, mostly from indirect causes such as lack of food, water, and health services. Meanwhile, another roughly 24 million Yemenis require assistance to stay alive and fend off diseases like cholera.

Experts hope America’s new Yemen approach won’t just end a dark chapter of US foreign policy, but will also save thousands of lives. “The Biden administration is signaling that it’s actually going to have a Yemen policy that is focused on Yemen” and not just cozying up to regional allies like Saudi Arabia or opposing adversaries like Iran, said Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s policy advocacy director. “It’s the right thing to do, and it will have a dramatic impact.”

But some fear the plan won’t work and may even make the situation worse. “There could be unintended consequences of our disengagement that could actually accelerate misery,” Dave Harden, who formerly led the humanitarian development response to Yemen as a US official, told me. While he is in favor of the end of US military support for the war, he fears that doing so means “the Houthis may actually expand and consolidate power.”

It’s therefore worth taking a closer look at what Biden announced, and what it might mean for one of the world’s worst wars and humanitarian crises.

Biden’s three-pronged Yemen policy, explained

The new policy has three elements: the end of “offensive operations” in Yemen, the continued support for Saudi Arabia’s defense, and a new push for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

Let’s start with the “offensive operations” part. Simply put, the US won’t help the Saudi-led coalition fight the Houthis in Yemen anymore. If Riyadh’s forces want to bomb positions within the country, they will do so without US help to refuel warplanes, collect intelligence, or target positions.

Furthermore, the US won’t sell weapons to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates — a top coalition member — that they could use during the war like the advanced warplanes or precision-guided munitions. Those would be the “relevant arms sales” Biden mentioned, the same ones he froze to conduct a review of them last month.

But that doesn’t mean the US will stop fighting in Yemen. Per the administration, it will continue to strike al-Qaeda and ISIS militants in the country to ensure they can’t use it as a base to hatch plots against America. The US has been targeting terrorists in Yemen, most of them against al-Qaeda, since 2002 and has killed around 1,000 people in strikes. Stopping that campaign, experts say, might give the terrorists more space to operate.

So ending support for the fight against the Houthis, and continuing the fight against America-threatening terrorists — that’s pretty straightforward. What isn’t as clear is what the second element, supporting Saudi Arabia’s defense, means in practice.

The biggest complication here is what defines an “offensive” versus a “defensive” move. Say the Houthis attack Saudi Arabia, which experts I spoke to expect they will continue to do. The rebels launched missiles at an airport and airbase in Saudi Arabia in 2019, and at Saudi oil stations last year. Under international law, Riyadh has the right to retaliate in a commensurate way.

Would the US help Saudi Arabia in such a retaliation?

For some experts, the ambiguity from Biden’s team here means the door for such support remains open. “I would’ve liked them to unequivocally say that the US is no longer going to be involved in Saudi aggression in Yemen,” said Annelle Sheline, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.

One reason the Biden administration allowed for ambiguity, she surmised, was to keep Saudi Arabia happy while the US seeks to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, which Riyadh opposes. Sheline worries Saudi Arabia could try to entice the US back into military support with claims that its actions are defensive in nature. “The whole war has been defensive in Saudi’s eyes,” she told me.

But providing defensive assistance isn’t just about Saudi Arabia’s well-being; it’s about naked US self interest, too.

America has thousands of troops stationed in the country to deter Iranian aggression in the region. And per January comments by Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the military chief for all US forces in the Middle East, America wants to expand the number of Saudi bases to place service members while tensions with Tehran remain high. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia possesses about 17 percent of the world’s proven petroleum reserves.

Protecting US troops in Saudi Arabia and the oil America may want to import, then, could explain why the Biden administration wants to support Saudi’s defensive operations, experts say.

Then there’s the third pillar: seeking an elusive diplomatic solution to the conflict. Biden elevated Lenderking, who was already a top diplomat handling the Yemen conflict, to a special envoy. That means the war isn’t just some problem among many for the administration — finding a resolution is a key concern, and so the president further empowered Lenderking to broker a deal.

“The main focus of our efforts will be the diplomatic effort to end the war in Yemen via the UN-led process to impose a ceasefire, open humanitarian channels, and restore long-dormant peace talks,” the White House spokesperson told me. “Our primary objective is to bring the parties together for a negotiated settlement that will end the war and the suffering of the Yemeni people.”

That’s easier said than done. Most experts say the Houthis are winning their fight against Saudi Arabia as they continue to control the capital, Sana’a, and capture more territory. As a result the rebels have little incentive to negotiate for peace because fighting for longer could increase their leverage in future talks. “The incentives are in the wrong place,” Sheline said.

It’s also not clear a deal to keep the Houthis in power will be welcomed by locals. Not only have they prolonged the suffering and fighting in the country, but there are credible allegations of Houthis torturing and raping women. “Some Yemenis see the Houthis as Nazis,” said Harden, now the managing director of the consultancy Georgetown Strategy Group.

Biden’s switch to this new strategy, then, won’t magically make the situation in Yemen better in the short term. “No American official can end the war in Yemen with the stroke of a pen,” said Oxfam’s Paul.

But most experts agree that ending America’s limited involvement in the conflict is a wise, though imperfect, move. Washington’s role in Yemen until now made the US complicit in a horrid war for years, and it’s better late than never to seek a less calamitous path."

We will leave aside the question of whether it makes sense to compare deaths from illness to wartime deaths. (Annual deaths from cancer top 600,000 in the United States.) We understand the metaphor — this is a battle against a deadly foe.

But is Biden’s math right?

The Facts

When Biden gave his inaugural address, the covid-19 death account was between 400,000 and 405,000, depending on the tracker you consulted. The total number of U.S. deaths from World War II was 405,399, according to the Congressional Research Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs. So that was close enough for government work, especially because the covid-19 death figures are probably undercounted.

Story continues below advertisement

That World War II figure included both battle deaths (291,557) and other deaths in service but not in theater (113,842).

So when we saw Biden’s latest statement, it did not make much sense. If you start with a base of 405,399 and add in World War I and the Vietnam War, using the same metrics of battlefield deaths and in-service deaths, you end up with many more than 500,000.

Advertisement

World War I: 116,516 deaths

World War II: 405,399

Vietnam: 58,220

That adds up to about 580,000.

(For Vietnam, Veterans Affairs also lists an additional 32,000 in-service but not-in-theater deaths, which would push the total above 600,000.)

Using just battlefield deaths, you come up with a much different number — about 392,000. That’s because more than half the deaths in World War I were not on the battlefield, in part because the 1918 flu pandemic at the time also claimed many lives in the military. But it would be pretty disingenuous for Biden to use a figure that included more than battlefield deaths in his inaugural address and then switch to a different metric just a month later, without noting the change in statistics.

Story continues below advertisement

Indeed, if Biden was using only battlefield deaths, he actually could have said more people died of covid-19 than in combat during all of America’s wars against foreign enemies. That’s because fewer than 500,000 died in battle if you add up every war from the Revolutionary War to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. (We’re obviously not counting the Civil War.)

Or if Biden had liked the sound of comparing covid-19 deaths to three wars, he would have been closer if he had added together all deaths from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. That yields a total of 500,193.

A White House official told The Fact Checker that the president intended to refer to combat deaths in World War I, World War II and Vietnam, which we noted is under 400,000, but he inadvertently omitted that qualifier in his remarks.

The Pinocchio Test

A president’s words have impact. The president’s death comparison to World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War ended up being cited in The Washington Post, the New York Times and many other news media. That’s because people assume when the president uses a figure like this, it’s been properly fact-checked, especially when speaking in a high-profile event like this.

Story continues below advertisement

Apparently, the president meant to refer to battlefield numbers in his remarks, even though he did not do so when he first made his war-to-covid comparison in his inaugural address. It’s confusing that the White House would change the metric like this, but that would be correct. At the very least, the White House needs to note the president’s mistake on the official transcript so that his math error does not keep getting repeated in news reports.

Dressed in a dapper blazer and tie and displaying his World War II medals, Moore struck a chord with locked-down Britons last year, as he walked up and down the garden of his home in Marston Moretaine, a small village around 50 miles north of London, to raise money for the National Health Service.

Having initially aimed to raise just 1,000 pounds ($1,400) he would go on to raise almost 33 million ($46 million).

With a mischievous wit and steely determination, he lifted public spirits and was hailed a national hero. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July.

Moore's funeral, which he played a significant role in planning, was held at the Bedford Crematorium near his home.

In keeping with Britain's Covid-19 restrictions, just eight members of his immediate family attended the funeral, his two daughters Hannah Ingram-Moore and Lucy Teixeira, four grandchildren and his sons-in-law — all wearing face masks.

Draped in a union flag, his coffin was carried by soldiers while a World War II-era C-47 Dakota plane performed an honorary fly-past.

Reflecting his humor, Moore's epitaph will read: ""I told you I was old,"" a reference to British comedian Spike Milligan's famous epitaph: ""I told you I was ill."" Moore was a big fan, his family said.

They have also supported a global initiative to plant millions of trees, so that his legacy can live on.

Raised in the U.K.'s northern county of Yorkshire, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during the war.

After his garden walking exploits drew praise, he went on to record a number one pop song and author a book.

""The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of,"" his daughters said following his death.

The Federal Government plans to spend A$498 million (S$520 million) on an extension of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra that will expand its exhibition space and allow it to display larger objects such as a fighter helicopter and a reconnaissance plane.

But the move has been condemned by historians and some former military officers, who say it is unnecessary and will change the purpose of the museum from a memorial to a ""Disneyland""-type presentation of war.

The project was announced in 2018 by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said the overhaul would allow the memorial to improve its displays, particularly of deployments in the past two decades to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands and East Timor.

Mr Morrison has repeatedly defended the revamp, describing it last year as a ""tremendous project"" that would honour veterans, particularly those who served in recent conflicts.

""We do need to tell all the stories of Australia's service,"" he said. ""And there needs to be room and space and appropriate facilities there to recognise and reflect that.""

The overhaul is being considered by Parliament's public works committee. According to a report last Saturday (Feb 20) in The Australian Financial Review, the committee is expected this week to confirm it is approving the cost of the project.

However, some MPs in the committee are expected to write a dissenting report, as the project has proven controversial and raised questions about the proper aims of a national war memorial.

An expert on Australian history at the University of Sydney, Professor Mark McKenna, said the Government appeared to be elevating Australia's military history above other features of its past.

""While other major institutions, such as the National Library, National Museum, National Gallery and National Archives, have seen funding cuts, job losses and the reduction of services, the Australian War Memorial behemoth swells to hitherto unimaginable proportions,"" he wrote in The Monthly magazine this month.

A former chief of the Australian Defence Force, Admiral Chris Barrie, told The Sydney Morning Herald last year that new Australian memorials and commemorations were ""not helping (veterans') families, it's not helping to repair the damage we've done"".

Since Australia became a nation in 1901, it has deployed troops to dozens of conflicts, including World Wars I and II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. About 102,000 Australians have died while on active service.

Critics of the war memorial's overhaul have expressed concern about the enormous cost, arguing that the memorial already successfully and respectfully chronicles Australia's war history for the general public. The memorial opened in Canberra 80 years ago - in the midst of World War II - and includes a museum, a shrine to the fallen, and an extensive archive. It is one of the leading destinations for tourists who visit the national capital. In 2018 to 2019, its last full year of visits before the pandemic, the memorial had 881,380 visitors, including 136,799 school students.

A former director of the memorial, Mr Brendon Kelson, has warned that the revamp risked turning the memorial into a ""theme park"" that would appeal to enthusiasts of military hardware. He said the museum should be a ""poignant tribute"" to Australians who died at war, rather than a military museum."

Counting the dead is one of the first, somber steps in reckoning with an event of enormous tragic scope, be that war, natural disaster or a pandemic.

This dark but necessary arithmetic has become all too routine during the COVID-19 outbreak.

January was the deadliest month so far in the U.S.; the virus killed more than 95,458 Americans.

The total U.S death toll has now surpassed 441,000.

Each death is unique, a devastating loss that ripples through a family, a network, a community. But in the aggregate, the national death toll can feel abstract, and its constant repetition in the news can become numbing. Journalists, commentators and public officials are left searching for new ways to convey the deadliness of this pathogen, and the significance of its mounting fatality rate.

Many have turned to history, citing Pearl Harbor (2,403 killed) or the 9/11 attacks (at least 2,977 killed), as a way of providing perspective when the number of daily COVID deaths in the U.S. reached those levels. (Currently, more than 3,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day.)

Jan. 21, 2021 offered another opportunity for historical comparison: That was the day when the COVID death toll in the U.S. reached — and then exceeded — the 405,399 Americans who died in World War II.

For many, attempting to compare the two death tolls — or even take note of their brief conjunction — is misguided or even offensive. It is certainly a morally fraught exercise. The true emotional and social impact of either event can never be quantified, but many media outlets still mentioned it.

Which raises the question: Are we as a society too quick to reach for these historical comparisons? Should a politically driven world war and a biologically driven pandemic, more than seven decades apart, be put side by side at all?

""This is comparing apples to oranges,"" wrote NPR listener Kris Petron in December, in response to a story that made use of that comparison. ""It is extremely disrespectful to our nation's veterans, who write a blank check with their lives, to defend our Constitution.""

Petron is not alone.

This type of response, over time, has convinced medical historian Dr. Howard Markel to make it a practice of never drawing parallels between the death toll from war and a pandemic.

""I try not to make comparisons to an event or group that I know contains within it a great deal of sentiment, feeling and pain,"" says Markel, a professor at the University of Michigan and author of When Germs Travel: Six Major Epidemics That Have Invaded America and the Fears They Have Unleashed.

The notion that combat deaths carry a unique meaning or value is deeply rooted in human culture. Societies tend to valorize those who died for a cause on a battlefield.

But in this pandemic it's the frail elderly — many of them living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities — who have died in vast numbers.

""To the watching world, that's not the same as the death of a young soldier in their 20s, let's say, on the front lines in a war,"" says Yale historian Frank Snowden, author of Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.

""But, I don't think we have a right to weigh up lives and say which is more important,"" Snowden added.

Unlike COVID-19, the global influenza pandemic of 1918-19 killed many people who were in their 20s and 30s — yet as Snowden notes, there wasn't much collective mourning for those young adults, despite dying in the prime of life.

""People were so used to mortality because of the [first world] war that even the horrible tallies that were coming with the Spanish influenza had lost their capacity to horrify the way that one might expect,"" he says.

When we do compare death tolls, what exactly are we comparing?

The effort to compare the death toll of the pandemic with that of a war strikes historian Sam Biagetti as an especially ""modern"" exercise.

""Through the vast majority of human history, people have understood warfare and disease to go hand in hand and to be inextricably linked,"" says Biagetti, who is the creator and host of the podcast Historiansplaining.

The flu pandemic 100 years ago was fueled by the conditions of World War I and ultimately killed more people than the war, with an estimated 50 million flu deaths worldwide and upwards of 700,000 flu deaths in the U.S.

""All those millions of deaths were another outcome of the war, and people didn't understand them necessarily as two separate phenomena,"" he says.

In fact, before World War II, combatants were far more likely to die of an infectious disease than from battle-related trauma. Biagetti points out that World War II was the first conflict in American history in which combat killed more fighters than disease, a pattern which has continued since and reflects medical advances such as vaccines and antibiotics.

""We've really changed how we think about war, in a way that is misleading and distorting — this idea you can kind of sum up the toll of a war just by counting the bodies from the battlefield,"" Biagetti says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Hulton Archive/Getty Images Hulton Archive/Getty Images

Official military records are one way of assessing a conflict's lethality, but they have limits, which is why Biagetti views them as inadequate for understanding the full breadth of the impact of these historical events.

The carnage of war doesn't end just because peace is declared. The chaos and turmoil often fuels further death, as the influenza pandemic did in World War I. The spillover effects of war continue long after formal hostilities end, and include disability and disfigurement, mental trauma, addiction, homelessness and suicide.

One example is the ongoing suicide crisis among U.S. veterans. Between 2005 and 2017, 78,875 veterans died by suicide — more than the number of soldiers killed in Vietnam, 58,220.

For all these reasons, Biagetti worries about comparing the current pandemic to any war, even if just for the purpose of counting the dead.

""You can't just try to sum up in a simple statistic, how big is this disaster versus that disaster, as if they can even be summed up in a simple number at all.""

And yet the language of warfare permeates so much of the national discourse about the pandemic.

Nurses work on the ""frontlines."" Coronavirus is described as an invisible ""enemy."" The country is ""battling"" the virus.

As a metaphor, ""war"" becomes a call to action, and a recognition of sacrifice

On Jan. 15, then-President-elect Joe Biden announced his vaccine distribution plan, declaring: ""We're in a war with this virus.""

Five days later, in his inaugural address, he said: ""It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.""

Some Americans whose relatives have died from COVID embrace the rhetoric of war, and believe comparing the pandemic to past wars is imperative.

""The scale of this is that of a war, it's just a different type of war and it's not one that we're necessarily taught in our history books,"" says Kristen Urquiza, who co-founded the advocacy group Marked By COVID after her father died from the disease over the summer.

Urquiza believes that the country struggled collectively to respond to the coronavirus because Americans have little understanding about what it takes to overcome a pandemic.

""In a way, it's sort of more dangerous [than war] because we are culturally unprepared for it.""

There are also veterans who feel the war analogies are appropriate, and even helpful. Dr. Cleavon Gilman, an emergency physician in Yuma, Ariz., has treated COVID-19 patients from the early days of the outbreak and readily compares the pandemic to a war.

""It's very hard to communicate the severity of this pandemic if you're not in a hospital, where this war is being waged,"" says Gilman, who served as a Marine combat medic in Iraq in 2004.

World War II was the deadliest war in human history, but not in American history: that distinction belongs to the Civil War. The death toll has traditionally been estimated to be about 618,000 but new research indicates 750,000 may be more accurate.

But World War II looms large in America's cultural memory as a ""good war,"" one that united the country against a clear-cut enemy, says Catherine Mas, a history professor at Florida International University who studies the history of medicine, race and religion.

In retrospect, the American response to World War II stands in sharp contrast to the current political divisions over the coronavirus, and the fragmented and uneven national response.

Despite the differences, Mas says the comparisons can still be powerful tools as the country tries to reckon with a crisis that has taken place out of sight for many Americans. People are dying in hospitals, without family members at the bedside, and only healthcare workers are there to bear witness.

""The reason we want to compare COVID-19 deaths to something like World War II is not just because the numbers are there, but to acknowledge this is a significant rupture in society,"" she says.

""This mass death is going to create trauma: how are we going to deal with that? How have we dealt with that in the past? I think it's part of our human condition to try to search for some reference points.""

The prosecutor said the Neuruppin office was given the case in 2019 by the special federal prosecutors’ office in Ludwigsburg charged with investigating Nazi-era war crimes.

The Zombies mode in many ways feels like the thinnest of the game's three modes, but it's thrilling to play with friends. And now it's getting even more fleshed-out (pun intended) in the game's post-launch support. Still, a new map means that you'll have to learn where everything important is all over again.

One of the most helpful upgrades to look for within the Firebase Z map is the Pack-a-Punch , which is used to make powerful upgrades to your weapons. Here's where to find the Pack-a-Punch on Firebase Z and how to turn it on ASAP so you can increase your chances of surviving wave after wave of zombies.

The Pack-A-Punch is an extremely useful tool that will help players survive in the long-term in any endless Zombies match. Once unlocked, players can upgrade their weapon up to three times with it to increase their weapon's damage, magazine size, and more.

In Black Ops Cold War, the first tier costs 5,000 Essence ; the second tier costs 15,000 ; and the final tier costs 30,000 . You can also apply ammo mods through it for 2,000 Essence .

Players gain Essence by killing zombies, and you probably won't have enough to buy all three tiers until very late until the match. Still, powering weapons up is a vital part of surviving, so it's vital to know where to find the upgrade machine and how to turn it on

The Pack-a-Punch in Black Ops Cold War's Firebase Z map is pretty hard to miss, even if you can't use it right away. One of the first objectives on Firebase Z is to talk to Captain Ravenov , who is fortified in an office on the map. He's located left of players' starting positions with a large objective marker.

When you go to meet Captain Ravenov, you should see the Pack-A-Punch right next to Ravenov's office .

Here, the location is clearly visible on the in-game mini-map. Activision

While it's technically in the first area of Firebase Z, you can't unlock it right away. Interacting with it will show a message: ""You need to turn the power on first.""

How to turn on the power in Call of Duty: Cold War's Firebase Z

After your conversation with Captain Ravenov, you'll need to progress through Firebase Z's story to turn on the power for the Pack-a-Punch. Go through the teleporter marked on your map. Once you do this, you'll be brought to a new area and asked to power up 3 Aether reactors . You can then go to one of them and start powering it up for 500 points.

You'll then have to protect the reactor's collection units from a wave of zombies. If your team survives, the reactor will be powered up. Repeat this process with the other two Aether reactions on the map and all of Firebase Z will receive power. After this, you can return to the Pack-a-Punch and upgrade your weapons.

The patch has added a small speed penalty and jump height penalty after landing from a jump, Treyarch said.

Jump-shotting - one of the more advanced tactics of Call of Duty competitive multiplayer - is done by players to make them harder to shoot, or to make it more likely they will be shot below the head and thus take less damage, while also shooting themselves. You tend to see players jump-shot around corners when they suspect an enemy is waiting for them.

Eurogamer Next-Gen News Cast - Will PlayStation Studios publish more games on Xbox?

Jump-shotting has always been the subject of debate within the Call of Duty community, with some saying it has no place in the series, and others saying it benefits the skill gap.

Treyarch made the change to Black Ops Cold War's movement on 4th February alongside its big mid-season update without revealing the tweak in the patch notes. It didn't take long for players to pick up on it, though, and then last night the developer confirmed the change in follow-up patch notes.

The patch has added a small speed penalty and jump height penalty after landing from a jump, Treyarch said. Pre-patch, after a jump-shot you'd be able to continue your movement, getting back up to speed quickly enough to continue strafing while aiming down sights, or even go for another jump / slide combo (bunny-hopping).

Post-patch, once your feet hit the ground, you're locked into place for a short amount of time, preventing you from continuing to strafe while aiming down sights for that short period.

It's a subtle change, but it does amount to a significant nerf to jump-shotting, and certainly makes it a more risky tactic. The video below from Call of Duty YouTuber explains how it all works:

Treyarch said it will monitor this change to see how it goes, and will make further changes as needed.

Cold War Firebase Z Truth Serum

Cold War Firebase Z has the main story that leads the player to the Firebase Z easter egg. While trying to get to the Firebase Z Easter Egg, the players will have to go through a series of tasks. One of these tasks includes creating a Truth Serum. Here’s how the players can complete the Firebase Z Truth Serum Task:

After using the Pack-a-Punch machine and talking to Ravenov, players will hear Peck’s voice asking them to come and meet him.

Peck is located under a set of shutters, below one of the Collection Units inside the Mission Control of Firebase Z.

Peck will let the players know that Samantha is in the Dark Aether.

After that, the players will have to go back to Ravenov to get their ID.

Players will have to use Ravenov’s ID to access 3 lockers that will contain the Truth Serum Ingredients

These Lockers will take the player to the Firebase Z Serum Locations

The first ingredient can be found in the engineering section of Firebase Z

The second ingredient can be found around the teleporter

The third and final ingredient can be found at the Colonel’s Office.

After all the ingredients have been collected from the Firebase Z Serum Locations that players should head to the Field Hospital to create the Serum

Then the players will have to transfer the Truth Serum into a Gas Dispersal Unit

Head Back to Peck and attach the Gas Dispersal Unit to the room’s air vent.

This will spread the serum in the room and make Peck a little more talkative than he was before

Players can now get more information out of Peck and get the clue for their next step to finding the Firebase Z Easter Egg.

Following yesterday’s mysterious teaser image of Boba Fett, StarWars.com is excited to announce War of the Bounty Hunters, an epic crossover in the Merry Marvel tradition that will indeed reveal what Fett experienced on his journey to deliver Solo.
The five-issue War of the Bounty Hunters miniseries from Soule and Luke Ross, which will anchor the story, begins in June.
“The main story that we’re dealing with is a Boba Fett-focused crime epic, that involves Boba Fett going up against some of the heaviest hitters in the galaxy.
“It’s basically Boba Fett, by himself, against all of these people.”And what could make Boba Fett take on the galaxy’s worst?","war, tell, star, exclusive, marvels, worst, hunters, bounty, soule, galaxys, epic, boba, vader, fett, wars",war,Military Conflicts,"





Back in 2019, writer Charles Soule created a big pitch document for Marvel’s flagship Star Wars series. It outlined his plans for the title, but also included was one specific story he was itching to write.

“Boba Fett clearly doesn’t take Han Solo directly to Jabba’s palace,” Soule tells StarWars.com. “Something had to happen in between that intervening time between Empire and Jedi. And I was like, ‘I would like to tell that story, and I would like it to be about Boba Fett and what happens to him.”

Finally, Soule will get his chance. Following yesterday’s mysterious teaser image of Boba Fett, StarWars.com is excited to announce War of the Bounty Hunters, an epic crossover in the Merry Marvel tradition that will indeed reveal what Fett experienced on his journey to deliver Solo. Running from May through October, it all kicks off with War of the Bounty Hunters Alpha #1 from Soule and artist Steve McNiven (“I think it’s the best work he’s maybe ever done,” Soule says; you can get a first look at the cover and interior art below) on May 5, and will then spin out into Marvel’s entire post-Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back line, including Star Wars, Bounty Hunters, Darth Vader, and Doctor Aphra. The five-issue War of the Bounty Hunters miniseries from Soule and Luke Ross, which will anchor the story, begins in June. From the sound of it, it wasn’t exactly smooth space sailing from Cloud City to Tatooine.

“The main story that we’re dealing with is a Boba Fett-focused crime epic, that involves Boba Fett going up against some of the heaviest hitters in the galaxy. It’s Jabba the Hutt. It’s Black Sun. It’s Darth Vader. And a bunch of others — factions and so on — that I think will be really interesting for the fans,” says Soule. “It’s basically Boba Fett, by himself, against all of these people.”

And what could make Boba Fett take on the galaxy’s worst? There could be only one thing.

“Boba Fett is in possession of Han Solo at the end of Empire Strikes Back, and at the beginning of War of the Bounty Hunters, he is not,” says Soule. “And he is going to do everything he can to get him back, no matter what. No matter who is standing in his way.”

While the inspiration for the story comes from Soule, he’s quick to point out that the overall event is a true collaboration between himself and several of Marvel’s Star Wars creators, including writers Greg Pak (Darth Vader), Alyssa Wong (Doctor Aphra), and Ethan Sacks (Bounty Hunters). “My co-writers on this story, and all of the great artists that we’re working with, it’s a fantastic team. This might’ve come from my brain to a degree, but we’re all adding things to it, and we’re all adding really interesting things to it,” he says. “Everybody’s getting to tell their own story within this over-arching plot of Boba Fett trying to get what’s his.”

War of the Bounty Hunters will be the biggest Star Wars story Marvel has told thus far. And while he can’t say much, Soule promises it will have an impact.

“War of the Bounty Hunters is a story about Boba Fett doing his thing, but it builds into something much bigger, and that’s what the best comic crossovers and big stories do. They tell a great story in and of themselves, but they’re also the start of something, and they open a lot of new doors. And this story will absolutely do that.”

National Book Award-winning author Tim O'Brien is best known for his stories about the Vietnam War, including the 1990 novel, The Things They Carried. But he says he'd give up every book he's written if it meant more time on earth with his two young sons.

Now 74, O'Brien didn't become a father until his late 50s. He says he was initially worried that having children would curtail his ability to write.

""I always identified myself as a writer even from the time I was a little boy,"" he says. ""That's what I wanted to be and do and that's what I valued — making graceful sentences. And I thought that with a child in the house — and then two children in the house — that would end.""

Having children made him want to step away from writing, which he did for many years. But eventually O'Brien started up again — this time focusing on fatherhood. His 2019 book, Dad's Maybe Book, was his first since his sons were born.

""Much as Vietnam did, [parenthood] gave me a body of material, that kind of context to write about,"" he says. ""Maybe it's biology just keeping the species going, but I feel that I'm part of something age-old that's going to continue long after I'm gone.""

O'Brien reflects on writing, mortality and his experiences in Vietnam in the new documentary, The War and Peace of Tim O'Brien.

Interview highlights

On speaking openly about mortality with his sons

I talk to them pretty bluntly when they say, ""Dad, you're old, you're going to die."" I said, ""I know. Sad."" I don't say, ""No,"" and I don't deny it, because it's a lie and I don't want to leave them with a lie. The reality is the reality, and they've adjusted to it over time. The crying is stopped, especially my older boy Timmy would really weep about it. He'd come out in the middle of the night and wake me up and say ... ""You're going to die, Dad, and I can't stand it."" And we would talk about my age and what a great gift it had been to spend time with them already. Now, when my older boy is 17 and my younger, Tad, is 15, they still think about it. I still think about it. My wife still thinks about it. But it's not in a macabre kind of way. It's not grim. It's growing comfortable with reality. And we have a happy house, I think, partly because we don't deny reality.

On how his own childhood experiences made him reluctant to become a father

I had a tough childhood. My dad was an alcoholic and sometimes he wasn't physically present, but he also was not emotionally present much of the time. He was a great man in many ways — he was funny, he was fun to be around when he was sober, but when he was not, life was hard. ... And I feared that I may have inherited whatever chromosome caused that, and I did not want to be a bad father. That was a huge, huge part of it.

On how his father, who wanted to be a writer, felt about his son's books

Jealousy was one component of his attitude toward it. I think he was also proud in a sense. ... Humans are such complicated people. He never expressed himself on the issue one way or the other verbally to me. He never said he liked my books. He never discussed with me the content of the books, the events that happened in the books. I don't know why. I'm not completely sure he ever read them all the way through. Maybe he did. Maybe not. It's a mystery to me, as so much of my life is a mystery to me.

On not feeling traumatized by the war

I'll sometimes look at my hands and think, 'God, these hands were in a war. You're not a violent guy and you couldn't have pulled the trigger.' And I know I did. And I know I was violent, that I shot at people and it just doesn't feel real.

I don't dream about it a lot. I certainly, in my waking life, don't think about it a lot. And the reason is ... for my whole life, it felt like it wasn't real, even in Vietnam. ""This can't be happening. This can't be happening. You're not a soldier."" There's this constant sense that the war didn't feel real to me, even as it was happening, and that's been compounded now that it's over. I'll sometimes look at my hands and think, ""God, these hands were in a war. You're not a violent guy and you couldn't have pulled the trigger."" And I know I did. And I know I was violent, that I shot at people and it just doesn't feel real.

On his nickname ""College Joe"" during the war, and the burden of fighting in it

I hated Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts. I didn't like bugs and sleeping in the rain and none of that. And I didn't know anything about weapons. And a lot of the guys I served with were outdoor types, and they did like and know that stuff. So I think the ""College Joe"" thing was maybe not derogatory, but it meant that I wasn't cut out to be a soldier — and I wasn't. I did the one thing I could do, which was ... I just kept my legs moving. I didn't fall to the ground. I didn't quit. I didn't say, ""Take me to some insane asylum and lock me away."" I did keep going. And I look back on that as the only kind of source of pride out of it. Somehow I endured it all. That's something.

And the problem for me really is that I questioned the rectitude of the war, period. I thought I was doing the wrong thing by being there. And it ate at me constantly, where most of the men around me thought we should invade North Vietnam and put a big Iron Curtain around Hanoi and then bomb the hell out of it. ... It's been a source of continuing guilt and shame that I actually went to that thing and participated in it. If there's a single burden that I have to carry through my life, that's the heaviest. It's that sense of: I shouldn't have done it.

On the title The Things They Carried

The word ""they"" is meant to encompass not just soldiers, but the mothers of soldiers, the fathers, but to go even beyond that to things you carry as a broadcaster and an interviewer to worries you carry. Did I do a good enough job? Did I ask the right questions? Did I elicit what I was after? You know how you take those things home with you? ... We all carry physical stuff that represents who we are. But we also carry the emotional aftershocks of our lives — the joys and the sadness and everything else.

On visiting the Vietnam War memorial in Washington, D.C.

It was a tearful experience. I broke down and wept. I found the names of people that died in my presence and put my fingers on their names and leaned against that wall. It makes me cry now, just remembering that moment, I was near dusk, almost dark, and the shadows of the wall were shadows of the war over me and my friends. It was an emotional time, and it's a beautiful elegiac monument to human suffering.

To help keep things fair in the ranked mode, Treyarch has released a list of gear that will be disabled for all players in League Play.

The list of disabled attachments and Scorestreaks are designed to help keep some of Black Ops Cold War’s least balanced items out of its most competitive game mode. Things like suppressors are disabled, as well as certain barrels for weapons like the RPK LMG, which make some guns a little too powerful. Also on the restricted list are the armor and War Machine Scorestreaks, which could too quickly tilt the game in favor of the team that got them.

This patch also offers players a few new fixes for Firebase Z, Black Ops Cold War’s latest Zombies map. The patch should fix a variety of crashes related to Essence Traps, the map’s main quest, and the Tombstone Soda perk, as well as a few other bugs. Players should also receive proper credit toward their challenges when they kill Elite zombies.

While it wasn’t part of the Black Ops Cold War patch, Raven Software, the development team behind Call of Duty: Warzone’s security and updates, let players know that it has issued a second wave of bans. The Call of Duty battle royale game continues to struggle with a deluge of cheaters, despite Raven’s ban of over 60,000 players last week. The studio said in a tweet that it will have more information on further efforts to curb Warzone’s cheating problem in the near future.

Fans of the old-school tabletop game will be excited to hear that developers will be returning to the classic Old World setting — much like the tabletop game itself, after a five-year dalliance with the Age of Sigmar.

Total War: Warhammer is an elaborate turn-based strategy series shot through with intimate, real-time battles. It builds on Creative Assembly’s own style of pausable real-time combat, which dates back more than 20 years to the release of Shogun: Total War. And the series draws upon the rich history of Games Workshop’s wildly popular tabletop miniatures game, first released in 1983.

The first entry in the series, Total War: Warhammer, was released in 2016. The sequel, Total War: Warhammer 2, was released just one year later. The two games combined both narratively and literally to tell a sprawling tale from multiple perspectives across a massive world map. Developers say that this time around players will be fighting on truly unfamiliar territory — the nightmarish Chaos Realm.

In the lore of Warhammer, the Realm of Chaos — also known as The Aethyr — is a dimension of pure magic. The cinematic trailer shows Kislev warriors, a fictional human faction that draws from Polish and Russian military history, fighting against the demonic forces of Khorne. The battlefield itself is an impassable frozen landscape with tooth-like mountains rising in the distance. The imagery recalls some of the more fantastical battlescapes from previous entries in the series, which included massive underground caverns and other unearthly environments.

Today’s press release confirms both the Kislev and Cathay armies as playable factions alongside the agents of Chaos — Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh, and Tzeentch. Fans of the Warhammer 40,000 setting will recognize those gods, which are shared between both gameplay systems. Today’s news release also hints at “iconic new races from the World of Warhammer Fantasy Battles system.” Expect more information on those factions to trickle out, along with details on a release window, over the next several months."

The ruling in January by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), created under the 2016 peace deal between the government and the rebels, was the first time the JEP attributed criminal responsibility for hostage-taking to former leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

The former commanders were also accused of other war crimes connected with the treatment of kidnap victims, including murder and torture, among others.

“We recognize that during (the conflict) actions and conduct punishable in the eyes of international humanitarian law took place. Actions and conducts that have been individually and collectively recognized by the JEP, society in general, and in activities with victims,” a statement signed by six of the former rebel commanders and published on Twitter said.

The FARC used kidnappings for ransom to fund their war, while captured military or government personnel were used to pressure authorities into releasing jailed rebels, the JEP said last month.

By accepting the accusations, the former commanders could face restrictions on their freedoms for five to eight years.

If they had rejected them, the commanders would have faced up to 20 years in prison, per the terms of the peace deal.

The signatories were former top leader Rodrigo Londono - known best by his nom de guerre Timochenko - Jaime Alberto Parra, Pablo Catatumbo, Pastor Alape, Julian Gallo and Rodrigo Grande.

Approximately 11 million people need humanitarian assistance, about 6 million are internally displaced and 5.5 million Syrian refugees live in neighbouring countries according to the UNHCR.

Shifting alliances and rapid changes since 2011 have made for a complex conflict that is still raging, particularly in the northwest.

Here we break down how the war unfolded, how territorial control has changed, and who the different players are.

How it started

On March 15, 2011, major unrest erupted across the streets of Deraa, Damascus and Aleppo, with protesters demanding democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners.

Protests were triggered by the arrest and torture of a group of teenaged boys a few days earlier in the city of Deraa over graffiti denouncing longtime president Bashar al-Assad.

A violent crackdown and repression by the government followed. In July 2011, defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group aiming to overthrow the government, turning the revolt into a civil war.

Protests continued into 2012, and by 2013 various rebels groups emerged across the country. Later that year, ISIL (ISIS) emerged in northern and eastern Syria after overrunning large portions of Iraq.

Groups involved

A variety of actors are locked in a power struggle in Syria.

The Syrian government

Bashar al-Assad inherited his rule of Syria in 2000, taking over from his father Hafez al-Assad, who had been in power since 1970.

He has ruled the country with an iron fist and has a history of crackdowns on dissidents, using chemical weapons against his people and imprisoning and torturing thousands.

Free Syrian Army (FSA)/Syrian National Army

the FSA is a loose conglomeration of armed brigades formed in 2011 by defectors from the Syrian army and civilians backed by Turkey and several Gulf countries.

Since the Battle of Aleppo in December 2016, the FSA has remained in control of limited areas of Idlib in northwestern Syria.

Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)

HTS was formerly Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra.

Jabhat al-Nusra formed in Syria in 2011 as an al-Qaeda affiliate within the opposition to the Assad government.

By January 2017, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham rebranded when it merged with several other groups to unite under the banner of Hay’et Tahrir-al Sham.

Currently, HTS maintains that it is “an independent entity that follows no organisation or party”.

Hezbollah

Hezbollah is a Shia armed group and a political force based out of Lebanon, backed by Iran. They moved into Syria to support al-Assad’s forces and they currently control no territory in Syria.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)

This alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias was founded in 2015.

Its makeup largely consists of YPG fighters and smaller groups of Arab, Turkmen and Armenian fighters.

Turkey considers the YPG, which forms the bulk of the SDF forces, an extension of PKK, which has waged an armed campaign for independence against the Turkish government that has killed more than 40,000 people since 1984.

Main cities under Kurdish control are Raqqa, Qamishli, Hasakah.

ISIL (ISIS)

Predominantly known for the brutality of its foreign fighters, organised government systems, and strong social media presence, ISIL rose to power in the vacuum in Syria after 2012 as civil unrest grew. By 2014, it had captured significant land by force and declared the creation of a “caliphate”.

ISIL’s “caliphate” was destroyed in March 2019 but their reemergence looms in the region. In 2014, in its peak of power, it controlled roughly one-third of Iraq and Syria.

The damages of war

Aleppo

Aleppo was an industrial and economic hub in northwest Syria with nearly 3 million inhabitants at its peak.

In December 2016, the Syrian army scored its biggest victory against the rebels when it recaptured the strategic city. The city had been divided and under rebel control since the beginning of the unrest in 2012.

Eastern Ghouta

Eastern Ghouta lies 10km (six miles) east of the capital, Damascus.

In 2018, after a fierce seven-week offensive that left much of the city in ruins, the Syrian army regained control of areas that had been held by opposition fighters since 2012.

Raqqa

Raqqa, situated on the Euphrates River in Syria’s north, was the first governorate capital to fall under opposition control after the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. In 2014, the city was captured by ISIL (ISIS), who declared it their capital.

Raqqa and many villages and towns in the province were devastated by US-led coalition air raids during the anti-ISIL operation between 2016 and 2017. According to some estimates, between 70 and 80 percent of the city was destroyed, and its infrastructure almost completely wiped out.

Palmyra

A UNESCO World Heritage site in central Syria, Palmyra was captured twice by ISIL – first in May 2015 and then again in December the following year.

The group destroyed several ancient wonders including the Temple of Bel, the Temple of Baal Shamin, the Arch of Triumph, and columns in the Valley of the Tombs.

In March 2017, the Syrian army, backed by allied forces and Russian warplanes, recaptured the city.

Deir az Zor

In 2014, ISIL captured Deir az Zor, an oil-rich governorate located in the east of the country bordering Iraq. The main city was taken by Syrian government forces with help from the SDF in November 2017. It was ISIL’s last urban stronghold in the war-torn country.

Idlib

The province of Idlib on Syria’s western border with Turkey is currently home to more than three million people, the majority of whom are internally displaced. The FSA has controlled the area since the beginning of the civil unrest.

Slowly, rebel forces have lost control to Assad’s forces. Since December 2019, the Syrian government has renewed its military operations to take over the last opposition stronghold, shelling Idlib’s countryside with the backing of Russian air raids.

The human cost of war

With colossal damage to homes, schools, hospitals and infrastructure, large parts of Syria have been shattered by the fighting. US government sanctions and a surge of COVID infections has made life even more difficult for war-weary families.

There is limited shelter, fuel is scarce, and food prices are soaring.

According to the UN, Syria is “the worst man-made disaster since World War II”.

9.3 million Syrians are food-insecure, and approximately 4.5 million children are going hungry in the country.

Syrians make up one-third of all the refugees around the world. According to the UNHCR, 80 percent of Syrian refugees live below the poverty line, with limited access to basic services, education or job opportunities.

At least 5.5 million refugees are living in neighbouring countries Iraq, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt – and within Syria, 6 million people are internally displaced."

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may be accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but he has managed to save his regime at the cost of Syria’s destruction, thanks to his Russian and Iranian allies. However after 10 years of war, is he really the master of Syria?

In the spring of 2011, the discourse on Middle East desks in Western capitals was dominated by speculations on how long Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would last in power. The prevailing view was that it would be a matter of weeks, months perhaps, before the strongman of Syria was ousted, like his Tunisian and Egyptian counterparts, by protests sweeping the Arab world.

But a decade after the first demonstrations against his regime broke out, Assad is still in power in a country in physical ruins, economically on its knees and with a populace traumatised by an endless conflict. The Syrian war has cost several hundreds of thousand lives, displaced millions and plunged more than 80 percent of the population into poverty, according to the UN.

Saved by the interventions of his Russian and Iranian allies – with whom he must now deal with in his own country – the Syrian president has regained military control of large parts of Syria, even if violent clashes and the presence of jihadists are still a reality in certain areas.

Assad may be accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but there appears to be nothing to prevent the 55-year-old leader, who inherited the presidency following his father’s death in 2000, from winning yet another presidential election, this one scheduled for the summer.

A president indebted to the Russians and Iranians

""He’s still in power and we do not see what are the alternatives that could be opposed to him, especially from the West’s point of view. As for his Russian and Iranian allies, they have no reason to replace him. So yes, he won his bet to save his regime,"" explained Fabrice Balanche, a Syria expert at the University of Lyon 2, in an interview with FRANCE 24.

""Unlike [Tunisia’s] Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, [Egypt’s] Hosni Mubarak or [Libya’s] Colonel Gaddafi, who were all swept away by the Arab revolts, Bashar al-Assad has remained in power by making his population pay a high price. We can say he’s under the tutelage of his Russian and Iranian protectors, but the fact remains that he is indeed the Syrian president, it’s not Vladimir Putin, it’s Bashar al-Assad,"" noted Antoine Mariotti, FRANCE 24’s Middle East correspondent and author of the book, ""La Honte de l'Occident: Les Coulisses du fiasco syrien"" [The Shame of the West: Behind the Scenes of the Syrian Fiasco], which was published in France last week.

But Ziad Majed – a professor at the American University of Paris and a co-author of “Dans la tête de Bachar al-Assad"" [""In the head of Bashar al-Assad""] – believes that Assad is no longer master of his destiny, nor of the Syrian conflict and its resolution.

""Even if the departure of the Syrian president is no longer demanded by any foreign actor in the conflict, and this issue is no longer a priority since the Russian intervention has secured the regime, Moscow and Tehran have made it clear to Bashar al-Assad that they are his only hope of staying in power,” explained Majed. “And this reality could weaken him if ever – and this is far from being the case today – serious negotiations were to begin to find a solution with a political transition.”

A ‘pillar’ with limited sovereignty

The Syrian president though appears to be satisfied with his limited sovereignty over his own country. “He knows how much he owes the Russians and the Iranians,"" said Mariotti. “Without their political, diplomatic and especially military support, it’s not certain that he would still be in power today.”

Assad has no choice but to accept the current situation because he needs his allies to protect him on the international stage as well as domestically, to complete the reconquest of Syria. “In the East, they know how to be extremely patient, and Bashar al-Assad is playing it safe in order to remain indispensable in their eyes,"" explained Mariotti. “Finally, what Moscow and Tehran want is the stability of the country, and as long as he is able to ensure this, the current configuration will remain unchanged, because he is the pillar on which everything rests.”

Syrian youth still paying high price for decade of war 01:39

While Syrian territory is under the influence of several foreign actors in the conflict such as Russia, Iran and Turkey, which directly or through their allies control parts of the country, Assad's real power appears to have weakened.

""To understand who controls what in Syria,"" Balanche explained, it’s critical to look at control of the borders, because they are a marker of sovereignty and a projection of regional power. “Today, the Syrian army directly controls only 15 percent of the country's borders, basically the stretch that separates Syria from Jordan and a small part of the border in northern Lebanon.""

“This is extremely revealing of the reality of Bashar al-Assad's power, because if he were strong and had a choice, he would not let the Lebanese Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Shiite militias and Russia control the rest of the borders, instead of the Syrian army,” said Balanche. ""Even when it comes to the airspace, Damascus does not control anything since Israeli planes can bomb targets in Syria at any time, and normally the Syrian sky is supposed to be protected by Russia.”

For Majed, ""the regime no longer has a say in a country fragmented and occupied by foreign forces because it no longer manages anything except its prison system and internal politics in the areas it controls. This is all that’s left of the sovereignty of the Syrian state since it is neither master of its defence, nor of its diplomacy, which is modelled on those of its Russian and Iranian protectors”.

Russia treats Syria the way Syria treated Lebanon

Majed, a Franco-Lebanese political scientist, compares the reality of Assad's power today to that of Lebanese authorities during the 1976-2005 Syrian occupation of neighbouring Lebanon.

""Ironically, he is treated by the Russians in the same way that they treated and humiliated Lebanese puppet presidents and politicians during the occupation, since he is at the mercy of Vladimir Putin, who can slap him on the wrist or summon him to Moscow whenever he wants,"" said Majed. The Russians, like the Iranians, prefer to have a weakened leader under their control in order to make him even more dependent on their support, he noted.

>> Syria’s impotent opposition consistently fails to provide any threat to Assad

Balanche agrees that the situation can be compared with that of occupied Lebanon ""in the sense that Syria has become an Iranian-Russian protectorate, and that Moscow is in a position to impose its will on the Syrian president, who is its servant”. But Balanche also notes that when Putin summons the Syrian leader to Moscow, “he does not seek to humiliate Bashar al-Assad, while the Lebanese leaders were more ostensibly mandated to Damascus”.

In this asymmetrical relationship, he continues, the Syrian president is not really in a position to say no to the Russians and is sometimes forced to make concessions. ""However, he still retains a certain nuisance power to stand up to Moscow, reminding them, for example, that he remains indispensable for delivering information gathered by his intelligence services, which are crucial for the security of Russian troops in Syria,” Balanche explained.

Assad ""knows that the Iranians and the Russians are obliged to put up with him, since he himself has prevented the emergence of any potential competitor, and he uses this to balance his relations with his two protectors to hang on for a while,"" said Mariotti. ""No one within the regime can stand up against him and he will succeed himself in the presidential election, and the Russians know this very well.""

The Syrian president has the freedom to get closer to the Iranians when the Russians are too demanding and vice versa, and when there are rifts, confirms Balanche. ""He knows how to manoeuvre between these two protectors that are a bit trapped in Syria, where they are obliged to stay after having invested a lot. This, while respecting the red lines that have surely been set for him, is his situation,"" he explained.

Who’s afraid of Biden?

In such a context, it remains to be seen whether the arrival of Joe Biden in the White House can revive the issue of a political transition in Syria since his predecessor, Donald Trump, had completely lost interest in the issue.

""When the Syrian regime was in the most difficulty, it was Barack Obama who was in power in the US and Joe Biden was his vice president,” recalled Mariotti. “Bashar al-Assad understood that he had little to fear, even after large scale chemical attacks. So, he should not be particularly terrified by the return of the Democrats to office. Joe Biden does not really wanting to start a tug-of-war with Moscow over an opposition that almost no longer exists.”

So, if he is assured of staying in power, can Assad hope for an international rehabilitation? Last week for instance, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates said tough US sanctions on Damascus were blocking Syria’s reconstruction and undermining regional reconciliation that could bring an end to 10 years of war.

Speaking alongside Russia’s visiting foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Dubai on March 9, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said the wider US sanctions imposed under the 2019 Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act were making it “difficult” to achieve Arab objectives, including Syria’s restoration to the Arab League. Syria was suspended from the pan-Arab organisation in late 2011 due to Assad’s ferocious crackdown on protesters, and several Gulf powers who backed Syrian rebel movements had been betting on Assad’s quick fall.

""In terms of rehabilitation, he is lucid and guesses that he does not have much hope regarding the West, because this would require the regime to make concessions that it cannot make in terms of human rights and a political transition,” noted Balanche.

“But Bashar al-Assad can renew ties with Arab countries that seem less closed to this idea than the Europeans and Americans,” he explained, adding, ""Damascus is especially looking towards Russia and China, which, in its eyes, embodies an alternative model to the Western one and with which Syria can deal economically without the question of human rights dominating the table.""

The United States “firmly opposes and is deeply disappointed” by the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) decision to open a war crimes investigation in the occupied Palestinian territories, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

The investigation, which was announced on Wednesday, comes after a February ICC determination that the occupied Palestinian territories fall under its jurisdiction, paving the way for an investigation of war crimes committed by both Palestinians and Israelis.

“The ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter. Israel is not a party to the ICC and has not consented to the Court’s jurisdiction, and we have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,” Blinken said in a statement.





“The Palestinians do not qualify as a sovereign state and therefore, are not qualified to obtain membership as a state in, participate as a state in, or delegate jurisdiction to the ICC,” he said.

A resolution passed by the United Nations in 2012 changed the occupied Palestinian territories from an “observer entity” to a “non-member observer state”, a de facto recognition of sovereignty that opened the door for the ICC’s ruling on jurisdiction.

The secretary of state added that the US “will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security, including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly”.

Mr. Blinken, why is it unfair to investigate allegations of serious international crimes, in the context of a 50-year military occupation that makes accountability at the domestic level impossible? Isn't that why the US helped create the ICC in 1998? https://t.co/pa9whMkTCi https://t.co/YAqENASD4m — Sari Bashi (@saribashi) March 4, 2021

The stance echoes that of Israel, who quickly decried the court’s investigation, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling the probe “the essence of anti-Semitism”.

Meanwhile, the ICC’s decision has been welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which called it “a long-awaited step that serves Palestine’s tireless pursuit of justice and accountability, which are indispensable pillars of the peace the Palestinian people seek and deserve”.

Hamas also praised the probe, while defending its own actions.

ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has said the inquiry into the “situation in Palestine” will be conducted “independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour”, but further details of the probe have not yet been released.

US sanctions

Blinken’s condemnation comes as pressure has grown for Washington to lift Trump era sanctions on Bensouda and other ICC staff.

During the two leaders’ first phone call, Netanyahu had reportedly pressured Biden to maintain the sanctions in light of the court’s determination of jurisdiction of the occupied Palestinian territories in February.

The US, which is not a party to the Rome Statute, the foundational and governing treaty of the ICC, has said it is reviewing the Trump sanctions, initially imposed as a response to an ICC investigation into Afghanistan that includes looking into US abuses committed there.





While Trump took an antagonistic approach to the court, his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had pursued a policy of “positive engagement” which saw the US supporting ICC investigations on an ad hoc basis.

The administration of President Joe Biden, which has emphasised human rights and a multilateral approach to foreign policy, was widely expected to take a similar tack, but the delay in lifting the Trump sanctions has raised questions over whether Biden will be colder towards the court than Obama, his former boss.

Biden’s State Department had in February praised the ICC for deciding to convict Dominic Ongwen, the commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), for war crimes committed in Uganda in the early 2000s.

In his statement on Wednesday, Blinken said the US “remains deeply committed to ensuring justice and accountability for international atrocity crimes” and recognises “the role that international tribunals such as the ICC can play”.

He added: “The ICC was established by its States Parties as a Court of limited jurisdiction. Those limits on the Court’s mandate are rooted in fundamental principles of international law and must be respected.”"
43,2021-03-03 00:00:00,Why Israel fears the ICC war crimes investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/mar/03/israeli-officials-start-to-feel-the-impact-of-icc-investigation,"The date of 13 June 2014 listed by the international criminal court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, as the starting point for its investigation into potential war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians is a significant one.
Tensions escalated rapidly: Israel would within weeks launch its third war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip while Palestinian militants would launch rockets into Israel.
And if there is a wider risk for Israel, it is that the broad framing of the probe will allow an investigation of other alleged crimes including Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories.
As Matthew Cannock, the head of Amnesty International’s centre for international justice, put it: “This is a momentous breakthrough for justice after decades of non-accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
“The ICC investigation provides the first genuine prospect for thousands of victims of crimes under international law to gain long overdue access to justice, truth and reparations.","war, international, fears, icc, investigation, israel, palestinians, crimes, palestinian, israeli, risk",war,Military Conflicts,"The date of 13 June 2014 listed by the international criminal court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, as the starting point for its investigation into potential war crimes committed by Israelis and Palestinians is a significant one.

The day before, as that year’s World Cup opened, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and murdered by a Hamas cell on the West Bank while hitchhiking in the occupied Palestinian territories.

Tensions escalated rapidly: Israel would within weeks launch its third war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip while Palestinian militants would launch rockets into Israel.

It was one of the deadliest conflicts between the two sides in decades. On the Palestinian side, more than 2,100 people – including civilians – were killed during 50 days of fighting. On the Israeli side, 67 Israeli soldiers and five civilians were killed.

If this conflict was different from previous wars, however, it was in the immediate recognition by some Israeli officials that there was a serious risk of investigation by the ICC that could ultimately lead to Israeli soldiers and politicians in the chain of command being investigated for war crimes.

That realisation prompted the Israeli military to quickly launch investigations by its military advocate’s department into some of the most controversial incidents in the conflict – a move that some critics suggested was designed to show that Israel had in effect investigated allegations even though it is not party to the international court.

The reality, however, is that the issue never went away – for reasons of both international politics and jurisprudence.

One year later, with the Middle East process moribund – and with memories of the conflict still raw – the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, became a signatory to the ICC and the Rome statute governing it, over Israeli objections that no Palestinian sovereign state existed and it was ineligible to join.

Part of the motivation for joining the ICC was the Palestinian Authority’s desire to “internationalise” a failed peace process long dominated by Washington. But the move marked a determination to pursue Israel in the court – not just for the 2014 war, but also for Israel’s continued policy of settlement-building and occupation.

In recent years Palestinians have won a series of victories, which began with the court’s key ruling that Palestinians had enough attributes of statehood to be a signatory and enter a complaint.

Then came the court’s ruling on 5 February that it had jurisdiction in the matter, opening the way for the announcement of Wednesday’s investigation.

While that decision has been described by Israel’s prime minister as “antisemitic”, what is clear is that the prosecutor’s office seems determined to examine alleged crimes on both sides including by Hamas.

And while the investigation and any trials that might follow could take years, the impact is already being felt.

Within hours of the announcement, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz was reporting Israeli plans to brief hundreds of senior security officials, past and present, over the risk of their exposure to prosecution. The country may warn them not to travel abroad once the investigation is launched over risk of arrest.

Among those who could be at risk, according to Haaretz, is Israel’s defence minister and leader of the Blue and White party, Benny Gantz, who was military chief of staff in 2014. And if there is a wider risk for Israel, it is that the broad framing of the probe will allow an investigation of other alleged crimes including Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories.

As Matthew Cannock, the head of Amnesty International’s centre for international justice, put it: “This is a momentous breakthrough for justice after decades of non-accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

“The ICC investigation provides the first genuine prospect for thousands of victims of crimes under international law to gain long overdue access to justice, truth and reparations.

“It is also a historic opportunity to finally put an end to the pervasive impunity that has driven serious violations in the occupied Palestinian territories for more than half a century.”"

The decision follows a ruling by the court on Feb. 5 that it has jurisdiction in the case, prompting swift rejections by Washington and Jerusalem.

“The decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,” Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement.

Promising a “principled, non-partisan, approach”, she said: “In the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides.”

Bensouda, who will be replaced by British prosecutor Karim Khan on June 16, said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She named both the Israel Defense Forces and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.

The next step will be to determine whether Israeli or Palestinian authorities have investigations themselves and to assess those efforts.

‘LONG-AWAITED STEP’

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court’s decision was “undiluted anti-Semitism and the height of hypocrisy.”

He accused the court of turning “a blind eye” to Iran, Syria and other countries that he said were committing “real” war crimes.

“Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists in the world who deliberately target civilians, it’s our soldiers who are war criminals,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the decision was “morally bankrupt and legally flawed,” while Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Gilad Erdan, vowed to “continue working together with the American administration against this shameful decision.”

The U.S. State Department said Washington firmly opposes and is disappointed by the announcement, adding that the United States has serious concerns over the ICC’s attempts to exercise jurisdiction over Israel.

“We will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security, including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly, the ICC ... has no jurisdiction over this matter,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

The prosecutor’s office was targeted by sanctions under then-U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington opposes the ICC investigation in Afghanistan, which is also looking at the role of U.S. forces, and the Palestinian Territories inquiry.

The Palestinian Authority’s foreign ministry welcomed the prosecutor’s investigation as “a long-awaited step that serves Palestine’s tireless pursuit of justice and accountability, which are indispensable pillars of the peace the Palestinian people seek and deserve”

It urged all states to “refrain from politicizing these independent proceedings.”

George Giacaman, a Palestinian political analyst and professor at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, said the ICC decision showed the Palestinian leadership’s strategy of appealing to global institutions had had some success.

While cautioning that the probe could take years, Giacaman said: “At best, one can say that in the future, the Israelis will be more careful with hitting Palestinian civilians. Perhaps the ICC will prove to be a deterrent.”

The Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza and is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the United States and the European Union, defended its own actions in the conflict.

“We welcome the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people. It is a step forward on the path of achieving justice,” said Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza.

Rights groups said the decision offered victims hope of justice. Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said ICC member countries should be ready to protect the court’s work from any political pressure.The ICC is a court of last resort established to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when a country is unable or unwilling to do so.

The pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, urged President Joe Biden to maintain the sanctions on ICC officials pursuing what it called “illegitimate, politically motivated investigations into the U.S. and Israel.”"

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) echoed that view: “Offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances.” Progressives in the House led by Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) promised to revive the effort to curb presidential war-making.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) underlined the true import, releasing a statement that he was “very concerned” that the action “puts our country on the path of continuing the Forever War instead of ending it. … This is the same path we’ve been on for almost two decades.”

Administration spokespeople defended the strikes as defensive and proportional. Biden aides boasted they sent a clear signal to the Iranians that America would defend U.S. soldiers in Syria and Iraq, even while seeking to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Missiles, however, are an inchoate messenger. After all, Iran proceeded to torpedo European Union efforts to kick-start talks on reviving the nuclear deal.

The argument that the strikes are a “defensive” measure mocks the reality of our presence there. Under President Barack Obama, the United States invaded Syria without permission or invitation as part of a ham-handed effort at regime change, just as we invaded Afghanistan to overturn its government and invaded Iraq in a war of choice to take down Saddam Hussein. For an aggressor to call the retaliatory exchange “defensive” doesn’t pass the smell test.

In fact, the greatest effect of the strikes is likely to be not on Iran or the Islamist terrorists but on the Biden administration itself. They make withdrawal from Syria harder and might begin to lock the administration into a commitment that should never have been made.

Obama and Trump both campaigned on the promise that they would end the wars in the Middle East. Both failed. Now the question is whether will Biden fail as well.

The same question is posed in Afghanistan where, unimaginably, the United States has been fighting for two decades. Against the resistance of his generals, Trump reduced U.S. forces to 2,500 and cut a deal with the Taliban to remove them in May. But there’s plenty of pressure on the new president to stay in the country. The Pentagon warns that withdrawal will lead to the collapse of the government the United States props up and to a wider civil war. A report from the congressionally created Afghanistan Study Group calls on the United States to postpone any withdrawal and instead condition it on Taliban behavior. If Biden accedes, the forever war will continue, well, forever — or at least until a new president is ready to accept reality and get out.

Interventionism is no small project. As the Brown University Costs of War project has documented, over the past three years alone, the United States has launched drones or airstrikes in seven countries, engaged in combat in eight, held military exercises in 41 and assisted counterterrorism actions in 85 countries. The wars have been going on for two decades at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives and at least $6.4 trillion.

The Biden team believes they can do it all: mobilize to meet the existential threat of climate change, rally global efforts to fight pandemics, rebuild America at home, take on China and Russia in a new great-power competition, strike at alleged terrorists in dozens of countries, sustain commitments across the Middle East and continue to police the world.

But if the debacles of recent years teach anything, it is that America can’t do it all. The fog of war is unpredictable. Great-power confrontations are costly and dangerous. Small forays turn into quagmires. Rebuilding America takes a back seat to foreign adventure. Biden has to choose.

Public disenchantment with the endless wars is clear and has been since George W. Bush declared Mission Accomplished. But the military-industrial complex that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us of decades ago still wields immense political clout. Politicians remain terrified of appearing weak. And sadly, the Biden foreign policy team includes no one who has been a clear and consistent opponent of our disastrous interventions across the world. The strike on Syria may have held the front pages for only a day, but it likely will have far greater implications for the rest of Biden’s presidency — and perhaps beyond."

The results independently reinforce findings from a similar study of bedrock beneath the center of Greenland, Christ said.
“The future loss of Greenland ice is not a foregone conclusion,” he said.","sea, project, warning, transmits, war, alert, warming, christ, today, point, cold, base, climate, sheet, secret, military, century, greenland, ice, world",war,Military Conflicts,"ILULISSAT, GREENLAND.

It’s like something out of a Hollywood blockbuster: a secret Arctic military base has revealed clues indicating that the world is in danger. Except in this case, the warning comes from hard science fact.

Analyzing ice core samples taken in the 1960s from a base built under the Greenland ice by the U.S. Army, geologists have been alarmed to discover that the Greenland ice sheet, which contains enough water to cause sea levels to rise by 20 feet worldwide, could melt more rapidly than previously thought. Should the ice sheet be lost, many of the world’s largest cities could end up underwater.

The findings, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show how preserved plants and fossils found within sediment from almost a mile beneath the ice indicate that the entire Greenland ice sheet vanished during a warm period in the last million years. With global temperatures today rising faster than at potentially any point in human history, the implications of the discovery are concerning.

“Our study shows that Greenland is much more sensitive to natural climate warming than we used to think,” said Andrew Christ, Gund Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Vermont (UVM) and lead author of the study. “We already know that humanity’s out-of-control warming of the planet hugely exceeds the natural rate.”

The ice cores were obtained in the 1960s from a cold war “city under the ice” in northwest Greenland. Operational from 1959, the sub-ice complex, named Camp Century, was at the center of the secretive Project Iceworm, a complex of tunnels planned to be 2,000 miles long, in which would be hidden 600 nuclear missiles in close proximity to the Soviet Union. At one point the complex had up to 200 residents and even boasted a movie theater and a nuclear reactor. Project Iceworm was never completed, but half a century later, the deepest of the cores taken from geological surveys at the base were discovered in a freezer in Denmark.

Christ told Forbes.com about the moment he found the frozen plant material that was the key to the discovery.

“We were jumping up and down in the lab when it happened,” Christ said. “It was one of those ‘Eureka!’ moments that I used to think were scientific fairytales, but it happened to us. It remains the most exciting day of science I’ve had in my life.”

Christ, along with Paul Bierman, professor of geoscience at UVM and the report’s senior author, instantly recognized the implications of their find.

“We immediately understood that this soil contained much more information about Greenland’s past climate history than we ever anticipated,” Christ said. “The presence of plant material meant the ice must have melted away to allow these plants to grow. That means whenever those tundra plants were alive, the ice sheet was smaller, and therefore sea level was higher.”

Using a barrage of advanced analytical techniques, from X-ray spectroscopy and electron microscopes to radiocarbon dating, the team was able to determine that at some point in the last million years, Greenland was indeed green—with moss and lichen, and possibly even spruce and fir trees.

The results independently reinforce findings from a similar study of bedrock beneath the center of Greenland, Christ said. “This is important because, during this time span, Earth’s climate did not get much warmer than it is today, but CO2 in the atmosphere never reached levels as high as they are today due to humans burning fossil fuels.”

Following initial analysis of the cores in 2019, Bierman said: “We should be hoping that this dirt has been covered for two or three million years or more … if this first look holds true, this is big-time bad news.”

The results published today confirm that the scientists’ initial concerns were well founded. On the release of the completed paper, Bierman was unequivocal about the threat revealed by the discovery: “This is not a twenty-generation problem. This is an urgent problem for the next 50 years,” he said. “Greenland may seem far away, but it can quickly melt, pouring enough into the oceans that New York, Miami, Dhaka—pick your city—will go underwater.”

Nevertheless, Christ pointed out that, unlike at any other point in history, humans now had some say over how severe global warming will be.

“The future loss of Greenland ice is not a foregone conclusion,” he said. “If humans act swiftly and urgently to reduce carbon emissions, we can avoid the worst case scenario of several meters of sea level rise from Greenland.”"

He holds sway over many parts of the country, helped by Russia’s military presence and Iran’s Shi’ite militias.

Hostile Turkey still controls swathes of territory in the northwest and the U.S. has a presence in the northeast, a major oil and wheat producing area.

But Assad’s biggest challenge now is the economy.

Post-war discontent with corruption, spiralling food prices, a collapsed currency, worsening power cuts and gasoline shortages have aggravated hardships for many families who have lost loved ones.

This is a timeline of how the conflict began with peaceful pro-democracy protests, then developed into a multi-sided conflict that sucked in world powers, killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more.

* March 2011 - The first big protests against Assad’s rule that began in Deraa in southern Syria spread across the country. Security forces respond with arrests and shootings.

* June 2012 - World powers meet in Geneva and agree on the need for a political transition, but divisions on how to achieve it will foil years of U.N.-sponsored peace efforts.

* July 2012 - Assad launches air raids on towns and cities that had rebelled against his rule, as once peaceful protesters now carry arms. Thousands are killed.

* Aug. 2013 - Washington declares the use of chemical weapons a red line, but a gas attack on densely populated rebel-held Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus kills hundreds of civilians without triggering a U.S. military response.

* Jan. 2014 - An al Qaeda splinter group seizes Raqqa before grabbing territory across Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate and renaming itself Islamic State.

Slideshow ( 4 images )

* Sept. 2014 - Washington builds an anti-Islamic State coalition and starts air strikes, helping Kurdish forces turn the jihadist tide but creating friction with ally Turkey.

* March 2015 - As Assad’s forces lose ground in many towns and cities that rose up against his one-party Baath rule, a mainstream armed insurgency composed of former demonstrators and army defectors is slowly undermined by Islamist militants helped by foreign jihadists coming to Syria.

* Sept. 2015 - Russia joins the war on Assad’s side, deploying warplanes and giving military aid that, with the help of Iran, swiftly turns the course of conflict against the rebels.

* Aug. 2016 - Alarmed by Kurdish advances on the border, Turkey launches an incursion with allied rebels, making a zone of Turkish control that it later extends in 2018.

* Dec. 2016 - The Syrian army and its allies defeat rebels in their biggest urban base of Aleppo after months of siege and bombardment, confirming Assad’s momentum.

* March 2017 - Israel acknowledges launching air strikes against Hezbollah in Syria, aiming to degrade the strength of Iran whose elite Quds forces and Shi’ite militias from Afghanistan and Lebanon steadily expand their influence in Syria.

* April 2017 - The United States launches a first cruise missile attack on a Syrian government airbase near Homs after a poison gas attack on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun.

* Nov. 2017 - U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces defeat Islamic State in Raqqa. That offensive, and a rival one by the Syrian army, drives the jihadists from nearly all their land.

* April 2018 - After months of blockade and air raids, the Russian-backed army recaptures Eastern Ghouta, before retaking the other insurgent enclaves in central Syria, and then the rebels’ southern bastion of Deraa in June.

* Sept. 2018 - A Russian-Turkish deal over Idlib and the rebel-held northwest freezes the frontlines and reduces the bombing raids that killed hundreds of civilians in the last major opposition bastion.

* March 2019 - As its local allies take Islamic State’s last area in the east, the United States decides to keep some troops in Syria after earlier saying it would pull out.

* April-Dec. 2019 - Russian-backed forces launch a campaign in the northwest that ends with the capture of a strategic rebel town of Khan Sheikhoun in August, a site of a major chemical attack on civilians.

* A Russian-Turkish summit in October reduces fighting until Moscow resumes a major assault in December that pushes deeper into the last opposition bastion.

* Dec. 2019 - March 2020 - The Russian-led offensive in northwest Syria displaces about one million civilians, marking the worst humanitarian crisis since the conflict began. Ankara sends thousands of soldiers across the border to help stem the offensive. Turkey says it will not stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe and opens its borders. Thousands flee for Greece.

Washington has taken aim at China’s tech industry during the bitter trade dispute, putting sanctions on firms including telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd, saying they are a threat to national security, angering Beijing.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan is home to a thriving and world-leading chip industry, and the government has long worried about China’s efforts to copy that success, through fair means or foul.

Speaking at a parliamentary committee meeting on how to respond to the “red supply chain” - a reference to the colour of China’s ruling Communist Party - Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the trade war had created new risks.

“Affected by the U.S.-China technology war, the development of mainland China’s semiconductor industry has been obstructed, but they are still committed to the industry’s development,” she said.

“In order to achieve self-sufficiency in the supply chain, poaching and infiltration are the quickest way for mainland China to do this,” Wang added.

Taiwan’s chip workers have deep experience and speak the same language, meaning they are a “natural target for poaching China has latched onto”, she added.

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hu Mu-yuan, deputy head of Taiwan’s National Security Bureau, said China’s efforts were a threat to not just Taiwan, but also Japan and South Korea, threatening global trade and fair competition.

“Moreover, the Chinese communists are stealing other countries intellectual property to boost their own power,” he added.

Taiwan has strict laws to try and prevent this from happening, but officials have warned China tries to skirt them by setting up front companies on the island, using Taiwanese headhunters and other methods.

“Preventing Taiwan’s key technology and high-tech personnel from being infiltrated by the ‘red supply chain’ has become an important task to protect our industry’s competitiveness and ensure our economic security,” Hu said."

The new patch is called Season 2 Reloaded and it includes new multiplayer maps, new zombies areas, balance changes, and a mysterious addition to Warzone. The patch will go live on March 30 at 12 a.m. EST.

Perhaps the biggest addition in Black Ops Cold War’s midseason update are its new maps. The first is a Strike variant of the Miami map, called Miami Strike. Miami Strike takes place during the day, fixing some of the original map’s annoying visual issues, and changes up the landscape a little bit by adding some new cars to the main road. There’s also a new gunfight map called Mansion.

But the real star of the Season 2 Reloaded patch is the new Golova map. This map is designed for multi-team battles and even includes a new version of Hardpoint, that accommodates 40 people, spread across several different teams, all vying to capture the point. It should make for massive and chaotic games, and a very different experience from Black Ops Cold War’s other modes.

Also in this update is a new region for the Zombies Outbreak map, called the Sanatorium, and it takes place entirely at night. Sanatorium has a new secret objective, new intel for players to find, and a new dirt bike vehicle.

Finally, the patch will help bring more big changes to Warzone, but we don’t know what those changes are just yet. According to Treyarch’s announcement, Raven Software will let fans know what’s coming to Warzone sometime in the near future.

What many Americans don’t realize is that years of classified Pentagon war games strongly suggest that the U.S. military would lose that war.
Because it lies only 90 miles from Taiwan, China needs only to hold U.S. forces at bay for a matter of weeks to achieve its strategic objective of capturing Taiwan.

Then a major Chinese military exercise was used as cover for the deployment of a massive invasion force. The simulation culminated with Chinese missile strikes raining down on U.S. bases and warships in the region, and a lightning air and amphibious assault on the island of Taiwan.

The highly classified war game, which has not been previously made public, took place less than a year after the coronavirus, reportedly originating in a Chinese market, spread to the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, taking one of the U.S. Navy’s most significant assets out of commission.

Then in September in the midst of the war game, actual Chinese combat aircraft intentionally flew over the rarely crossed median line in the Taiwan Strait in the direction of Taipei an unprecedented 40 times and conducted simulated attacks on the island that Taiwan’s premier called “disturbing.” Amid those provocations, China’s air force released a video showing a bomber capable of carrying nuclear weapons carrying out a simulated attack on Andersen Air Force Base on the U.S. Pacific island of Guam. The title of the Hollywood-like propaganda video was “The god of war H-6K [bomber] goes on the attack!”

In case the new U.S. administration failed to get the intended message behind all that provocative military activity, four days after President Biden took office, a large force of Chinese bombers and fighters flew past Taiwan and launched simulated missile attacks on the USS Roosevelt carrier strike group as it was sailing in international waters in the South China Sea.

Little wonder that many foreign affairs and national security experts believe the global pandemic has accelerated trends that were already pushing the United States and China toward a potential confrontation as the world’s leading status quo and rising power, respectively. This month the Council on Foreign Relations released a special report, “The United States, China, and Taiwan: A Strategy to Prevent War,” which concluded that Taiwan “is becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war” between the United States and China. In Senate testimony on Tuesday, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Phil Davidson, warned that he believes China might try and annex Taiwan “in this decade, in fact within the next six years.”

Story continues

Meanwhile, a leading Chinese think tank recently described tensions in U.S.-China relations as the worst since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and it advised Communist Party leaders to prepare for war with the United States.

What many Americans don’t realize is that years of classified Pentagon war games strongly suggest that the U.S. military would lose that war.

“More than a decade ago, our war games indicated that the Chinese were doing a good job of investing in military capabilities that would make our preferred model of expeditionary warfare, where we push forces forward and operate out of relatively safe bases and sanctuaries, increasingly difficult,” Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, told Yahoo News in an exclusive interview. By 2018, the People’s Liberation Army had fielded many of those forces in large numbers, to include massive arsenals of precision-guided surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, a space-based constellation of navigation and targeting satellites and the largest navy in the world.

“At that point the trend in our war games was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,” Hinote said. “After the 2018 war game I distinctly remember one of our gurus of war gaming standing in front of the Air Force secretary and chief of staff, and telling them that we should never play this war game scenario [of a Chinese attack on Taiwan] again, because we know what is going to happen. The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.”

With Beijing continuing to tighten an iron grip on Hong Kong, engaging in deadly skirmishes with India along their shared border and routinely bullying its smaller neighbors in the South China Sea, the Biden administration recently announced a new Pentagon task force to review U.S. defense policy toward China, to be headed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Inevitably, the deteriorating security of Taiwan will be a major focus of the new task force. “By the way, three of China’s standing war plans are built around a Taiwan scenario,” Hinote said. “They’re planning for this. Taiwan is what they think about all the time.”

In the early 2000s, China experts and military analysts at the RAND Corporation were given a trove of classified U.S. intelligence on Beijing’s military plans and weapons programs, and were asked to war-game a confrontation 10 years into the future. China was in the midst of an unprecedented economic growth spurt that saw its GDP increase annually by double digits, with commensurate steep increases in its defense spending. Equally worrisome, the PLA had clearly studied U.S. military operations over the course of two wars against Iraq. Both operations relied on a methodical, months-long buildup of forces to uncontested bases in the region, followed by U.S. aircraft dominating the skies and then carrying out devastating attacks on the enemy’s command-and-control systems.

China’s answer was a well-funded strategy that the Pentagon refers to as “anti-access, area denial” (A2/AD), meaning it would prevent an adversary like the U.S. from being able to carry out the sort of significant military buildup it carried during the two Iraq wars. The PLA’s military plans rely on space-based and airborne surveillance and reconnaissance platforms; massive precision-guided missile arsenals; submarines; militarized man-made islands in the South China Sea; and a host of conventional air and naval forces to hold U.S. and allied bases, ports and warships in the region at risk. Because it lies only 90 miles from Taiwan, China needs only to hold U.S. forces at bay for a matter of weeks to achieve its strategic objective of capturing Taiwan.

“Whenever we war-gamed a Taiwan scenario over the years, our Blue Team routinely got its ass handed to it, because in that scenario time is a precious commodity and it plays to China’s strength in terms of proximity and capabilities,” said David Ochmanek, a senior RAND Corporation analyst and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for force development. “That kind of lopsided defeat is a visceral experience for U.S. officers on the Blue Team, and as such the war games have been a great consciousness-raising device. But the U.S. military is still not keeping pace with Chinese advances. For that reason, I don’t think we’re much better off than a decade ago when we started taking this challenge more seriously.”

Part of the problem is that China advanced its A2/AD strategy while the Pentagon was largely distracted fighting counterterrorism and counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for two decades. Beijing is also laser-focused on Taiwan and regional hegemony, while the U.S. military must project power and prepare for potential conflict scenarios all around the globe, giving the Pentagon what Ochmanek calls an “attention deficit disorder.” Finally, there is the complacency of the perennial winner that makes it hard for senior U.S. military officers to believe that another nation would dare to take them on.

“My response is that China’s growing military confidence is manifesting itself in an increasingly belligerent approach to its neighbors, the growing frequency of the PLA’s violation of the airspace of Taiwan and Japan, and the bullying of other neighbors in the South China Sea,” said Ochmanek. “Under Xi Jinping there has been a dramatic increase in such provocations compared to a decade ago, and I think it’s grounded in his belief that militarily, China is strong enough now to credibly challenge us.”

By 2017 the Pentagon, led by then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, started to take notice.

“When we were developing the National Defense Strategy in 2017, the trend lines looked very bad vis-à-vis China, and got a lot worse as you projected into the future,” said Elbridge Colby, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development. “Yet despite that fact there were, and I think still are, a lot of people who resisted the idea that war with China is even possible, let alone losable. That’s why both strategic level and more operational war games were so important. They help show how these things are possible — but also how we can redress the problem.”

In 2018 the Defense Department issued a seminal National Defense Strategy identifying great-power competition with China and Russia, and not terrorism, as the primary challenge to the U.S. After the lopsided Blue Team defeat in the Air Force’s annual war game in 2018, senior officers and defense officials began giving a classified “Overmatch Brief” to select members of Congress.

In the most recent war game, the Pentagon tested the impact of potential capabilities and military concepts that are still on the drawing board in many cases. The Blue Team, which represented U.S. forces, adopted a more defensive and dispersed posture less reliant on large, vulnerable bases, ports and aircraft carriers in a conflict with the Red Team, which represented China.

The strategy strongly favored large numbers of long-range, mobile strike systems, to include anti-ship cruise missile batteries, mobile rocket artillery systems, unmanned mini-submarines, mines and robust surface-to-air missile batteries for air defense. A premium was put on surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities for both early warning and accurate intelligence to enable quicker decisions by U.S. policymakers, and a more capable command-and-control system to coordinate the actions of more dispersed forces.

“We created a force that had resiliency at its core, and the Red Team looked at that force and knew that it would take a tremendous amount of firepower to knock it out,” said Hinote. The biggest insight of the war game, he said, was revealed when he talked afterward with the Red Team leader, who played the role of the PLA’s top general.

“The Red Team leader is the most experienced and aggressive officer in these war games across the Defense Department, and when he initially looked at the resiliency of our defensive posture both in Taiwan and the region, he said, ‘No, I’m not going to attack,’” recalled Hinote. “If we can design a force that creates that level of uncertainty and causes Chinese leaders to question whether they can accomplish their goals militarily, I think that’s what deterrence looks like in the future.”

Despite loud alarms raised by the war games, the Pentagon has been slow to adjust its long-term spending plans or to invest in the kinds of military capabilities necessary to defend Taiwan or contested island chains in the South China Sea. Instead, older weapons systems like massive warships, short-range tactical fighter aircraft and heavy tank battalions continue to enjoy support from loyal constituencies both inside the Pentagon and in Congress. What’s needed, experts say, are bolder actions like the Marine Corps’ recent decision to completely divest itself of tanks and heavy armor by 2030 in order to invest in anti-ship missiles and mobile strike teams optimized for a conflict with China.

On a sober note, Hinote pointed out that the Blue Team force posture tested in the recent war game is still not the one reflected in current Defense Department spending plans. “We’re beginning to understand what kind of U.S. military force it’s going to take to achieve the National Defense Strategy’s goals,” he said. “But that’s not the force we’re planning and building today.”

Department of Defense investigators have identified the remains of U.S. Army chaplain and Catholic priest Emil Kapaun among the unknown Korean War soldiers buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.

It's been a long journey home for the Kansas native who was imprisoned in Korea more than 70 years ago.

Former President Barack Obama told Kapaun's story in 2013.

It was Nov. 2, 1950, when Kapaun's unit came under heavy fire from Chinese forces near Unsan in present-day North Korea and received orders to withdraw. Only a quarter of the unit's soldiers were able to get out. The others, including many wounded soldiers, were trapped.

Obama described Kapaun racing ""between foxholes, out past the front lines and into no-man's land — dragging the wounded to safety.""

Kapaun was captured and taken to a Chinese-run prison camp. He continued to minister to other prisoners and sacrificed for their well-being, Obama said.

Kapaun contracted dysentery and then pneumonia in prison. In May 1951, guards sent him into isolation, without food or water, to die. He was only 35 years old.

At the end of the war, surviving prisoners of war emerged from the camp with a 4-foot wooden crucifix they made in Kapaun's honor. The group spent months secretly collecting firewood, carving it, and using radio wire for a crown of thorns.

Obama called Kapaun's story ""amazing"" as he awarded him a posthumous Medal of Honor.

His remains were among those returned to U.S. custody as part of the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, but had been unidentified. His remains were previously among 867 buried as ""Unknowns"" in Hawaii.

But on Friday, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced Kapaun's remains were identified as a part of a program to disinter the unknown Korean War dead.

Ray Kapaun, Emil Kapaun's nephew, was tearful hearing the news of his uncle's identification in an interview with KWCH: ""There's no words that can explain what the feelings are right now.""

""I know there's been a lot of miracles that have been attributed to him, or are in the investigation of being attributed to him, but I think everyone sees this as a miracle,"" he added.

In 1993, after extensive lobbying from fellow POW's, Kapaun was named a ""Servant of God,"" by Pope John Paul II, the first step on the way to being declared a saint.

The design of the banknote was unveiled before it is set to be formally issued to the public on June 23, Turing's birthday. The 50-pound note is the most valuable denomination in circulation but is little used during everyday transactions, especially during the coronavirus pandemic as digital exchanges increasingly replaced the use of cash.

The new note, which is laden with high-level security features, completes the bank's rejig of its stable of paper currencies over the past few years. Turing's image joins that of Winston Churchill on the five-pound note, novelist Jane Austen on the 10-pound note and artist J. M. W. Turner on the 20-pound note. All the notes are made from polymer rather than paper, which means they should last longer and remain in better condition through their use.

The new note incorporates two windows and a two-colour foil that designers say will make it very difficult to counterfeit. There is also a hologram image that changes between the words “Fifty” and “Pounds” when the note is tilted from side to side, as well as an embedded microchip to pay tribute to Turing's role in the birth of computers.

Turing was selected as the new face of the 50-pound note in 2019 following a public nomination process, recognition of his pivotal role in breaking Nazi Germany's Enigma code during World War II. The code had been believed to be unbreakable as the cypher changed continuously. Historians say the cracking of the code may have helped shorten the war by at least two years, potentially saving millions of lives.

The 250,000 or so votes supporting Turing's nomination also represented a recognition of the discrimination that he faced as a gay man after the war.

“There’s something of the character of a nation in its money, and we are right to consider and celebrate the people on our banknotes,"" Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey said.

“Turing is best known for his codebreaking work at Bletchley Park, which helped end the Second World War. However, in addition, he was a leading mathematician, developmental biologist, and pioneer in the field of computer science. He was also gay, and was treated appallingly as a result.""

During World War II Turing worked at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking centre, where he helped crack Enigma by creating the “Turing bombe,” a forerunner of modern computers. He also developed the “Turing Test” to measure artificial intelligence.

After the war, he was prosecuted for homosexuality, which was then illegal, and forcibly treated with female hormones — a form of chemical castration. His conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). He died at age 41 in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide.

Turing received a posthumous apology from the British government in 2009, and a royal pardon in 2013. Four years later, the Turing law, which pardoned gay men with past convictions, was passed.

Actor and author Stephen Fry said the choice of Turing to appear on the 50-pound note marks another step in the nation’s long overdue recognition of “this very great man,” whose “talents ranged far and wide.”

In a YouTube video posted by the Bank of England, Fry laid out the levels of discrimination and “barbaric punishments” that gay men faced in the years after World War II.

“Alan Turing was among the thousands of men who were harried and harangued by the authorities,"" he said.

“Not just down to the hostile attitude to their sexuality alone, but also under the bigoted belief that there was a link between homosexuality and communism,"" Fry added.

Over the past decade, Turing's life has become known to a much wider audience, especially in the wake of the 2014 film “The Imitation Game” that saw Benedict Cumberbatch play the role of Turing.

Great-nephew James Turing, who runs the Turing Trust which refurbishes U.K. computers for use in African schools, said the Bank of England’s move was an ""unbelievable honour” for his family.

“It certainly highlights the enormity of Alan’s legacy, which hopefully we are doing something through the Turing Trust that he would be proud of in continuing to further enable access to a digital world,"" he told BBC radio.

A decade of war in Syria has left young Syrians with heavy personal losses and yet to face the rebuilding of their shattered homeland.

A new survey by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of 1,400 Syrian nationals living in Syria or in exile in Lebanon and Germany, highlighted on Wednesday the costs for those aged 18 to 25 of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands, displaced millions more and destroyed schools and hospitals.

“One of the shocking results of this survey is that we realised that 50 percent of Syrians had friends or a family member who was killed … One out of six Syrians had one of their parents either killed or wounded,” Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters news agency.

“Rebuilding the country is on their shoulders and obviously it’s quite unfair.”

The report coincides with the 10th anniversary of the start of protests against President Bashar al-Assad’s rule that turned into a full-scale civil war.

Assad’s military has now regained control of most of the country with the help of Russia and Iran.

Nearly half of young Syrians lost their income because of the conflict and almost eight in 10 reported struggling to afford food and other necessities, the report showed.

“Women have been particularly hard hit economically, with almost 30 percent in Syria reporting no income at all to support their family,” the ICRC said.





Worsening conditions

Ahmad, originally from Homs and living in Lebanon, said his situation is worsening by the day.

“I had more money when I was 10 years old than now when I am 24. I have nothing of my personal belongings I used to have at home,” he said in the report.

A video released by the ICRC shows 33-year-old Mouna Shawat, on crutches, walking on one foot past blocks of bombed-out buildings on streets full of rubble in the Syrian city of Aleppo before being fitted with a prosthetic device at a rehabilitation centre.

Shawat’s lower left leg had to be amputated several years ago after an IED blew up as she made her way home.

“We had everything – gas, diesel, services. Now we are cold and hungry, and we need to wait for gas to get warm. Sometimes we have to cook over a fire,” Shawat, who lives with her two children in Aleppo, recalled with nostalgia her youth before the civil war.

Referring to her children’s anxiety over her lost leg, she said: “To this day, every time it comes up they start crying, I try to comfort them.”"

It is one of very few major international organizations to operate in Nagorno-Karabakh, and does so against the will of the Azerbaijani government.
""Armenia can ill afford to turn against its few friends in this time of post-war crisis.""
Even if the spying allegations are unfounded, though, how to explain how both Clark‑Hattingh and HALO were targeted by official structures?","war, international, spy, armenian, artsakh, armenia, amok, halo, organizations, british, armenians, avagyan, mania, clarkhattingh, running, postwar",war,Military Conflicts,"In the search for scapegoats, there is one classic fallback: the foreign spy.

This week, Armenians accused two prominent foreign organizations of spying for the enemy during the war. Both accusations, in their own way, are deeply improbable and speak more than anything else to the desperate search for answers following last year’s traumatic defeat to Azerbaijan.

The first accusation was indirect: The head of the UNICEF office in Armenia, Marianne Clark‑Hattingh, was accused, via a widely read Telegram news channel, of having spied for the UK and Azerbaijan during the war. While a report like that might normally have been dismissed as gossip or disinformation, the day after it came out, Armenia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that it had suspended her tenure in the country. It cited, vaguely and intriguingly, only “failures in implementing her mandate and uncooperative conduct.”

The prosecutor’s office said was looking into the spying allegations, and Clark‑Hattingh left the country, the local UNICEF office reported. Her Twitter account was deleted. UN officials strongly denied the accusations. “The spying allegations against her are baseless, and I would defend her strongly,” a UN spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said on March 10.

But the innuendos continued. “It is strange why she was not declared internationally wanted, but was only dismissed by government decision,” the newspaper Zhoghovurd, known for its anti-government stance, wrote. “How did she manage to leave Armenia unhindered? In any case, we do not know where Marianne Clark-Hattingh was during the days of the 44-day war, what information she possessed, why during that she never reacted to Azerbaijan's various atrocities against children?”

This curious story was followed by an even more surprising allegation: that the demining NGO Halo Trust had given intelligence to Turkey during last year’s war. And this allegation was more direct, from the special representative of the de facto president of Nagorno-Karabakh.

“I learned from reliable sources that the HALO Trust, which operated under the name of a British charitable organization and was engaged in landmine clearance, obtained maps of the minefields of the Armenian side during its activities in Artsakh and handed them over to the Turkish special services,” the adviser, Boris Avagyan, told local news site 24News. (Artsakh is an Armenian name for the region.) “As a result, the enemy was able to successfully pass through the minefields during the war. Under the pretext of studying dangerous areas, the company carried out reconnaissance operations throughout the territory of Artsakh.” Avagyan later added that he had referred the claim to the security services of Karabakh.

Halo denied the reports, calling them “totally false.”

And a spokesperson for the de facto president said that Avagyan was speaking for himself. “Boris Avagyan doesn’t have this kind of authority,” the spokesperson, Lusine Avanesyan, said. “I will also note that Avagyan is not connected in any way with the issues he’s expressing an opinion on. HALO Trust has worked in Artsakh for many years and continues to work today.”

Both organizations seem to have gotten wrapped up in a conspiracy theory widespread among Armenians that the UK supports Azerbaijan because of the significant role that British energy giant BP plays in the Caspian gas and oil business. The conspiracy theory doesn’t seem to go farther than that: There is no evidence that the UK did any more or less than the (very little) that other Western countries did during the war, or that Azerbaijan needed any British support. But the fact that Clark-Hattingh is a Briton and HALO is UK-based and its international staff in the region are mostly former British military officers seems to have contributed to the paranoia. (President Armen Sarkissian, who had and reportedly still has British citizenship – he hasn’t said – also has been implicated, with many claiming that he has some allegiance to the UK.)

The twin allegations are symptoms of a post-war ""state of denial"" that has trapped Armenians and the Armenian government, said Richard Giragosian, the head of the Yerevan think tank Regional Studies Center. Now, ""that state of denial has only deepened, moving in a strange new direction of embracing conspiracy theories,"" Giragosian told Eurasianet. ""Although driven by a sense of betrayal by the West and a profound insecurity by the heightened threat perception of both Azerbaijan and Turkey, there has been a dangerous and bizarre move targeting British interests.""

During the war, people on both sides accused many international organizations of trying to create a false balance, and among Armenians, UNICEF was one of the prominent targets. Neutrally worded social media posts calling attention to children suffering on both sides of the conflict got hundreds of negative comments from Armenians calling them to take a stronger position against Azerbaijan.

Karabakh’s then-human rights ombudsman, Artak Beglaryan, accused UNICEF of “selective” sympathy. “Where is the UN when Artsakh civilians are killed and suffering by Azerbaijani aggression? No visit, no word, no help.”

While many international organizations got that kind of treatment, HALO wasn’t one of them, making that accusation all the more puzzling. HALO was unique among these sorts of organizations for its reputation (both among Armenians and Azerbaijanis) for taking an unequivocally pro-Armenian stand. It is one of very few major international organizations to operate in Nagorno-Karabakh, and does so against the will of the Azerbaijani government. It gets much of its funding from the global Armenian diaspora, and when the U.S. government cut off funding in 2019 Armenian-American lobby groups claimed that it was the result of Azerbaijani pressure.

That has not protected HALO from further insinuations. One opposition-friendly Armenian news website reposted a social media post by a Russian journalist claiming that in Chechnya, “HALO Trust was training militants. Under the guise of training volunteers to demine the territory, they were preparing specialists in mine-sabotage work.” (It should be noted that many of the more lurid allegations around these affairs are coming from sources friendly to Armenia’s political opposition and/or Russian hardliners.)

I asked Eurasianet’s correspondent in Armenia, Ani Mejlumyan, what she made of all this, and she pointed out that if Armenians really had evidence that anyone was passing on information to foreign intelligence agencies, then it would be in the hands of Armenia’s National Security Service. And if they had it, it would have already been leaked to Mikayel Minasyan, an opposition-connected figure who has been publishing a steady stream of information damaging to the current authorities.

""While this paranoid over-reaction may be seen as an unsurprisingly emotional response to the shock of the unexpected loss, it raises serious concerns and poses significant challenges for the future of the country, both in terms of political discourse and institutional democracy,"" Giragosian said. ""Armenia can ill afford to turn against its few friends in this time of post-war crisis.""

Even if the spying allegations are unfounded, though, how to explain how both Clark‑Hattingh and HALO were targeted by official structures? Clearly there is far more going on than is currently visible.

What is evident, though, is that the episode illustrates the loss of authority of international institutions in the region. It’s a phenomenon we’ve seen on both sides.

For many Azerbaijanis, one major lesson of the war was that all of the pre-war diplomacy and peacebuilding that international organizations carried out was useless: They got what they wanted and the only help they got from outside was Turkish military support. Armenians, conversely, saw the lack of international support as a betrayal, and as a lesson that in the future they can only count on themselves. It’s shaping up to be a more isolated, insular Caucasus."

Most recently, of course, this occurred in 1914 when the major European powers – who were deeply intertwined both by royal family relationships and economic networks – stumbled into the devastating First World War.
And the likely flashpoint is at sea – over the disputed waters of the vast South China Sea.
Collectively we have to imagine the disaster of a possible war between the U.S. and China, so we can reverse engineer and prevent it.
The chances of the U.S. and China stumbling into a war are real and increasing.","war, china, sleepwalk, sea, chinese, waters, sides, taiwan, status, military, world",war,Military Conflicts,"China and the United States today are on a collision course. No less an authority than Henry Kissinger said just over a year ago that the U.S. and China are in the “foot hills of a Cold War.” Our assessment is that both nations are rapidly ascending the slope of that metaphorical mountain, and will likely find themselves in a full-blown, Cold War-like status in the near future. By 2034, the year in which we set our new novel, could this lead the two nations to a hot war? Even a nuclear exchange? Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

The two nations are significantly at odds over the status of the South China Sea, which China claims as territorial waters, potentially giving them control over rich oil and gas deposits and dominance over the 40% of the world’s trade that passes through these strategic seas. The U.S., and most of the rest of the world, believes these waters to be high seas, free for any nation to sail. China is expanding its Navy rapidly (they already have more warships than the U.S.) and building artificial islands throughout the South China Sea to operate as strategic military nodes.

China and the U.S. are also in disagreement over a wide variety of trade and tariff rules attendant to an unbalanced trading relationship; significant intellectual property theft accusations by the U.S. against China; offensive cyber activities undertaken by both sides; widespread human rights violations against the Muslim Uighur population within China; and the status of Hong Kong, where the U.S. believes China to be in violation of the treaty which returned the former British colony to a “special status” within China.

There are profound differences over control of the emerging 5G networks and the status of Chinese company Huawei as a provider; retaliation against American companies in China who refuse to toe the line on Chinese policy issues (such as the status of Taiwan and the treatment of Uighurs); the devastating results of COVID-19 in the U.S. originating from a virus that first started to spread in Wuhan; and the freedom of Taiwan to decide whether or not to eventually unify politically with China.

History is replete with examples of the so-called “Thucydides trap” articulated by Harvard political scientist Graham Allison. Whenever a rising power (in this case China) confronts an established power (the U.S.) over the past two thousand years, the outcome very often leads to a global conflict. This occurs despite the fact that in most cases there is no advantage to either side in launching into a war.

Most recently, of course, this occurred in 1914 when the major European powers – who were deeply intertwined both by royal family relationships and economic networks – stumbled into the devastating First World War. More recently, the world dodged a serious bullet in the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, narrowly missing a nuclear exchange that would have destroyed much of the planet.

What feels different now is the size of the growing basket of disagreements coupled with domestic political pressures on both sides of the Pacific. President Xi is seeking to consolidate power and President Biden is governing with a narrow majority. For both, it is easy to point to the other as the aggressor, militarily and economically. Add the pandemic as an additional pressure point and it is clear the relationship is fraught.

And the likely flashpoint is at sea – over the disputed waters of the vast South China Sea. The U.S. is conducting frequent “freedom of navigation” patrols, sailing its warships throughout the disputed waters, often very close to China’s coast. China views this the way most of us would feel if a neighbor started to drive “donut holes” in our lawn. The Chinese Navy and Air Force frequently respond aggressively. The U.S will continue these patrols, and will pressure allies to come and participate – we are deeply and rightfully invested geopolitically in the values of high seas freedom.

And the patrols are conducted on both sides by relatively young military leaders – men and women in their 20s and 30s. We both personally know the mettle, pride, and attitude of these young warriors, and they will not back down. Either side could easily miscalculate, the other side would respond more aggressively, and the ladder of escalation could easily begin. A Chinese jet shot down or an American destroyer hit by a Chinese missile could cause deaths and ramp up feelings of national pride both in Beijing and Washington, especially in the wake of U.S. elections in which both Democrats and Republicans used China as a rhetorical punching bag.

If such an incident occurred, perhaps in the Taiwan Straits adding in the additional factor of extreme Chinese pride and nationalism over their view of Taiwan as a sovereign part of China, it could easily spark a far larger military exchange than the warning shots and close approaches we have seen thus far.

We say in the military, “when you release ordnance and people die, everything changes.” It is like kicking a door open into a very dark room. Outcomes become much harder to predict. Larger strikes from either side could follow, as could a far broader cyberattack, perhaps against critical infrastructure. Carrier strike groups on both sides could deploy head-to-head. With even more significant losses, the temptation to employ a tactical nuclear weapons – perhaps at sea, thinking it could never then escalate to a strategic exchange – might rise.

All of this seems unimaginable. Yet so often our challenges in responding to the greatest threats are not failures of intelligence, but rather failures of imagination. We never imagined Pearl Harbor; or a devastating attack on the U.S. that destroyed the World Trade Towers; or a twenty year war in Afghanistan; or a global pandemic. Collectively we have to imagine the disaster of a possible war between the U.S. and China, so we can reverse engineer and prevent it.

The chances of the U.S. and China stumbling into a war are real and increasing. It will require not only imagination, but the hard work of creating a national strategy that can employ all our considerable tools of state – diplomacy, economics, military deterrence, culture, communications – if we are to avoid sleepwalking into a 21st century war.

But the least that outsiders can do is to speak of the start of the violence accurately and name the perpetuators.

The U.N.’s last attempt at an estimate was 400,000 dead, issued by then-Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in 2016. Even at that time, the number barely reflected the actual human cost. It became impossible to count the death toll from the daily bombardments, and even more impossible to set a figure for those who later succumbed to their wounds, died from preventable diseases, or starved to death as a result of barbaric sieges—or the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who disappeared, summarily executed or tortured to death in the Assad regime’s death camps . The circle of suffering goes beyond the dead: rape victims, torture victims, traumatized children, widows and widowers, displaced people. It’s a list with no end.

This week marks the 10-year anniversary of the first anti-government protests that broke out in Damascus and Aleppo in March 2011 . But this solemn date marks only the start of the Syrian revolution, not the opening shot of the Syrian civil war, which began only after months of a brutal crackdown that had already left thousands of people dead at the hands of the regime’s security forces. That violence, initiated by President Bashar al-Assad, began the largest human-made human catastrophe since World War II, on a scale so unfathomable that the United Nations officially abandoned trying to count the death toll in January 2014 .

The world doesn’t even seem interested in counting anymore. But the least that outsiders can do is to speak of the start of the violence accurately and name the perpetuators.

The Syrian civil war must be defined not by the defiance and courage of those who took to the streets in 2011 but instead by the slogan Assad’s personal militias used to drive fear into the hearts of the Syrian people: “Assad or no one. Assad or we burn the country.” This is the only promise the regime has ever kept. This is why it is wrong to mark this date as the start of the Syrian civil war: Syrians did not choose to become the victims of a violent military crackdown for one man’s lust for power; it was a crime perpetrated against them.

The war didn’t begin when the marches started, and it hasn’t ended even as much of the opposition has crumbled or been crushed. Syria lies in smoldering ruins, with Assad sitting on top of most of regime-held territory, but in reality parts of the country are now effectively governed by Russian- and Iranian-backed militias. Far from “Assad or no one,” the Syrian people now have Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah, Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Russian’s Vladimir Putin to add to that list. This is not peace; it is a set of interlocking warlords who depend on daily violence to keep their power intact.

Syria’s economy has collapsed to depths unprecedented even during the height of the violence, with the value of the Syrian pound plummeting daily. As of March 16, it was 4,550 Syrian pounds to the U.S. dollar. For context, its prewar value was roughly 50 Syrian pounds to the dollar; comparatively, the Syrian pound was trading at roughly 600 to the dollar in 2016. But even before the recent spiral, the regime had done virtually nothing in the way of reconstruction, with areas it captured years ago still lying in ruins.

The regime’s allies in Iran and Russia will not fund reconstruction, instead looking to the European Union and others to foot the bill for their destruction of Syria’s infrastructure.The regime’s allies in Iran and Russia will not fund reconstruction, instead looking to the European Union and others to foot the bill for their destruction of Syria’s infrastructure. The West will not open the coffers, nor will it drop sanctions, without progress toward a political transition that the Assad regime burned the country to avoid pursuing.

Even if the moral and ethical horror of renormalization of the Assad regime could be negotiated or ignored, the regime, as all available evidence indicates from its behavior, would only use additional funding to rebuild its security state and continue to use aid as a weapon of war, something that the U.N. has shamefully enabled from its office in Damascus since day one.

The situation is equally as bleak in the areas outside of regime control. Idlib is the last standing opposition enclave in Syria, a de facto Turkish protectorate. It is home to more than 3 million people, the vast majority forcibly displaced from areas besieged and bombed with unrelenting barbarity.

The population there lives at the mercy of either Turkish-backed opposition forces, guilty of human rights abuses and summary executions, who have also been recently conscripted by Turkey’s own autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdogan into his foreign military incursions into Azerbaijan and Libya, or the fundamentalist former al Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, again guilty of widespread abuses.

The people of Idlib are trapped on all sides, facing a closed Turkish border on one end and the regime’s forces on the other. Despite a Turkish-Russian cease-fire largely holding in the enclave, residential parts of the Idlib governorate are still subjected to artillery strikes from a regime that has never dropped its promise to recapture “every inch” of Syria. Idlib today faces a precarious future as a besieged, impoverished, and lawless Syrian Gaza Strip, living solely at the mercy of warlords and international powers almost indifferent to or actively enabling their plight.

What little influence the Western powers have on the ground in Syria is confined to small pockets surrounding U.S. forces, such as the Tanf border crossing with Jordan, and in northeastern Syria alongside their allies in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), essentially a U.S.-backed offshoot of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), a separatist movement with its own human rights issues that finds itself in an uncomfortable partnership with both its unreliable U.S. ally and the Assad regime and Moscow. The SDF also finds itself in the unfortunate position of managing the indefinite detainment of Islamic State fighters, despite having no infrastructure or political autonomy.

Syria today is a failed state, effectively Balkanized into competing spheres of influence. It is teetering on the brink of famine, with a staggering 90 percent of the population living below the poverty line, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Even with those shocking figures, the regime and Russia continue to deliberately hamper international aid efforts, the cruelty acting as a critical component of the regime’s total grip on power.

While the future of Syria remains unwritten, the next 10 years look to be at least as painful as the last. It is not only Syria’s territorial map that has become locked in stalemate; the political and diplomatic process is almost nonexistent. The war is not over, just in stasis, and the suffering continues in a landscape so broken and chaotic that even the highest authorities on the planet cannot meaningfully quantify the dead.

Suffering is the only certainty left in Syria. Assad has not won anything. There are no victors in the country’s future, only victims and perpetrators, and an international community that stood aside and watched while millions of people were slaughtered and displaced.

When we mark the anniversary of those 2011 protests, we should remember the memory of those who marched arm in arm carrying flowers and singing songs of peace, not those who burned the country to stop them. That dignity is the very least we can still offer."
