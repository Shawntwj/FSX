The former commanders were also accused of other war crimes connected with the treatment of kidnap victims, including murder and torture, among others.
By accepting the accusations, the former commanders could face restrictions on their freedoms for five to eight years.
If they had rejected them, the commanders would have faced up to 20 years in prison, per the terms of the peace deal.
