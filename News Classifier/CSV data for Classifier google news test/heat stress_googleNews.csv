A recent study published by Nature Climate Change found that cities are at a greater risk than suburban and rural areas for heat stress, water scarcity, air pollution and energy insecurity due to their design and population density, Science Daily reported.
Until recently, the ability to predict these future climate scenarios in cities remained unclear.
“The model predicts that by the end of this century, average warming across global cities will increase by 1.9 degrees Celsius with intermediate emissions and 4.4 C with high emissions,” Zhao told Science Daily.

A recent study published by Nature Climate Change found that cities are at a greater risk than suburban and rural areas for heat stress, water scarcity, air pollution and energy insecurity due to their design and population density, Science Daily reported. Until recently, the ability to predict these future climate scenarios in cities remained unclear. “Incorporating these types of small-scale variables into climate modeling is crucial for understanding future urban climate,” Lei Zhao, a University of Illinois Urbana Champaign engineer and lead researcher of the study told Science Daily. “However, finding a way to include them in global-scale models poses major resolution, scale and computational challenges.” The team of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Princeton University approached this “urban-to-global information gap” by combining a broader-scale process that predicts how greenhouse gas emissions impact the global climate and a statistical model that copies a model for urban landscapes, according to Science Daily.

By applying this technique to data from 26 global climate models, the researchers were able to make projections on temperature and humidity changes in cities through the end of the century. “The model predicts that by the end of this century, average warming across global cities will increase by 1.9 degrees Celsius with intermediate emissions and 4.4 C with high emissions,” Zhao told Science Daily. “Our findings highlight the critical need for global projections of local urban climates for climate-sensitive urban areas,” Zhao added. “This could give city planners the support they need to encourage solutions such as green infrastructure intervention to reduce urban heat stress on large scales.” In 2019, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, in Phoenix, Arizona, reported 197 heat-related fatalities.

“It was the highest number of heat-associated deaths on record for the county, and the fourth year in a row of record-setting heat deaths there,” The Washington Post reported. “Those numbers are only expected to increase as the climate changes.” This year, Phoenix recorded its two hottest months in July and August. Building tall structures that trap heat and paving over the natural desert, which absorbs heat, are some of the ways in which the city’s development has made it even hotter, the article stated. “We talk about climate… as something mysterious and ambiguous that comes from the sky. But it is also something we are driving with the way we are paving our streets,” David Hondula, a sustainability scientist at Arizona State University told The Washington Post. “Urbanization is a critical part of the story.” Solutions like Nature’s Cooling Systems, a project aiming to implement green design in communities, could alleviate heat stress in Phoenix’s neighborhoods."

The effect of hot weather is not always immediate and can build up over a number of days.

While hot stretches are nothing new, WA Health Chief Health Officer Dr Andrew Robertson said some people are particularly vulnerable.

""The elderly, babies and those with chronic diseases are more prone to heat stress than most people,"" Dr Robertson said.

""The body normally sweats to cool itself, but for the elderly and the very young, the body cannot always regulate temperature changes efficiently, particularly when the temperature is over 32 degrees – which leads to heat stress.""

For this reason, the Department of Health recommends taking preventative steps to avoid heat related illness.

Dr Robertson said people who worked outside or who were not used to the heat, such as overseas travellers, are often at a higher risk.

""It is particularly important that people are aware of the risks of heat stress when they head outdoors to enjoy activities,"" Dr Robertson said.

""People should ensure they have ample supplies of non-alcoholic cool drinks and good sun protection.""

“Symptoms may range from mild to severe and can include rashes, cramps, headache, nausea and excessive or inadequate sweating. It can also exacerbate existing health conditions.”

“Checking on families and friends who may be vulnerable to heat, particularly the elderly and the sick, to ensure they are taking precautions and coping adequately, is also very important,” he said.

The Department of Health is advising Western Australians who experience severe symptoms, such as a high body temperature; nausea; dry, red, hot skin; and a rapid heart rate to seek urgent medical advice.

People should take the following precautions to help prevent heat-related illness:

never leave anyone in a closed car

drink plenty of water and fluids (note: If your doctor normally limits your fluids or you are on fluid tablets, you may need to check how much to drink while the weather is hot)

limit or avoid alcohol

stay indoors, in air-conditioning if possible

take a cool shower or bath

wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing

apply sunscreen at regular intervals while outdoors

reduce physical activity

avoid outdoor activity during the hottest part of the day

if possible, stay in shaded areas when outdoors

don't rely on fans unless there is adequate ventilation.

Make sure you know the signs of heat stress (muscle cramps, pallor, dizziness, headache, nausea increased heart rate, fainting, excessive sweating or no sweating with high temperature and hot, dry skin) and seek medical attention if necessary.

Misset International brands All About Feed, Poultry World, Pig Progress and Dairy global are publishing a special magazine on Heat Stress in April 2021. Focusing on solutions to minimise the impact of heat stress on farm animals. Don’t miss out and reserve your advertising space now.

Heat stress occurs when an animal’s heat load is greater than its capacity to lose heat. It can cast a shadow over the performance and profitability of livestock production. High environmental temperature is not the only reason that causes elevated body temperature but a combination of environmental temperature and relative humidity could be to blame too.

Heat stress in farm animals

Heat stress in dairy cows can cause a significant drop in milk production as well as having a negative affect on fertility and reproductive performance. In broilers and laying hens, heat stress can reduce growth rates, decrease egg production and reduce the quality of meat and eggs. Pigs are also sensitive to heat stress and sunburn. They have relatively small lungs and no sweat glands so are unable to keep themselves cool. Heat stress seems to be an underestimated problem but, to a large extent, one that could be easily solved.

Led by the University of Melbourne and in collaboration with University of Ghana, researchers at the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences investigated the effect of summer heat on a lactating herd of 120 Holstein Friesian cows at the university's robotic milking farm in Dookie, north-east Victoria.

READ MORE:Consistency key to calf rearing success

They found that heat stress could be reduced through the provision of shade and more water troughs.

A number of tests were undertaken to monitor the cows during the summer period between December 2018 and February 2019.

The University of Melbourne lead researcher Dr Surinder Chauhan and his team measured the effect of high temperature and humidity on the cows' respiratory rate, panting scores and body temperature.

""We were there on all the days that were above 28 degrees, examining the behaviour of the animals to see how the cows were responding to environmental heat,"" Dr Chauhan said.

""One of the things we noticed was on the days when the ambient temperature was above 32 degrees, 95 per cent of the cows were seeking shade.

""Then we found that 60pc of the cows were actually standing near the water troughs trying to jump in or waiting for the opportunity to drink.""

Cows seek shade at the University of Melbourne's Dookie, Victoria farm.

The results showed that very hot and humid conditions led to a significant drop in milk production as most cows stopped grazing, sought shade, panted and spent more time at watering points.

""Along with high ambient temperature, humidity is very important too, if it is really humid it is very difficult for an animal to lose heat from the body,"" Dr Chauhan said.

""When it was an extremely hot day - about 37 degrees - the cows that were extremely stressed preferred to jump into the water trough,"" he said.

Heat stress not only includes heat from the environment but also the metabolic heat produced by the cow itself to support bodily functions.

High producing lactating dairy cattle tend to be more sensitive to heat stress because of their increased metabolic heat production, which is a result of their higher feeding requirements to support high milk yield.

""Our previous research has shown that continuous genetic selection of dairy cows for improved feed intake and higher milk yield may also affect the heat tolerance of cows with negative association between thermotolerance (the ability to tolerate heat) and production traits,"" Dr Chauhan said.

""When we talk about improving heat tolerance in animals, one of the ways to do that is in the selection of our animals.

""Traditionally, if you look at the last 20 years, animals have been selected for production and as a result, unintentionally, heat tolerance has not been the major focus when selecting animals.

""We need to do more research to find that balance where the animals are heat tolerant but are also optimum producers.""

Dr Chauhan said that while the research indicates over summer months cows can experience severe heat stress, there are actions that farmers can take to improve livestock welfare such as the provision of shade to protect cows from solar radiation and water for the cows to cool down.

""What we have seen, because we had all the strategies that farmers can use, physical modification of the environment - providing shade for the cattle, fans and sprinklers to cool down - in spite of all those things, we cannot completely get rid of heat stress because the climate is getting very hot,"" Dr Chauhan said.

""So it is all about minimising that impact.""

At 8.50am, another person urged CPT Tan to evacuate CFC Lee without further delay, but CPT Tan responded that they should wait for another five minutes.","lee, unable, nsf, evacuate, cfc, medical, cpt, heng, tan, rejected, stroke, officer, lees, injury, dave, died, heat, suggestions",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"SINGAPORE: The supervising officer of an 8km fast march for national service trainees repeatedly turned down suggestions to immediately evacuate national serviceman Dave Lee Han Xuan, who was unable to walk properly and was drooling at the end of the march.

The details of the incident, as well as the supervising officer's multiple breaches of protocol, came to light on Wednesday (Jan 13) at the opening of a coroner's inquiry into CFC Lee's death.

According to an investigation report by the police, Captain Tan Baoshu assessed that Corporal First Class (CFC) Lee was suffering from physical exertion rather than heat injury and rejected a suggestion to evacuate him to the medical centre, asking them to wait.

He also rejected a suggestion to administer an intravenous drip on CFC Lee, who was disoriented, unable to swallow liquids and breathing heavily.

CFC Lee was evacuated only 40 minutes later, which a medical expert testified was ""really too long"", and later died of heat stroke with multiple organ failure, aged 19.

The court heard that CFC Lee had started the march along with the other servicemen at 6.45am on Apr 18, 2018. He appeared well and could talk to his superiors in the last few kilometres.

During the final two kilometres, he informed a First Sergeant that he had a cramp in his calf and was allowed to stop to stretch. He continued to take breaks in the course of the final stretch.

CPT Tan, the officer commanding of Support Company, 1st Guards Battalion and the supervising officer of the march, joined CFC Lee in the last 300m of the march.

CFC Lee crossed the finish line at 8.25am, within the required 84 minutes after accounting for the mandatory rest period, and dropped to his knees.

FELL TO HIS KNEES AT COMPLETION OF MARCH

He had his timing recorded and was helped to a rest area, but was swaying as he walked there and his speech was slurred, the court heard.

He was observed to be incoherent, unresponsive, drooling from the mouth and breathing heavily. His equipment was removed and his uniform unbuttoned. On CPT Tan's instruction, ice packs were applied on his neck, armpits and groin and water poured on his face.

CFC Lee was also sprayed with water from a mobile cooling unit, but he was unable to swallow isotonic water administered to him, with the liquid flowing out from his mouth.

CPT Tan observed that CFC Lee was disoriented, unresponsive, breathing heavily and unable to follow instructions. However, he assessed that he was suffering from physical exertion rather than heat injury.

When someone suggested to evacuate him to the medical centre, CPT Tan told him to wait as CFC Lee was suffering from physical exertion and would recover. He failed to order CFC Lee's immediate evacuation, breaking protocol that states soldiers suspected to be suffering from heat injury should be immediately evacuated.

CPT Tan also rejected another suggestion to administer an intravenous drip, which is also stipulated in guidelines for unconscious casualties or those who are unable to drink water.

HE DIRECTED THAT CFC LEE BE COVERED WITH GROUND SHEET

Instead, CPT Tan directed that CFC Lee should be covered with ground sheets, as his arm felt cold. He was covered from the neck down with the ground sheet, and later from the pelvis down.

Fifteen minutes after CFC Lee first collapsed, CPT Tan gave his approval to dismiss the safety vehicle, saying that CFC Lee could be evacuated via a stretcher. He did not check CFC Lee's condition before doing so.

The dismissal of the safety vehicle was contrary to guidelines for the fast march, which stipulate that the vehicle must remain on site for responsive evacuation.

At about 8.45am, an off-duty medic who was walking past the parade square came across CFC Lee and attended to him. He assessed him and told CPT Tan that he should be evacuated to the medical centre immediately.

CPT Tan told him that they should wait for another five to 10 minutes to see if his condition improved. The medic applied an oxygen mask to CFC Lee, as he was wheezing.

At 8.50am, another person urged CPT Tan to evacuate CFC Lee without further delay, but CPT Tan responded that they should wait for another five minutes.

CFC Lee was finally placed on a stretcher at about 9am and taken by foot to the medical centre, arriving at 9.05am. His temperature had not been taken at any time between his collapse and his arrival at the medical centre.

ARRIVAL AT MEDICAL CENTRE

He had a temperature of about 42 degrees Celsius at the centre and was attended to by three doctors who treated him with two cycles of a body cooling unit and applied ice packs.

Despite the treatment, CFC Lee's temperature remained at 42 degrees Celsius and when he started to foam at the mouth, he was evacuated to Changi General Hospital.

He arrived there at about 9.50am with a temperature of 41.6 degrees Celsius. He was intubated and treated with two pints of ice-cold IV drips, but found to have organ damage from heat stroke.

He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but his condition continued to deteriorate, and he later showed brain dysfunctions and his prognosis was subsequently deemed terminal and irreversible with likely brain damage.

He was pronounced dead on Apr 30, a few weeks after the march, with the cause of death being multiple organ failure from heat stroke. The police said in their report read out in court that they do not suspect any foul play in the death of CFC Lee.

The delay of his evacuation was a contributing factor to his death, said the police.

After the incident, six SAF servicemen were fined by a military court over the case. CPT Tan was charged in the State Courts in October 2018 for causing CFC Lee's death by a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide.

However, CPT Tan was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in early February last year. A spokesperson for the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said CPT Tan had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. He died a few weeks later in February 2020, aged 31.

Medical expert Kenneth Heng from the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, who was hired to provide an independent expert opinion on the case, testified that the first aid rendered to CFC Lee at the scene could have been improved.

He could have been moved to a shady area, had his shirt removed completely and fanned to help sweat evaporation, said Dr Heng. An IV drip could have been administered, and covering him with a ground sheet was ""counter-productive"" as he would not have been able to sweat.

EXPERT EXPLAINS HEAT STROKE

Explaining heat stroke, Dr Heng said it is the most severe heat stress of all with temperatures elevated beyond 40 degrees Celsius and mental or neurological deficits.

CFC Lee had been subject to physical exertion from the fast march and demonstrated neurological problems such as drooling, disorientation and slurring of speech, said Dr Heng.

His elevated temperature was due to heat produced by his muscles during the march, with the environment, humidity and temperature contributing to this. He was not able to lose enough heat to keep up with his heat generation.

""Heat stroke leads to multi-organ failure,"" explained Dr Heng. ""There are three main mechanisms. First - direct damage to the cells because of heat - the cells of every organ are affected. Second - because of dehydration and low blood pressure, blood to organs ... is also affected. The final thing is that because of cell damage, there's toxins released, and this causes an inflammatory cascade. So it's a vicious cycle that worsens multi-organ failure.""

Dr Heng said the priority in heat stroke is to reduce temperatures as quickly as possible. Guidelines state that it should be reduced to below 39 degrees Celsius within 30 minutes.

""There's limited things you can do at the scene, so evacuation to a medical centre with a body cooling unit should be the priority,"" he said. ""It was 40 minutes to evacuate (CFC Lee), which was really too long.""

He said a 10 to 15-minute delay would have been reasonable. He was unable to comment on CFC Lee's ""survivability in terms of delay"", but said research has shown that if blood pressure is corrected, mortality decreases from 33 per cent to about 10 per cent.

Responding to the coroner's questions, Dr Heng said there did not seem to be anything in CFC Lee's medical records that would have predisposed him to this sort of injury.

Other circumstances that could have contributed to the heat stroke include CFC Lee's exertion the night before as well as his reduced rest. The night before, instead of having seven hours of rest as required, CFC Lee and his fellow servicemen were punished for various infractions and made to do activities including bear crawls, sprints and push-ups without the knowledge or sanction of supervisors.

However, Dr Heng said CFC Lee did not appear to be sick before the march and was not on any medication. He said it is difficult to identify any precursor symptoms that might have identified the condition, adding that the cramp CFC Lee suffered was fairly non-specific.

The coroner said she would consider the evidence and deliver her findings on Jan 27.

SUBSEQUENT STEPS TO IMPROVE HEAT INJURY MANAGEMENT

In the wake of CFC Lee's death, a Committee of Inquiry was convened to investigate the incident, and several recommendations were proposed to minimise recurrences.

These include reinforcing heat injury management, highlighting to commanders the need to adhere to regulations and guidelines and strengthening the decision-making process on evacuation.

An external review panel commissioned by the Ministry of Defence in May 2018 found that SAF's heat management measures were generally sound and aligned with prevailing industry practices.

The panel suggested several additional measures such as fine-tuning the work-rest cycle, improving heat injury awareness and addressing impediments to self-reporting that might discourage soldiers from speaking up when they feel unwell.

The panel also emphasised that early recognition of heat injuries was the most important of their recommendations, and said all have key roles to play in recognising signs and symptoms in fellow soldiers.

First aid should be rendered and casualties evacuated as soon as possible, with commanders and medics erring on the side of caution as it is difficult to accurately determine the degree of heat injury. When in doubt, all suspected heat injury cases should be transferred to a medical facility, said the panel."

Researchers have found a new way to identify heat-stressed corals.

The work could help scientists pinpoint the coral species that need protection from warming ocean waters linked to climate change.

“This is similar to a blood test to assess human health,” says senior author Debashish Bhattacharya, a professor in the biochemistry and microbiology department in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University–New Brunswick.

“We can assess coral health by measuring the metabolites (chemicals created for metabolism) they produce and, ultimately, identify the best interventions to ensure reef health.

“Coral bleaching from warming waters is an ongoing worldwide ecological disaster. Therefore, we need to develop sensitive diagnostic indicators that can be used to monitor reef health before the visible onset of bleaching to allow time for preemptive conservation efforts.”

Coral reefs provide habitat, nursery, and spawning grounds for fish, food for about 500 million people along with their livelihoods, and coastline protection from storms and erosion.

But global climate change warms ocean waters and threatens corals, resulting in coral bleaching and disease. Other threats to corals include sea-level rise, a more acidic ocean, unsustainable fishing, damage from vessels, invasive species, marine debris, and tropical cyclones, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The new study in Science Advances examined how Hawaiian stony corals respond to heat stress, with a goal of identifying chemical (metabolite) indicators of stress. Heat stress can lead to the loss of algae that live in symbiosis with corals, resulting in a white appearance (bleaching) and, potentially, the loss of reefs.

Scientists subjected the heat-resistant Montipora capitata and heat-sensitive Pocillopora acuta coral species to several weeks of warm seawater in tanks at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology. Then they analyzed the metabolites produced and compared them with other corals not subjected to heat stress.

“Our work, for the first time, identified a variety of novel and known metabolites that may be used as diagnostic indicators for heat stress in wild coral before or in the early stages of bleaching,” Bhattacharya says.

The scientists are validating their coral diagnosis results in a much larger study and the results look promising. The scientists are also developing a “coral hospital” featuring a new lab-on-a-chip device, which could check coral health in the field via metabolite and protein indicators.

This story was produced in collaboration with the Center for Public Integrity and Columbia Journalism Investigations. It was co-published in partnership with Mother Jones, The Arizona Republic and Orlando Sentinel. Regional stories based on the heat illness data analysis produced by CJI can be found in Orlando Sentinel and The Arizona Republic.

Mario Wilcox won’t set out in the summer without an emergency kit in his car trunk: a cooler with an ice pack and a blanket. He learned this improvised life saver from his time in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; ice and a wet cloth can cool down an overheated body. Now he finds it vital in the intensifying heat of Fort Pierce, Florida, and especially his heat-stressed neighborhood.

More than 2,000 miles away in Phoenix, Arizona, Grace Salinas monitors the street outside her window in a public housing complex when summer temperatures reach triple digits. A community leader in the area southwest of downtown, Salinas stocks cold water bottles for anyone she sees struggling with the heat, a situation growing more common each year.

Heat-related illnesses are soaring in Arizona and Florida as the planet warms and temperatures rise. Among the hottest states in the country, none saw a sharper spike in summertime temperatures over the last century than these two. Already, Arizona is considered the hottest state in the U.S., and Phoenix the hottest city, with more than 140 days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit last year alone. In Florida, the combination of heat and humidity makes it one of the nation’s most dangerous places, according to a recent study.

Poor communities are bearing the brunt of sickening heat in these states, an analysis by Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity found. Federal data capturing most emergency room visits and hospitalizations in Arizona and Florida reveal higher rates of heat-related illnesses in areas with less income. The data, never before made public at the ZIP code level, also show that the highest rates of heat-related illnesses are in neighborhoods with a history of racial segregation. Experts say racist policies of the past created conditions, never corrected, that make heat more dangerous for people there today.

Winter has arrived in Arizona and Florida, attracting northerners eager to escape the cold. It seems easy to forget scorching temperatures now. But the warming planet will continue to make summers hotter and more deadly. And that means the problem requires attention year round.

“You would never decide not to heat your home because it is only useful in the winter,” said Howard Frumkin of the University of Washington School of Public Health, who headed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s climate program in the mid-2000s. Likewise, the best solutions for extreme heat — planting more trees, creating buddy systems — must be implemented consistently to be effective. If “efforts lag for months at a time,” he said, “then you lose ground.”

The response to the problem in these hotspots is as disparate as the landscape itself. In the desert city of Phoenix, grassroots groups are partnering with government officials to protect low-income Black and Latino residents from the scorching sun, but targeted and long-term solutions have yet to come. In the beachfront city of Fort Pierce, by contrast, local authorities barely recognize the threat of heat and are doing little to nothing about it.

Adrienne Hollis, a researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists, studies the effects of the changing climate on the health of historically disadvantaged populations. She notes that communities of color are often the hardest hit by extreme heat. According to her calculations, U.S. counties where African Americans or Latinos represent at least a quarter of the population — most in the South — have faced more days with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit over a three-decade period: an average of 18 and 13 days per year, respectively, as compared with roughly seven days a year for the rest of the country.

“ZIP codes do determine your health,” Hollis said, “and most of that is because of structural racism.”

Arizona’s 85007 ZIP code, which includes both the predominantly low-income Black and Latino area southwest of downtown and the more affluent, white neighborhood of Encanto Park, had in 2017 the highest rate of heat-related illness in that state. CJI’s analysis of the federal data shows per-capita ER visits and hospitalizations linked to problems such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion and dehydration in this 4.5-square-mile area were nearly 10 times the state’s average. In Florida’s 34950 ZIP code, the majority Black and low-income neighborhood of Lincoln Park where Wilcox lives, residents came to hospitals for these ailments nearly six times more often than the statewide average.

The situation in both places has been getting worse, county health data shows. In and around southwest of downtown Phoenix, the yearly number of heat-related ER visits for every 100,000 people has more than doubled since 2010, to 129. In Saint Lucie County, where Lincoln Park is located, the rate of such visits in recent years is almost double its mid-2000s level, while hospitalization rates in the same period have more than tripled.

Emergency calls to 911 in both places reveal the risks faced by residents during the summer and even well into the fall. Elderly people, overcome by heat, collapsed and injured themselves while walking outside. Heat exhaustion hit young adults as they biked or waited for a bus. Potentially deadly heat strokes snuck up on workers laboring in the sun.

Salinas, 70, who grew up in Phoenix’s 85007 ZIP code, is used to seeing people succumb to the baking sun. She lost a cousin who lived in the neighborhood to heat stroke and witnessed her adult son, sprawled on the ground outside her home, go to the ER for the same reason. She knows how to identify the danger signs. ""We see people walking by looking like they need to breathe,"" she said. “If you’re not sweating anymore, you’re already in trouble.” During the summer, the tenant leader also checks on elderly people living in her public-housing complex, built in the 1940s to house Mexican Americans. She gives people tips on using the air conditioner in more economical ways.

That may sound like a constant battle. And it is.

“It’s just the way of life here,” Salinas said.

Unequal heat

What’s driving this problem is inequality. Salinas lives in an area largely populated by squat houses with dusty yards that rivals the hottest spots in Phoenix. Daytime temperatures here can be between four and seven degrees Fahrenheit higher than in the wealthier Encanto, located partly in the 85007 ZIP code just three miles north, according to separate experiments conducted by Arizona State University and The Arizona Republic.

While Encanto is an oasis full of parks, replete with trees that keep the air cooler, the area southwest of downtown, between West Harrison Street and the Maricopa Freeway, is marked by barren lots and heat-trapping cement. Mirage-like desert mountains on the horizon break up the urban landscape of highways, buildings and fences here. To make things worse, this area is one of the poorest in town, with residents who often can’t afford to run an air conditioner. Electricity bills can cost around $600 a month per family.

It’s a dangerous combination.

“That’s where the inequities show,” said Juan Barreto-Declet, a geographer researching environmental vulnerability to heat in Phoenix. “That is where the vulnerability is higher.”

And those inequities appear to be widening. State health data shows heat illnesses in this neighborhood and across central Phoenix have increased at a rate seven times the rest of the city since 2010. In Encanto, by contrast, the annual rate of heat illnesses has dipped.

CJI’s analysis shows 79 people who live in the 85007 ZIP code went to the hospital in 2017 because of life-threatening symptoms brought on by heat. Around half suffered from heat exhaustion, while another 20% succumbed to the more severe condition of heat stroke.

The risks facing residents in this area didn’t happen by chance. Investments here — in trees, parks, transit — have been historically lower than in higher-income areas of the city.

That history dates back at least as far as government-imposed “redlining” of the 1930s. The federal Home Owners’ Loan Corp. mapped neighborhoods in cities across the country and graded them according to perceived risk of lending there — with race as the key factor. Areas with people of color and immigrants were marked in red and judged high-risk for mortgage lenders, starving neighborhoods of investment.

The government’s red pen came for the south and west sides of Phoenix, among the city’s oldest regions and historically inhabited by Blacks, Mexican immigrants and Native Americans. Local decisions reinforced residential segregation: Zoning regulations forbade industrial land use in white neighborhoods, funneling that development and its pollution to places where people of color lived; race-restrictive covenants prevented anyone who wasn’t white from buying houses in affluent suburbs.

These policies resulted in “relegating minorities and low-income populations to the hottest areas of the city,” Barreto-Declet said.

A similar storyline has unfolded in many other places across the country — including Florida’s heat-illnesses hotspot, Lincoln Park in Fort Pierce.

The area’s first Black people were enslaved, brought by white settlers on the hunt for land along the Atlantic Coast in 1842. More African Americans moved to the region after the Civil War to work on pineapple farms and then railroads.

The Jim Crow era hardened this segregation. Lincoln Park residents couldn’t go to the same school or beach as white people. Celebrated writer Zora Neale Hurston, who spent her last years in the neighborhood, was buried in an all-Black cemetery, her grave unmarked for a dozen years. The now-shuttered African American-owned theater — one of just four in the country — stands on the main thoroughfare here, Avenue D. U.S. 1 was the literal dividing line: the “Colored Town” on one side, and on the other, the “White City.”

“Segregation in the county determined where a Black citizen could live, work, go to school, fish, eat, give birth, go to church, pee, walk and be buried,” said Jean Ellen Wilson, an 80-year-old historian who grew up in the white part of town. “Black people were not allowed to come out to White City.”

Today, most of the city’s Black residents still live in Lincoln Park, which remains “Fort Pierce’s most segregated community,” a 2016 city housing report states. The neighborhood is 91% African American, and a little more than half the residents live below the federal poverty line. In a county where the typical household makes about $43,000, the median income here is just $15,797. One aid agency fields 300 or so monthly requests from local residents seeking help to pay their electricity bills.

Wilcox sees the stark difference between his neighborhood and the rest of the city when driving in the area. Heading south on Indian River Drive, toward the Fort Pierce immortalized in paintings of exuberant sunrises and palm-lined beaches, he takes in solar panels, fountains, expensive houses. On the return trip north, he spots weathered homes and stores, their pastel colors faded, their windows boarded or covered in aluminum foil — a sign of no air conditioning or insulation. On a hot day, families keep doors open and sit outside to cool off. Friends play dominoes or catch ball on street corners. As he sees it, a systematic lack of resources explains why people here are sickened by heat.

“The south and the beachfront are the haves,” he said. “And the north of the city is the haves not.”

CJI’s data analysis shows that 33 people living in the ZIP code encompassing most of Lincoln Park went to the hospital for heat-related illnesses in 2017. Sixty percent were Black. That’s a lot of people for a small area of about 16,000 residents.

The legacy of racist policies on present-day heat vulnerability is widespread across the country. A study conducted by researchers at the Science Museum of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University and Portland State University looked at more than 108 cities to conclude that the hottest neighborhoods are those located in formerly redlined areas. Unpublished data from this research, calculated exclusively for CJI, shows that in Phoenix, for example, the current difference in temperature between redlined areas and other neighborhoods is more than eight degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.

In the city’s 85007 ZIP code, home to several shelters, people identified as homeless account for some of the patients sickened by heat. But even when this population is excluded from the data, the ZIP code remains the state’s hardest hit. And Black people are disproportionately represented among the heat-illness patients, CJI’s analysis shows: They’re three times more likely to go to the ER for that reason.

CJI analyzed statewide data in Arizona and Florida to see whether the ZIP codes with the highest heat-illness rates were also the hottest, but the results were inconclusive. Heat maps show Fort Pierce’s Lincoln Park and neighborhoods southwest of downtown Phoenix have elevated temperatures, but other similarly hot areas have experienced fewer heat illnesses. That suggests temperature isn’t the only reason so many people are sickened by heat in these neighborhoods.

Underlying health conditions that exacerbate heat illness may play a role. In both ZIPs, CJI’s analysis of hospital data found high numbers of patients diagnosed with conditions known to heighten risk for heat stress — diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. In Lincoln Park, nearly half of the 2017 heat-illness patients were also diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. This too can be a consequence of decades of decisions that sapped neighborhood resources.

One 2017 community assessment found the diabetes rate is three times higher in Lincoln Park than in the rest of the county, a spike that its health department has worked to reduce. Most health experts recognize the link between poverty, chronic conditions and heat, but it doesn’t seem to be on county health officials’ radar.

Clint Sperber, who heads the Saint Lucie County Department of Health, declined to be interviewed for this article. In an email, he acknowledged that the agency wasn’t aware of the heat issue until a CJI reporter reached out. The agency had no answer about why it had not already made use of the data on heat illnesses that the Florida Department of Health collects so its county counterparts can develop public health interventions.

“The Department of Health in St. Lucie and our community partners have been informed, and as a community we will collaborate to address this issue,” Sperber wrote in a November 12 email.

The agency has taken the problem to the Fort Pierce city manager, he said. A spokesperson for that official, Nick Mimms, said in an email that the city is “looking forward … to collect as much data and information as possible in order to combat the heat illness and create a program that provides safety and protects the well-being of its citizens.” Mimms declined an interview request.

Gerald Newberry, 59, was born and raised in Lincoln Park and has always worked outdoors, starting as a teenager when he picked fruit with his father. He lost count of how many times he saw co-workers getting sick in the fields because of the baking sun. On the job, farmworkers with limited access to health care relied on a homemade treatment to beat the heat: a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with water. Now a landscaper, Newberry still carries a vinegar and water bottle with him. Often, he gets dizzy and feels ill under the sun.

“It feels like you did bump your head, it feels sore, and you know that you didn’t bump it,” he said. “And then another thing is the headaches, heavy headaches.”

He has never fainted but fears the day he will, like the locals say, be “bear-caught,” a heat stroke that takes you to the ground like a bear sneaking in from behind. Until he recently got health insurance, sporadic visits to Walgreens to check his blood pressure were his only form of health care.

Too slow or not at all

Cities can mitigate heat risk with steps such as planting trees, investing in new designs and cool materials, and opening cooling centers for residents without air conditioning. None of this has happened in Fort Pierce, the health department said. In one of the city’s few nods to the dangers, it prohibits residents from leaving dogs outside when the heat index is above 100°F. There’s no local law protecting people from heat.

A 2016 report from the county emergency-management division at the Department of Public Safety warned that the “probability of heat indexes within the range of causing health problems is moderate to high during the summer months.” But according to the division, the county has never declared a heat emergency and, unlike hurricanes and floods, the issue is not among its priorities.

County health officials also confirm that they don’t have any programs or policies for extreme heat. In a 2015 report, the Florida health department classified Fort Pierce’s county, Saint Lucie, at medium to high risk for heat hazards under different climate change scenarios. But the state’s actions to prevent heat illnesses are scant. Its “Beat the Heat” campaign is a 26-second video with tips for residents about how to stay safe.

State health officials have long overlooked climate-related health hazards. In 2016, the department shunted its federally funded climate and health program to Florida State University, where it has no policy-making power. The program serves three of the state’s 67 counties. Saint Lucie isn’t one of them.

Former Fort Pierce City Commissioner Reginald Sessions, a native of Lincoln Park who represented the area until December, said he’d like to see more effort by health officials to help Black and poor communities.

“We need to put a lot more emphasis on targeting them to improve their health,” he said. “I assure you that if we do that, we will have less African Americans suffering from heat strokes.”

In Phoenix, where local officials are keenly aware of heat’s dangers, efforts to protect residents are further along. But plans to address the long underinvestment in neighborhoods southwest of downtown have yet to bear fruit.

Efforts to save lives with heat-risk awareness campaigns date back to the summer of 2009, after eight local residents died of heat stroke.

Eva Olivas with the grassroots Phoenix Revitalization Corp. reached out to the city parks and aquatics departments. They organized information sessions at public pools and posted on social media.

“Sometimes people who live here get so used to the heat that they forget how dangerous it can be,” she said. “The idea was to remind them that the summers today are not like summers before.”

Mark Hartman, who heads the city’s Sustainability Office, said Phoenix is trying to be the first municipality to respond to extreme heat like other places prepare for storms. In 2018, he and other city officials launched a “Heat Ready” program that pulled together actions they had already adopted and plan to extend, including emergency relief such as cooling centers and long-term initiatives, like planting trees and using “cooling pavement” that doesn’t absorb as much heat. His office is testing this pavement in different districts across the city, including one location outside the 85007 ZIP code in the area southwest of downtown.

Phoenix has set a goal to cover 25% of its land area with trees by 2030. That would double the tree canopy and require planting 10,000 trees per year on average. But the city is off track: When Phoenix planted a record number of trees in 2019, it still amounted to less than half the annual requirement.

A CJI analysis of satellite data reveals a stark disparity in green space in ZIP code 85007: Forty-two percent of the wealthier Encanto neighborhood has leafy vegetation, including two golf courses. By contrast, just seven percent of the area southwest of downtown Phoenix is green. Residents have pushed city officials for years to plant more trees in vulnerable areas, and a city subcommittee recommended the appointment of a “tree administrator.”

City officials have yet to implement that recommendation. Hartman said the city is trying to map the areas most in danger from heat to target tree distribution and related actions.

“We originally thought that we needed to create shades throughout our whole city and trees everywhere, but actually, we just need them in certain places, like in vulnerable communities,” he said.

In the last three years, his cabinet has worked with researchers like David Hondula, a sustainability scientist at ASU and a member of the state’s climate and health team, to develop a more complete vulnerability index. It aims to take into account not only where the most heat-vulnerable people live, but also where they are most exposed.

“The traditional approaches to vulnerability don’t really reflect how people move around the city,” said Hondula, whose own research has identified ZIP code 85007 among the city’s top 10 neighborhoods most vulnerable to heat.

Advocates, scientists and county health officials have met multiple times with residents of Edison-Eastlake, a neighborhood just east of downtown Phoenix, to hear about problems contributing to heat risk. Among those they named: too few street trees and unshaded bus stops.

This shouldn’t come as news to city officials. A 2004 Phoenix urban design plan recommended the city “provide comfortable and convenient shaded bus stops.” But from her office window today, 16 years later, Olivas sees a bus stop that’s merely a sign in the sun. “Should this kind of ‘infrastructure’ be considered normal in a city where the temperatures get up to 117?” she asks.

That’s just one such example of a missed opportunity. In 2014, the city launched a streets plan that included guidelines for developers on shade and tree coverage. Four years later, seven of the project’s nine advisory board members quit, saying the city, lobbied by developers, was proposing a series of alterations to the street design guidelines that “watered them down” until they were meaningless. The project stalled.

“The city is really good at writing press releases and approving plans,” said Stacey Champion, who participated in a 2018 petition to Phoenix officials about local trees, “but not so good in making sure those plans actually get followed.”

Hartman, acknowledging some problems, blamed a lack of funding and personnel. He said the city still “has a long way” to go to be heat ready.

Mayor Kate Gallego, asked about criticism that the city has prioritized plans over action, declined to comment. Her office pointed to yet another plan: a climate-action strategy it’s developing after joining a network of 96 municipalities worldwide whose leaders have committed to combat global warming. It will include heat mitigation.

“Phoenix is uniquely experienced to share proven practices for building heat resilience,” Gallego said​ in a written statement. “We are still learning and have a lot of work to do, but our partnership with heat research powerhouse Arizona State University and our legacy of living with heat makes Phoenix a model for other cities who are grappling with this public health challenge.”

A hotter future

If officials don’t counteract the longstanding disinvestment that endangers people in communities like Lincoln Park and those southwest of downtown Phoenix, heat risks there will worsen. A report from the Union of Concerned Scientists predicts Florida will experience some of the most frequent periods of extreme heat in the nation by 2050 as climate change intensifies: as many as 105 days a year with a heat index over 100°F. The group expects Fort Pierce and the surrounding county will endure five times more extreme heat days a year than from the 1970s to 2000. In the greater Phoenix area, such days are projected to double.

The UCS’s Hollis, who grew up in hot and segregated Mobile, Alabama, warns that people of color will bear the brunt of this change. By midcentury, if nothing is done to stop climate change, counties where Black residents make up more than a quarter of the population will experience an additional month of extreme heat days each year compared with their counterparts, according to an analysis she conducted.

“If nothing is done,” she said, “we’re gonna have more health disparities, more people sick and more deaths.”

Back in Phoenix, Grace Salinas has tried to keep up her usual heat outreach. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, her block watch association had to abandon its plans for awareness campaigns and other activities. She sent information leaflets to neighbors instead.

The number of 911 heat-related calls in the city last year topped 1,400. In the last six years, those calls have jumped 80 percent.

How heat, wet or dry, affects the body

Extreme heat overwhelms our body’s ability to regulate its temperature by sweating. This can lead to heat stress, which has wide-ranging symptoms like cramps, headaches and nausea. The more severe condition of heat stroke occurs when our body temperature rises to 104 degrees. That can affect the brain and potentially cause fainting or death.

All that can happen in dry heat, but the combination of heat and humidity is worse. That’s because humidity prevents our sweat from evaporating enough to cool down. Scientists assess this combination using what’s known as “wet-bulb temperature.” Even when air temperatures are hovering around 80 degrees, humidity can threaten to overheat our bodies.

Climate scientists predict the heat-humidity combo will hit deadly thresholds as the planet warms. Such scenarios have more than doubled since 1979 across the southern United States, a recent study shows. Researchers found parts of Florida and Louisiana along the Gulf of Mexico have among the deadliest mixtures of hot air temperatures and humidity worldwide.

Children, seniors and people with chronic conditions are most at risk for heat-related illnesses. Those experiencing heat-stress symptoms should find a cool place to rest, hydrate and let someone know they’re not feeling well. If symptoms worsen, cover your body in cold, wet towels or ice packs. This can save lives. And, of course, call 911.

Kutcher expanded on this, concluding that hot days during the first 14 days of flowering had the greatest impact on canola yield.
But research shows that canola has a hard time compensating for heat damage to those first flowers.
After being interviewed for this article, Lindsay compared notes on the summer heat and canola yield with her husband, Trevor.
Both studies suggest that seed companies could improve canola heat tolerance by selecting for the trait from among existing lines.","nights, flowers, flowering, yield, canola, flounder, c, yields, hot, temperatures, heat, days",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Lindsay Wytinck was camping with her family on the 2020 July long weekend and did something she doesn’t usually do — turned on the camper air conditioner so they could sleep.

“That was a first for us,” says the farmer from Cypress River, Man. “The nights were so uncomfortably hot.”

Meanwhile back at the farm, the Wytincks’ earliest canola fields were just coming into flower. Those hot days and warm nights not only made camping uncomfortable, they were also reducing canola yield potential.

The yield-damaging effect of heat has been shown over and over in Canadian canola studies. In a study published in 1992, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) research scientist Wes Nuttall found that canola yields for years at the high end of the normal July-August temperature range were 0.4 tonnes per hectare (approximately seven bu./ac.) lower than yields for years with temperatures at the low end.

In another review 18 years later, Randy Kutcher, then with AAFC, looked at long-term weather data and canola yields, and showed a yield loss of approximately seven per cent for each 1 C increase in average growing-season temperature.

Warm nights compound loss

The conclusion is that warm years have lower yields and cool years have higher yields.

It doesn’t take much heat at flowering to cause yield loss. In plot studies from 1989 to 1991, AAFC research scientist Malcolm Morrison found that yield loss for Brassica napus, B. rapa and B. juncea would start when temperatures during flowering exceeded 29.5 C. More degrees and more hot days compound the loss.

As part of the study, Morrison measured the accumulation of “heat stress units” and found that as the daily maximum temperature increased beyond the 29.5 C threshold and as flowering canola experienced multiple hot days, the yield loss became steadily worse. (See Figure 1 below)

“You give a cool-season crop like canola one day over 30 C at flowering and it’s going to reduce yields,” Morrison says.

Kutcher expanded on this, concluding that hot days during the first 14 days of flowering had the greatest impact on canola yield. He also dug into the combination of hot days and warm nights and found that “high-yield years had lower nocturnal temperatures throughout the growing season, and low-yield years had higher nocturnal temperatures.”

That long weekend in July 2020, while the Wytincks were sweating in their camper, the temperatures could hardly have been worse for their canola. Weather records for Cypress River show highs of 30.5 C on July 3 and 29.7 C on July 4. Nights provided little in the way of relief. Over those two days, the Environment Canada weather station at Cypress River recorded a stretch of 65 hours when the temperature barely dropped below 20 C. (It went to 19.4 C at 8 a.m. on July 4 and was around 19 C for five hours in the early hours of July 5.)

Flowers don’t fertilize

Wytinck says these canola fields “flowered for quite a long time,” which the crop will do to compensate for lost flowers. But research shows that canola has a hard time compensating for heat damage to those first flowers. In a Canadian study published in 2000, Sangu Angadi showed that while extended flowering and podding on side branches could help, it did not come close to making up for lost yield from damage to those first flowers.

Morrison, who has done several canola-and-heat studies over the years, says the plant will block its own fertilization if temperatures are too hot. It produces flower after flower, but won’t fertilize them, which results in blank spaces up the stem. In some cases, pollination will occur without fertilization, so a pod forms but doesn’t have any seeds. These “parthenocarpic” pods are chubby, misshapen and empty. And for a final blow, even when cooler temperatures returned, Morrison observed a few days “lag” time before flowers started to work properly again.

For the Wytincks, canola fields that looked so good earlier in the season didn’t reach their yield goal. After being interviewed for this article, Lindsay compared notes on the summer heat and canola yield with her husband, Trevor. While they don’t recall seeing a lot of missing pods, they did notice pods that were yellow and shrunken — possibly parthenocarpic. “Trevor completely agreed that heat was one factor in lower yields,” Wytinck says.

How to beat the heat?

There are no silver bullets — or bullets of any kind. Management options are more like pebbles for a slingshot.

Seeding early has long been the recommended practice to make sure canola isn’t flowering during the hottest days of the year. This can work to some extent, given that weather averages show that early July is cooler than late July. (See Table 1 below) Seeding any time in the first half of May usually means canola starts to flower around the first week of July.

“But early seeding isn’t always possible,” says Curtis Rempel, CCC vice-president of crop production and innovation. “Seeding early is often impossible due to soil moisture, and seeding early has other challenges — frost risk is higher, and slow growth in cool soils increases the risk from flea beetle damage and seedling diseases.”

The Wytincks’ experience in 2020 shows that early seeding isn’t always the answer. An early-July heatwave hit their earliest-seeded canola and a late-July heatwave hit their later-seeded fields. (This is demonstrated in Table 1.) Temperatures around Cypress River cooled off a little after the first week of July but then ramped up again later in the month when a lot of later-seeded canola was in flower. In fact, the hottest night of the year at Cypress River was 21.9 C on July 24. That same temperature cycle was repeated across the province and many other parts of the Prairies. Canola couldn’t dodge the heat no matter the seeding date.

Boron application on flowers has been tried as a treatment, but results are more miss than hit. A four-year study in Ontario looked at boron (0.3 lb./ac.) applied to flowering canola, and the only economic response came on the hottest year. This provided some positive evidence for the practice, but when now-retired Alberta Agriculture oilseed specialist Murray Hartman did a meta-analysis of boron studies, his results showed no relationship between boron response and temperature — even when temperatures were hot at flowering.

Genetic solution?

One pebble that could be chipped into an arrowhead is genetically superior heat tolerance in canola cultivars. Malcolm Morrison showed considerable genetic differences in a growth-chamber comparison of 47 cultivars from 2011 to 2013. Chad Koscielny, in his University of Manitoba PhD thesis, also showed differences in heat tolerance among hybrid parent lines. Both studies suggest that seed companies could improve canola heat tolerance by selecting for the trait from among existing lines.

The challenge for seed companies is that this adds yet another selection parameter into what is already a long list of demands. But perhaps for regions like southern Manitoba that tend to have hotter nights, identifying those hybrids with advanced heat tolerance could go a long way to improving yields. Another possible genetics-related option is to choose earlier-maturing hybrids, which also tend to flower earlier, as a way to dodge the hottest days of July.

Curtis Rempel says farmers could use results from Canola Performance Trials (canolaperformancetrials.ca) to see how hybrids performed with weather in their regions. “By looking at weather records and comparing that to hybrid yield performance, we can use CPTs to tease out which hybrids have increased heat tolerance.”

The bottom line is that while canola genetics have improved a lot over the years, Brassica napus is still a cool-season crop that gets hammered by hot temperatures at flowering. Heat will be one reason why yields in 2020 were lower than people expected.

“And while various factors contribute to yield loss in any given year, a long-term warming trend for July nights may also partly explain why canola yields in Western Canada are not increasing as fast as people might expect,” Rempel says. (See Figures 2 and 3 below)

When asked if it’s possible we’re not fully accounting for the yield loss from hot days and warm nights, Malcolm Morrison gave a one-word answer: “Certainly.”

Who is most at risk?

One study compared workers’ compensation claims in Adelaide from 2003 to 2013. It found workers at higher risk during extremely hot temperatures included:

animal and horticultural workers

cleaners

food service workers

metal workers

warehouse workers.

The authors noted hot weather “poses a greater problem than cold weather. This is of particular concern as the number of hot days is projected to increase”.

Another study involving many of the same researchers looked at the impact of heatwaves on work-related injuries and illnesses in Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. It found vulnerable groups included:

males

workers aged under 34 years

apprentice/trainee workers

labour hire workers

those employed in medium and heavy strength occupations, and

workers from outdoor and indoor industrial sectors.

A study of work-related injuries in Melbourne between 2002 and 2012 found

Young workers, male workers and workers engaged in heavy physical work are at increased risk of injury on hot days, and a wider range of worker subgroups are vulnerable to injury following a warm night. In light of climate change projections, this information is important for informing injury prevention strategies.

A study using data for Adelaide between 2001 and 2010 concluded male workers and young workers aged under 24 were at high risk of work-related injuries in hot environments. The link between temperature and daily injury claims was strong for labourers, tradespeople and intermediate production and transport workers (who do jobs such as operating plant, machinery, vehicles and other equipment to transport passengers and goods).

Industries with greater risk were agriculture, forestry and fishing, construction, as well as electricity, gas and water.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies on the links between heat exposure and occupational injuries found

Young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and workers in agriculture, forestry or fishing, construction and manufacturing industries were at high risk of occupational injuries during hot temperatures. Further young workers (age < 35 years), male workers and those working in electricity, gas and water and manufacturing industries were found to be at high risk of occupational injuries during heatwaves.

The fact that apprentices or trainees had greater heat-related injuries in the workplace may surprise many, as heat tolerance deteriorates with age. Exposure to labour intensive work, less experience in managing heat stress, and a propensity to avoid acknowledging they’re affected by heat may contribute to the higher risk for younger workers.

Other factors that increase risk

A growing body of international research shows extreme heat can cause severe health issues.

Other factors that increase vulnerability to heat include age (especially being older or very young), low-socioeconomic status, and homelessness. Regions also matter; there are differences between climate zones and increased heat-related morbidity in rural settings.

Underlying health conditions increase the risk of heat-related illness and death. These health conditions include

diabetes

high blood pressure

chronic kidney disease

heart conditions and

respiratory conditions.

Chronic heat exposure is dangerous and has been linked to serious health problems, including chronic and irreversible kidney injury. A range of studies have linked higher temperatures with increases in suicide rates, emergency department visits for mental illness, and poor mental health.

We need to better understand the problem

Most of the studies mentioned here focused on worker’s compensation claims. That data includes only those injuries for which compensation claims were actually made. In reality, the problem is likely more widespread.

The Australian studies primarily focused on the milder climatic regions of Australia, but the rate of injuries and ill health is greater in hot and humid regions. And the dangers may be worse in regional and remote areas, particularly when and where workforces are transient.

We also need more research on the relationship between the length of exposure to higher temperatures (in hours or days) and worker health.

National studies or studies in other regions should assess whether rates of injury differ by occupation, climate zone and remoteness. Capturing data on all types and severity of workplace injuries (not just those that led to a compensation claim) is crucial to understanding the true extent of the problem.

As the climate changes and heatwaves become more frequent and severe, it’s vital we do more to understand who is most vulnerable and how we can reduce their risk.

Coral reefs provide an essential environment for fish, which serve as food and a source of income for about 500 million people.

The research could help to prevent the loss of reefs, which are an essential part of the ocean's ecosystem.

Researchers have found a new way to identify heat-stressed corals.

The work could help scientists pinpoint the coral species that need protection from warming ocean waters linked to climate change.

“This is similar to a blood test to assess human health,” says senior author Debashish Bhattacharya, a professor in the biochemistry and microbiology department in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University–New Brunswick.

“We can assess coral health by measuring the metabolites (chemicals created for metabolism) they produce and, ultimately, identify the best interventions to ensure reef health.

“Coral bleaching from warming waters is an ongoing worldwide ecological disaster. Therefore, we need to develop sensitive diagnostic indicators that can be used to monitor reef health before the visible onset of bleaching to allow time for preemptive conservation efforts.”

Coral reefs provide habitat, nursery, and spawning grounds for fish, food for about 500 million people along with their livelihoods, and coastline protection from storms and erosion.

But global climate change warms ocean waters and threatens corals, resulting in coral bleaching and disease. Other threats to corals include sea-level rise, a more acidic ocean, unsustainable fishing, damage from vessels, invasive species, marine debris, and tropical cyclones, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The new study in Science Advances examined how Hawaiian stony corals respond to heat stress, with a goal of identifying chemical (metabolite) indicators of stress. Heat stress can lead to the loss of algae that live in symbiosis with corals, resulting in a white appearance (bleaching) and, potentially, the loss of reefs.

Scientists subjected the heat-resistant Montipora capitata and heat-sensitive Pocillopora acuta coral species to several weeks of warm seawater in tanks at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology. Then they analyzed the metabolites produced and compared them with other corals not subjected to heat stress.

“Our work, for the first time, identified a variety of novel and known metabolites that may be used as diagnostic indicators for heat stress in wild coral before or in the early stages of bleaching,” Bhattacharya says.

The scientists are validating their coral diagnosis results in a much larger study and the results look promising. The scientists are also developing a “coral hospital” featuring a new lab-on-a-chip device, which could check coral health in the field via metabolite and protein indicators."

Corals get a double-whammy negative from heat – those that are bleached as a result of heat stress also become less resilient to ocean acidification.

Robert Eagle at the University of California, Los Angeles and his colleagues have analysed the effect of elevated temperatures on the growth of two species of stony coral when the corals are also exposed to ocean acidification.

The acidification of oceans occurs as result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere being absorbed by seawater. The results are a decrease in the pH of the water, a decrease in its concentration of carbonate ions and a drop in the saturation states of calcium carbonate minerals.

Both carbonate ions and calcium carbonate minerals are essential for forming coral skeletons, and a drop in the saturation states of calcium carbonate minerals makes it more likely for the skeletons to start to dissolve. The pH of surface ocean waters has decreased by 0.1 units since the beginning of the industrial revolution.

To test the resilience of corals to acidification, the researchers exposed samples of cauliflower coral, Pocillopora damicornis, and hood coral, Stylophora pistillata, to different partial pressures of carbon dioxide at both 28° C, a near-optimal temperature, and 31°C, an elevated temperature.

Read more: Inside the fight to save the Great Barrier Reef from climate change

Eagle and his team used two methods to measure the corals’ pH. Firstly, they used robotically controlled microelectrodes that were inserted directly into coral tissues to measure the pH in fluid pockets from which the coral skeleton grows. They also indirectly measured the pH using a boron-isotoping method.

The team found that both species of coral coped with ocean acidification conditions at 28°C. To compensate, the corals elevated their internal pH and also altered their internal chemistry to promote calcification, the process by which corals form their skeletons.

When in 31°C waters – enough heat stress that it caused the corals to bleach – the rates of calcification decreased for both coral species.

A better understanding of how different stressors interact is important for coral conservation, according to Eagle. “Conservation is not just about temperature, even though that is clearly the most important problem,” he says. “The scale of the effort that it would take for human intervention to preserve and restore these environments is clearly a huge effort.”

It comes as the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement, released today, shows 2020 was Australia’s fourth-warmest year on record, despite being an “La Niña” year, which usually leads to cooler temperatures.

Cities occupy just 3% of Earth’s surface. As this portion of land is so small, they’ve typically been left out of most climate models, which generally make projections on global scales.

Yet more than half the world’s population live in urban environments (set to jump to 70% by 2050). This is why the researchers call for “multi-model projections” of local climates for cities.

In the study, the researchers say their predictions on climate will give “urban planners and decision-makers in any city […] access to city-specific projections for any planning horizon they need”.

It’s important these planning horizons include the cooling and shading provided by green infrastructure — the network of green spaces such as street trees and green walls — in urban areas.

Read more: Here’s how green infrastructure can easily be added to the urban planning toolkit

For Australia, this means getting a national green infrastructure policy that provides for green spaces within our cities, open spaces and buildings to help with increasing density and rising global temperatures.

What the research found

Heat events, such as heatwaves, pose a significant health risk and can hit people harder in cities.

Cities are hotter than in surrounding regional areas due to “the urban heat island” effect, a result of heat created by all the densely packed people, vehicles and industries, and the heat retained among buildings and other infrastructure.

Despite having the highest population density, the researchers point out that urban areas aren’t often represented in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. This project is important because it informs the global authority on climate change (the International Panel on Climate Change).

So the research authors built a statistical model emulating a complex climate model with urban regions. And they estimate that, by the end of the century, average warming across global cities will increase by 1.9℃ under an intermediate emissions scenario, and 4.4℃ with high emissions.

Urban warming would most affect mid-to-northern parts of the United States, southern Canada, Europe, the Middle East, northern Central Asia and northwestern China.

Read more: Smart urban design could save lives in future heatwaves

They also predict that the heat index would increase faster than air temperature alone over almost all cities. “Heat index” refers to how hot the human body actually feels, a combination of relative humidity and air temperature. This would mean urban residents would experience higher heat stress.

What does this mean for Australia?

While the research found most urban warming would occur in the northern hemisphere, Australian cities are also projected to continue to warm. But we need only look to the recent record-breaking years to realise climate change will result in more extremely hot days here.

2019 was Australia’s hottest (and driest) year on record. And today’s annual climate statement from the Bureau of Meteorology shows the highest temperature ever recorded in the Sydney Basin, at a whopping 48.9℃, occurred in 2020, on January 4. It also found the average national temperature for 2020 was 1.15℃ higher than normal.

These are nationwide findings, but how Australia manages climate in urban areas is particularly important as around 80% of population growth occurs in capital cities.

In fact, 2020 research found we’re increasingly facing more frequent and prolonged heatwaves that intensify urban heat islands in places such as Sydney, by raising inland temperatures by as much as 10℃ more than in coastal zones.

Keeping cities cool

The best way to ensure our cities are kept cool is through greening urban spaces. Green spaces can be developed by planting trees in streets, yards and parks for shade, recreation and relief from the heat. This will create cooler urban “microclimates” for social interaction and natural retreats from city life.

Read more: The world endured 2 extra heatwave days per decade since 1950 – but the worst is yet to come

Greater Sydney, for example, has a welcome new policy to ensure five million more trees are planted by 2030. This is an important long-term goal as 2016 research from Canada found tree cover in daytime reduced air temperature by up to 4℃ in Montreal city.

The design of buildings and their immediate surroundings are also important to help manage increasing heat in our cities.

Our open spaces are places of exercise, retreat, relaxation and, in a new COVID world, socially distant interactions. The pandemic has allowed us to rediscover the importance of our community and local connections in these spaces.

Multi-storey buildings also provide opportunity for vertical greening. The Victorian government, for example, is seeking to increase the amount of green infrastructure in our urban areas to help us cope with predicted warmer conditions.

Australia needs a national planning policy

Urban planning and greening urban spaces is largely a local government responsibility, usually overseen by state and territory governments.

And there is national recognition of the importance of green cities through the federal government’s Smart Cities Plan. It states:

Green, sustainable cities […] improve the quality of air and water, reduce the heat island effect, protect biological diversity and threatened species, and enhance general amenity.

But what’s needed, urgently, is a national planning framework of green city principles so no regions get left behind. Climate change is a national issue, and all urban residents from all socioeconomic backgrounds should benefit from green cities.

This national planning policy would describe how our cities across the nation should develop appropriately spaced trees and other vegetation, to better manage and prepare for increasing density and greater activity as climate change brings hotter weather.

And importantly, more research is needed to better inform climate models. We need more information into the ways our climates will change within different land areas — whether rural, suburban or in cities — so we can develop better national plans for how we will live and work in the future.

“Our research suggests that as the climate warms, grizzly bears can avoid heat stress through behaviors such as ‘bath-taking,’ and thus access to cool water will likely become increasingly important,” Long said.","female, cooling, avoid, water, climate, lactating, bears, important, baths, activity, stress, help, cool, heat, grizzly",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"MOSCOW, Idaho — Jan. 13, 2021— Taking a bath to relieve stress isn’t unique to humans.

Bears do it too, and although they appear to enjoy taking a dip, it likely functions to help them cool down.

A recent study led by University of Idaho graduate student Savannah Rogers and Associate Professor of Wildlife Sciences Ryan Long shows that grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park take “baths” in cool water to help prevent overheating.

Because the body temperature of mammals rises during lactation, bath-taking by female grizzly bears in the park may help facilitate increased milk production and ensure offspring survival.

In a paper published in Functional Ecology, a journal of the British Ecological Society, a collaborative team of researchers from U of I, Washington State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and U.S. Geological Survey studied how the risk of heat stress was influenced by activity and milk production in grizzly bears. The team also evaluated the importance of bear behaviors such as submerging in cool water for alleviating that heat stress.

“We found that the activity level of lactating female grizzly bears was much more limited by heat than the activity of non-lactating females, and that this disparity increased in a warmer climate scenario,” Long said.

Using computer models, the researchers sought to predict the potential effects of a changing climate on female grizzlies with versus without cubs.

“We found that the use of ‘bathtubs’ by female bears to cool could help them overcome constraints on activity and milk production imposed by heat, even in a warmer climate,” Rogers said.

The “bathtubs” include natural depressions containing water that are deeper than the wallows commonly used by ungulates such as elk and allow bears to fully submerge.

Researchers learned that although heat was not the most important factor influencing the distribution of bears across the Yellowstone landscape — elevation and distance to roads were most important — it had a greater effect on the behavior of lactating than non-lactating females, and access to pools of cool water was an important mechanism for relieving heat stress.

“Our research suggests that as the climate warms, grizzly bears can avoid heat stress through behaviors such as ‘bath-taking,’ and thus access to cool water will likely become increasingly important,” Long said.

With climate change fueling higher temperatures, 2020 is essentially tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record. While fighting COVID-19, communities across India experienced sweltering heat last summer, temperatures reaching 47.5ºC in some parts of the country. In addition to raising temperatures, climate change and rising income levels increase the demand for cooling—leading to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Protecting the vulnerable from extreme heat in a severely climate affected country is critical. Cool roofs are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to fight the heat—as shown by community-led initiatives in four cities in India.

Community-led program in Bhopal MHT

Cool roofs keep indoor temperatures lower and can help decrease the dependence on air conditioners. Cool roofs reflect sunlight and absorb less heat. Depending on the setting, cool roofs can help keep indoor temperatures lower by 2 to 5°C (3.6 to 9°F) as compared to traditional roofs.

As discussed in the Kigali Amendment – signaled for ratification by the Biden Administration this week—and the Indian Cooling Action Plan, cool roofs and energy efficiency solutions are key strategy for sustainable cooling and combating climate change. The benefits of cool roofs also include increased thermal comfort by keeping indoor temperatures lower, reduced and can help reduce future cooling demand from air conditioners as well as reduce air pollution since they save energy, especially on cooling appliances, such as fans and air conditioners.

Ahead of the 2021 heat season, NRDC and partners Mahila Housing Trust (MHT) painted the roofs of selected slum households with solar reflective paint. People living in slums and low-income communities are particularly heat vulnerable—a large percentage of their homes are far from optimal, with few options for cooling. The cool roof initiatives are in four cities—Jodhpur, Bhopal, Surat, and Ahmedabad. The households were selected based on the household’s electricity bill, having a tin roof, direct sunlight exposure, and number of household members sharing the space.

Benefits of the cool roofs and demonstrations:

Save energy and reduce heat stress: painting slums roofs with solar reflective paint helped keep indoor temperatures lower by 2 - 5°C (3.6 - 9°F), compared to traditional roofs. The demonstrations also featured an energy savings component for the households by replacing incandescent bulbs with LED.

Outreach on cool roofs as heat mitigation technology: the demonstrations acted as an outreach tool to spread the word to the larger community. The demonstrations covered more than 460 roofs and reached 13,587 households and 67,935 individuals with information on solar reflective paint.

Skill development of households: MHT has local community workers that train the household to paint their own cool roof. This saves the labor costs and builds the household’s capacity by learning the skill.

Ahead of the 2021 heat season, cities, states and the national government are taking steps to protect communities and save energy costs, through cool roof programs. The city of Ahmedabad is likely to resume its target to paint 15,000 slum roofs with cool paint. Telangana, in collaboration with NRDC and partners, is expected to release a cool roofs policy. Through these community-led cool roof initiatives ahead of the upcoming heat season, cities have time to implement programs and prepare vulnerable households for extreme heat, save energy and combat climate change.

Experts from the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists discuss the development.

Advanced technologies have penetrated areas of a mining operation beyond the much-publicised uptake of automation.

Inherent to the extreme mining conditions in Australia, large mining companies are leading the way in the use of technology to help workers manage the risks of heat stress.

Their goal in adopting today’s technology is to alter a mining environment so that it becomes a safer workplace, signalling a change in industry focus when it comes to heat stress.

“Where the traditional focus has been around when to stop working when it reaches a certain temperature, and how long one can safely continue working before taking a break, companies are now looking at how they can control the environment,” Ross Di Corleto, a member of Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists (AIOH), tells Safe to Work.

“It’s no longer just a case of adjusting individuals to the environment, but changing the environment to suit the individuals so that they can work safely and be more productive.”

Health and safety professionals are increasing monitoring in the field to identify environmental and other potential sources of heat, such as tasks and processes that specifically induce heat strain in an individual.

Mining companies are looking for data to help them identify controls to eliminate or reduce the risk.

They are being helped by mine workers who are increasingly open to using technology that tracks personal bodily changes. One such example is a telemetry pill that is ingested, to measure the impact of environmental factors on workers in real time by measuring core body temperature.

According to AIOH member, Jodie Britton, there is a growing interest in telemetry pills among mining and other resource industries across Australia.

The approach relies on workers volunteering to be monitored, and more of them are offering to participate as they see the benefits of the technology.

“You can watch the worker and be viewing the information in real time on your phone, making it much simpler to identify specific tasks that are inducing heat strain,” she says.

“There’s nothing better than data that can pinpoint where the issues are in the workplace.

“I have first-hand experience in seeing data collected that leads to very significant changes in the workplace. And now I’ve got workers asking questions about it because they can see how the data has resulted in changes that have improved people’s wellbeing.”

In addition to the telemetry pill, the proliferation of technologies in the area of heat stress also includes smart garments that collect personnel’s biometric data.

Information such a person’s heart rate, temperature and breathing rate is relayed back to a control room or central location to indicate how they are coping with the heat stress.

In addition to monitoring workers’ reactions to heat, new technology is also helping keep these workers outside of hot zones in the first place.

Drones are being used to access hot areas such as roofs and mining pits to perform inspections remotely and to deliver goods to work sites to limit worker movement.

Britton says the use of drones is becoming more common in the mining industry to inspect the blast areas, significantly reducing heat stress.

“I’ve talked to mine workers in Western Australia who said that drone technology had been an absolute gamechanger from a heat stress and safety perspective. They no longer have to go down to the pit as often,” Britton says.

AIOH’s Di Corleto, who has four decades of experience in the mining industry, says miners are not only motivated by safety and health impacts to improve heat stress management, but productivity as well.

“I would love to say that it’s solely aimed around protecting the health of our workers, but that’s not the only target,” he says.

“People are starting to acknowledge that our environment is only going to get hotter, so we better start managing our work and people’s exposure to heat.

“And by looking after our workers, we’re improving productivity and quality of work in the workplace. It’s a win-win situation.”

According to Di Corleto, every increase in temperature of a few degrees leads to a significant drop in productivity.

Managing heat stress therefore leads to improved productivity, while reducing workplace incidents and injuries.

This is because as the temperature heats up, employees lose concentration, their fine motor skills depreciate and their cognitive function reduces.

Other early indications of heat stress include fatigue, as well as reduced hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills.

At the most extreme level, high temperatures can lead to heat stroke, which is a serious medical condition where a person’s control systems and organs begin to shut down.

They endure significant impairment such as kidney damage and the haemorrhaging of blood vessels, and it can ultimately result in a fatality.

Di Corleto adds that there is also a proven link between heat stress and safety incidents and injuries.

“Heat illness can occur at surprisingly low temperatures if the right combination of high humidity and low wind speeds are present,” he says.

Britton, who has worked in the heavy industry for 28 years, says most mining companies are today training and educating their workers about the risks of heat stress.

This is a welcome shift, as many years ago companies struggled to recognise the signs and effects of heat stress.

“Companies are now taking the issue of heat stress seriously,” Britton says.

“People in leadership roles benefit from education as do project leaders and engineers, due to their key role in the design and planning of mines.

“Likewise, workers would benefit from a greater understanding of the long-term, chronic effects of heat stress. After all, heat stress is a lot more than just about being well-hydrated.”

The device offers farmers and plant scientists a new tool for early diagnosis and real-time monitoring of plant health in field conditions.

Precision agriculture is an important strategy for tackling growing food insecurity through sustainable farming practices, but it requires new technologies for rapid diagnosis of plant stresses before the onset of visible symptoms and subsequent yield loss. SMART’s new portable Raman leaf-clip sensor is a useful tool in precision agriculture allowing early diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency in plants, which can be linked to premature leaf deterioration and loss of yield.

In a paper titled “Portable Raman leaf-clip sensor for rapid detection of plant stress,” published in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists explain how they designed, constructed, and tested the leaf clip that allows the optical sensor to probe the leaf chemistry and establish the stress state. The work was developed in the Disruptive and Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) Interdisciplinary Research Group (IRG) within SMART, MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore.

“Our findings showed that in vivo measurements using the portable leaf-clip Raman sensor under full-light growth conditions were consistent with measurements obtained with a benchtop Raman spectrometer on leaf sections under laboratory conditions,” says MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science Rajeev Ram, co-lead author of the paper and principal investigator at DiSTAP. “We demonstrated that early diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency — a critical nutrient, and the most important component of fertilizers — in living plants is possible with the portable sensor.”

While the study mainly looked at measuring nitrogen levels in plants, the device can also be used to detect levels of other plant stress phenotypes such as drought, heat and cold stress, saline stress, and light stress. The wide range of plant stressors that can be detected by these leaf-clip Raman probes and their simplicity and speed makes them ideal for field use by farmers to ensure crop health.

“While we have focused on the early and specific diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency using the leaf-clip sensor, we were able to measure peaks from other metabolites that are also clearly observed in popular vegetables such as kailan, lettuce, choy sum, pak choi, and spinach,” says Chung Hao Huang, co-first author of the paper and a postdoc at TLL.

The team believes their findings can aid farmers to maximize crop yield, while ensuring minimal negative impacts on the environment, including minimizing pollution of aquatic ecosystems by reducing nitrogen runoff and infiltration into the water table.

“The sensor was demonstrated on multiple vegetable varieties and supports the effort to produce nutritious, low-cost vegetables as part of the Singapore 30-by-30 initiative,” says Professor Nam-Hai Chua, co-lead principal investigator at DiSTAP, deputy chair at TLL, and co-lead author of the study. “Extension of this work to a wider variety of crops may contribute globally to improved crop yields, greater climate resiliency, and mitigation of environmental pollution through reduced fertilizer use.”

The portable Raman system was designed in collaboration with local company TechnoSpex. The leaf-clip Raman sensor consists of a 3D printed clip that is built around a fiber-based Raman probe assembly.

Shilpi Gupta, postdoc at DiSTAP, was co-first author of the paper and Gajendra Pratap Singh, scientific director at DiSTAP, also co-authored the article. The research was carried out by SMART and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program.

The DiSTAP program addresses deep problems in food production in Singapore and the world by developing a suite of impactful and novel analytical, genetic, and biosynthetic technologies. The goal is to fundamentally change how plant biosynthetic pathways are discovered, monitored, engineered and ultimately translated to meet the global demand for food and nutrients.

Scientists from MIT, TLL, Nanyang Technological University, and National University of Singapore are collaboratively developing new tools for the continuous measurement of important plant metabolites and hormones for novel discovery and deeper understanding and control of plant biosynthetic pathways in ways not yet possible, especially in the context of green leafy vegetables; leveraging these new techniques to engineer plants with highly desirable properties for global food security, including high yield density production, drought and pathogen resistance, and biosynthesis of high-value commercial products; developing tools for producing hydrophobic food components in industry-relevant microbes; developing novel microbial and enzymatic technologies to produce volatile organic compounds that can protect and/or promote growth of leafy vegetables; and applying these technologies to improve urban farming.

DiSTAP is led by MIT co-lead principal investigator Professor Michael Strano and Singapore co-lead principal investigator Professor Chua Nam Hai.

SMART was established by MIT and the NRF in 2007. SMART is the first entity in CREATE developed by NRF. SMART serves as an intellectual and innovation hub for research interactions between MIT and Singapore, undertaking cutting-edge research projects in areas of interest to both. SMART currently comprises an Innovation Centre and five IRGs: Antimicrobial Resistance, Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized-Medicine, DiSTAP, Future Urban Mobility, and Low Energy Electronic Systems."

At Heat games, fans arriving for the game will be brought to a screening area and the detection dogs will walk past.","fan, planning, season, dogs, fans, screening, dog, bring, ticket, games, help, holders, heat, used",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"MIAMI (AP) — The Miami Heat are bringing back some fans, with help from some dogs.

The Heat will use coronavirus-sniffing dogs at AmericanAirlines Arena to screen fans who want to attend their games. They’ve been working on the plan for months, and the highly trained dogs have been in place for some games this season where the team has allowed a handful of guests — mostly friends and family of players and staff.

Starting this week, a limited number of ticket holders will be in the seats as well, provided they get past the dogs first.

“If you think about it, detection dogs are not new,” said Matthew Jafarian, the Heat’s executive vice president for business strategy. “You’ve seen them in airports, they’ve been used in mission critical situations by the police and the military. We’ve used them at the arena for years to detect explosives.”

The first Heat game with ticket holders is set for Thursday against the Los Angeles Clippers. Monday is the first day that season ticket holders will be able to start securing their seats.

The Heat have sold out 451 consecutive games, the sixth-longest streak in NBA history. Sellouts, obviously, aren’t happening this year. The Heat will keep attendance under 2,000 for now, or less than 10% of the building’s typical capacity.

“Please note that seating will be very limited, as we will be observing proper physical distancing,” the team said in its letter to season ticket holders.

The coronavirus-sniffing dog idea has been put into place at airports in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Helsinki, Finland, in recent months. At Heat games, fans arriving for the game will be brought to a screening area and the detection dogs will walk past. If the dog keeps going, the fan is cleared; if the dog sits, that’s a sign it’s detected the virus and the fan will be denied entry.

Other protocols the Heat will use: A health screening questionnaire will be mandatory for all guests, masks must be worn continually and only soda and water will be sold. All transactions will be cashless and if a fan feels ill during a game, isolation rooms will be available.

And if a fan is allergic to or afraid of dogs, the Heat are offering an option to skip the dog screening and submit to a rapid antigen test instead. The Heat say those tests can be processed in less than 45 minutes.

Dogs have a superior sense of smell, which is why they’re often used by law enforcement to find everything from drugs to bombs to missing people. Medical researchers have long reaped the benefit of canine sniffing, training some dogs to detect when a human is dealing with things like too much stress, too little blood sugar and even certain cancers.

A German study last year found that dogs there were right 94% of the time when it came to coronavirus detection.

“Researchers are finding that specially trained dogs can detect COVID on humans quickly and accurately,” Jafarian said."

Fuelling them with warm drinks, dressing them as though they're going to Siberia. It's just what parents do.

But we can relax a bit in summer, right? Rip off everything except the nappy/undies, fill up the kiddie pool, and chuck them in with an icy pole?

Well, not really. Keeping toddlers and babies safe from the heat is not quite so simple.

For example, it's not well known that young children don't always show signs of being uncomfortably hot in the way adults do. For starters, the littler ones can't say ""I'm hot"".

And they do get hotter than older kids and adults.

""A young child's body can heat up 3-5 times faster than an adult's body in a car, for instance,"" says Dr Preeya Alexander, a family GP in Melbourne.

""Lots of people aren't aware of this fact.""

If babies and young children are not kept safe in the heat, they risk developing heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion, which can come on suddenly.

So, what do you need to be aware of with small kids and heat?

The basics on child safety in hot weather

Melbourne paediatrician Dr Trupti Prasad explains why young children experience heat differently to us:

""Babies and young children do not regulate body temperature as well as adults and older children. This is in part because they perspire less, and because they generate more warmth as they exercise and move.

""They are also less able to recognise that they are overheated, or indicate their needs for cooling, until later.""

This means it's up to a child's carer to be proactive about their needs.

""Parents and carers need to be vigilant about ensuring that children stay cool – wear hats and protective clothing, stay in the shade, and encourage them to drink water regularly, as well as rest.""

Dr Prasad says these are the essentials:

Avoid dehydration: offer more drinks (preferably water)

Avoid dehydration: offer more drinks (preferably water) Dress in cool clothing which also must be sun safe

Dress in cool clothing which also must be sun safe Hats and sunscreen outdoors, always

Hats and sunscreen outdoors, always Limit time outdoors when it's hot (in general 11am–5pm)

Limit time outdoors when it's hot (in general 11am–5pm) Enforce activity breaks for rest and hydration

Enforce activity breaks for rest and hydration NEVER leave a child in a car

Dr Prasad stresses the importance of never leaving a child in the car, even when the engine is running and using air conditioning.

""Leaving a child in a car unattended is not recommended in any circumstances, as vehicles can heat up quickly, even when the windows are down.

""You may think you may be able to tolerate such temperatures, but your young child certainly can't, even for what you think is a few minutes.""

The Raising Children Network also tells parents to: ""Check the temperature of car seats, harnesses and seat belts before your child gets into the car. Hot metal, plastic or leather can burn your child. If surfaces are hot, cover them with a damp cloth and then help your child into the car.""

For babies under six months of age, Dr Alexander explains that sun avoidance is recommended, because of the risks to their delicate skin, and the high risk of overheating. But if they do go out in the sun, they must wear light clothing, hats and sunscreen.

How can you tell if your child is hydrated enough if they aren't showing any signs of thirst?

""Keep track of how many wet nappies a child has in a 24-hour period. This will indicate their hydration level; six to eight wet nappies is ideal,"" Dr Prasad says.

""And especially if you're breastfeeding, your hydration is important, too.""

How does a child feel when they get hot?

Dr Alexander explains that because ""children cannot regulate their body temperature as readily as adults through mechanisms such as sweating, you can't always tell by simply looking at them"".

""When children are overheated, they can dehydrate rapidly and become lethargic, irritable, drowsy.""

Dr Prasad adds, ""It's important to remember that heat and thirst doesn't always stop a child from being active, so enforce breaks and offer plenty of water.""

Dr Prasad also warns that some breastfeeding children may be reluctant to feed because the skin-to-skin contact is too uncomfortable in the heat.

""Use a sheet or towel between you to cool things down for both of you.""

Sleep and kids in the heat

The experts both say it's essential to monitor the temperature in the room in which a child is asleep.

If, for example, you close the door to avoid sound disturbance, the temperature can rise quickly if the room is not cooled.

""This is even if the child has been put to sleep in the coolest room of the house,"" Dr Prasad warns.

The same can be said for a child being covered in a pram or a baby capsule; ensure air is circulating at all times.

""The ideal and safest temperature for young children to sleep is between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius. If you're using a fan, don't direct it straight onto the child, rather use it to keep the air in the room circulating,"" Dr Prasad explains.

Heatstroke vs heat exhaustion

Introducing shade as a mechanism to mitigate this is one way to offer relief.

Heat waves in the US have caused widespread death in cattle. After the 1995 heat event in Iowa, it was found that non-shaded lots experienced a much higher death toll than shaded lots (4.8% and 0.2% respectively). Cattle that do survive periods of extreme heat experience reduced productivity, resulting in economic loss. In 2003, a study found that an estimated $1.69-2.36 billion was lost in the livestock industry due to heat stress.

As well as the effect on the economy, global temperature increase has become another driving force behind discussions on heat stress and animal welfare and has cast a spotlight on the importance of developing and implementing mitigation strategies, such a shading. Whilst well-reviewed in dairy cows, the research on using shade as a stress reduction strategy in beef cattle is still largely inconclusive. There is some evidence to suggest that shade does reduce heat stress, but industry guidelines are not consistent and as a result, producers can be reluctant to implement these strategies.

Animal welfare is not just about the productivity of livestock. Polsky and von Keyserlingk (2017) illustrated that when a dairy cow is not able to find shade in a hot climate the cow’s ability to express natural behaviors is impacted. The lack of shade will subsequently affect the performance of the cow and reduce productivity. Although based on a dairy cow, these findings have also been applied to beef cows on pasture. Increased attention to their welfare ensures cattle will perform more successfully.

New research published in Nature Food warns that heat stress in animals caused by rising temperatures and humidity will occur more frequently and for longer periods, impacting milk and meat productivity for dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, goat, pigs and poultry across East Africa.

Analysis of historical data from 1981-2010 shows that livestock have already been progressively subjected to heat stress conditions. According to projections, this is set to worsen significantly, with severe implications for livestock unable to cope with the extra heat.

Authors warn that 4-19% of current meat and milk production occurs in areas where dangerous heat stress conditions are likely to increase in frequency from 2071-2100. If climate conditions persist at their current accelerated rate, elevated levels of heat stress could make much of East Africa unsuitable for exotic pig, poultry and dairy cattle production unless direct and immediate action is taken.

Using limited available data and current climate projections, researchers say that dairy production is expected to be hit hardest in South Sudan, Southern parts of Eritrea, and eastern and northwestern parts of Kenya. In Uganda, heat stress conditions are already prevalent in parts of the country, requiring collective action to sustain and protect the pig sector there.

Urgent planning and investment required

Klaus Butterbach-Bahl at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe (KIT), which analyzed the climate data, said: ""This paper is an alarm bell for policymakers and anyone involved in livestock in the tropical region.

""In East Africa, where protein consumption is already low, this could worsen the food and nutrition security situation.""

At the Alliance of Bioversity International and International Center for Tropical Agriculture, livestock expert An Notenbaert said: ""We knew that climate change would bring problems for animals, yet we were surprised about the magnitude of change.

""Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures absolutely need to be factored into decisions and strategies for livestock production.""

Breed animals, enact measures to help animals cope

According to the authors, well-targeted and evidence-based climate adaptation will enable livestock production to continue and expand across East Africa. This includes identifying and making available productive animal breeds that are adapted to local conditions, particularly heat.

Countries like Rwanda and Kenya have moved towards using exotic breeds to meet the growing demand for milk in their countries. ""Holstein Friesians, a popular imported breed, are not indigenous to Africa. Although they produce more milk than local breeds, they do not cope well with heat,"" said Notenbaert. ""To make livestock production more environmentally efficient, we need breeds that can cope with rising temperatures while at the same time produce more meat and milk.""

In addition to breeding, countries need to look to other mitigation strategies to increase resilience. This could be in the form of shelters or other means of shading to shield animals and ensuring sufficient water access.

""We urgently have to invest and plan now, because mitigation will have costs for farmers and donors,"" Notenbaert said. ""We must be able to quantify economic and livelihood losses, for example through a reduction in milk yield. And we need economic, policy and livelihood measures to avoid the impacts of temperature changes.""

One part of the bigger picture

ILRI livestock breeder Karen Marshall said: ""Heat stress in livestock, besides being an animal welfare issue, also means less income to the farmer, less efficient use of natural resources, and higher greenhouse gas emissions per unit of livestock product.

""It is important to keep in mind, however, that while heat stress provides an important lens on the effect of climate change on animals, it is just one part of the picture.""

Researchers caution that although the study only examined the direct consequences of climate change on animals, other climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods—which can impact feed production, water supply and proliferation of disease and pests—should also be taken into consideration.

Every summer, about 150 Yuma myotis bats return to the box, using it as a maternity colony to give birth to pups and take care of them until they are ready to leave for hibernation in the autumn.

“We noticed that as soon as the sun hit the bat box, they would become agitated. We could see them come down to the bottom of the box, trying to cool down and get fresh air,” says Latour.

One summer morning, he discovered 28 dead pups underneath the box and realised they had succumbed to excessive heat. So Latour initially draped the box with a bed sheet to shade it, and later installed a blind that he could open and close to keep the sun off the box in the early morning. The fix worked. “Once they were back in the shade, everybody would shut up for the day and we did not hear them move around in the morning any more.”

Bats play an important role in the ecosystem. As voracious predators of insects, for example, they help to control crop pests, reducing the need for pesticides on agricultural land. So, over the years, animal lovers, conservation organisations and naturalist groups have installed artificial bat boxes to replace lost buildings and natural roosts where the bats come back year after year.

But scientists are now discovering that in a rapidly warming climate, overheating bat boxes can be a death trap.

Female bats rely on the surrounding air temperature to maintain their body heat and need a warm environment to raise their pups. “Bat boxes can be beneficial as they can help pups grow faster and females gather the energy they need for lactation,” says Joy O’Keefe, an assistant professor who studies the roosting and ecology of bats at the University of Illinois department of natural resources and environmental sciences.

But if the roost is too hot the bats become heat-stressed. “Bats walk a tightrope because a few degrees change can make a difference as to whether they live or die,” says Cori Lausen, a bat biologist with Wildlife Conservation Society Canada.

In the wild, bats frequently move between rock and tree crevices to find the right temperature – not too cold and not too hot. Lausen found that a colony of female big brown bats she studied in Alberta used 72 different rock-crevice roosts during the summer. “If you think of a colony in nature needing that many roosts to find the just right temperature every day to raise their pups, how can we possibly give them just one bat box? We can clearly see that they need a lot of choices,” Lausen says.

When they take up residence in the attic of an old building, bats can move inside the space. But they can’t do this as easily in a small bat house. They become more vulnerable to overheating and dehydration.

In June 2019, Susan Dulc, a master’s student at British Columbia’s Thompson Rivers University, received a call from a landowner who had noticed that bats were flying during the daytime, leaving the bat box that had been installed on the property for the shade of a nearby walnut tree. Dulc, who is comparing the microclimate conditions in bat boxes and buildings in the Kootenay and Okanagan regions of the province, discovered that the temperature was more than 42C inside the box with 100% humidity – a lethal threshold for the Yuma myotis bat and the little brown bat species that Dulc is monitoring. “We found that bat boxes are much warmer than ambient temperatures,” she says.

As temperature records are broken and heatwaves become more frequent and longer lasting, the problem of bats overheating has become a global concern. In the Catalonia region of Spain, Carles Flaquer, a bat research group coordinator for the Natural History Museum of Granollers, documented 797 overheating events during a bat-box monitoring programme over a period of 150 days, with temperatures reaching more than 40C. “We have seen amazing increases in temperatures in Catalonia, and the episodes of overheating have been terrible for the bats,” he says.

Wildlife rehabilitation centres are receiving large numbers of grounded bats suffering from dehydration during the breeding season, not just those roosting in boxes but also in buildings. In the UK, 63 pipistrelle bat pups were rescued in the Manchester area after falling to the ground from a building roof that had become too hot during a heatwave in July 2020. “Every year, temperatures are rising a bit more and we are reaching a critical phase where heatwaves are becoming at a level that is a danger for bat populations,” says Orly Razgour, senior lecturer in ecology at the University of Exeter.

Razgour is studying how the distribution of bats in the UK will be affected by the climate crisis in the future. “Over the next 30 years we will see reduced climatic suitability across many parts of the UK, in particular in the most southeastern parts. Put on top extreme heat events and it will happen a lot more rapidly,” she says. “Bats have a very slow reproductive rate and when those extreme heat events start to happen more frequently, bat populations will find it more difficult to recover.”

In the meantime, as temperatures continue to rise elsewhere in Europe, the UK can expect more bat visitors, says Carol Williams, director of conservation at the Bat Conservation Trust. “We will start to see the UK become more important for a larger number of species of bats.” For example, the grey long-eared bats that are among the UK’s rarest mammals, with fewer than 1,000 individuals, are expected to struggle in the increasingly hotter climates of Spain and Portugal and may find more suitable conditions in the UK.

But the unimproved grasslands that grey long-eared bats rely on have declined by more than 92% in the past 100 years, says Williams. The Back from the Brink project aims to change this and works with landowners to retain and enhance habitats for the bats. “We need to make sure our landscapes allow the species to fare well,” she says.

The impact of heatwaves has been particularly dramatic in Australia, causing mortality among flying foxes almost every year. Justin Welbergen, associate professor of animal ecology at Western Sydney University and president of the Australasian Bat Society, found evidence that at least 226,000 flying foxes had died during extreme heat events since records began, with 196,000 mortalities since 2008.

In south-east Queensland, at least 45,500 flying foxes died on one scorching day in January 2014. In November 2018, temperatures exceeding 42C in Australia’s north wiped out 23,000 spectacled flying foxes over two days. In December 2019 and January 2020, more than 65,000 flying foxes died in a series of extreme heat events.

“Since the 1970s, the chance of a grey-headed flying fox encountering temperatures greater than 42C has increased about threefold,” says Welbergen. “As climate change is progressing and these events become more common, this is going to put a lot of pressure on flying fox populations.”

The animals are already vulnerable to other threats, including habitat loss and persecution, but climate breakdown is now a leading concern for the survival of some of the species. “There is a real present risk that the spectacled flying fox and possibly the grey-headed flying fox will go extinct in Australia by the end of the century purely because of the effect of temperature extremes,” Welbergen says.

Flying foxes play an important ecological role as pollinators and seed dispersers. “They provide the glue that keeps the increasingly fragmented forest of Australia together,” he adds.

Scientists and conservationists are now investigating solutions to help bats cope with heatwaves. Teams from Western Sydney University and the University of Melbourne led by Welbergen have developed a flying fox heat stress forecaster that predicts the roost (or “camp” as they are called in Australia) locations where flying foxes are likely to experience extreme heat, up to 72 hours in advance. The tool helps wildlife carers, land managers and other stakeholders take action to limit flying fox die-offs.

In the US, researchers are testing various bat box designs and locations with different solar exposures to see which are best for the endangered Indiana bat. They recorded temperatures as high as 52C in some boxes but found that modifications such as adding a chimney or a water chamber, or painting the boxes in lighter colours, could help stabilise temperatures.

The bats, however, may not be able to spot the difference between box designs. “If you put a box up in the right spot, bats might be just using it because of where it is on the landscape, not necessarily because of the microclimate a particular box design provides,” says Reed Crawford, a PhD student at the University of Illinois who is studying Indiana bat roosting preferences. “Unfortunately, you get a lot of mortalities when people put out bad designs in good places.”

As location seems to be a bat’s mantra when it comes to choosing the right piece of real estate, Lausen is working on a set of guidelines to help landowners and wildlife managers in British Columbia install appropriate boxes. “We need to step back and think about how we can make these boxes better and safer for our bats,” she says.

Lausen encourages people to place several boxes in different spots – sunny, mixed sun and shade – to offer as many microclimates as possible so that bats have several options to choose from that are a short flight away. “Over the years, landowners have chased bats out of their attics and put up bat boxes instead, but that’s giving them one tiny portion of what they used to have,” Lausen says. “We know a single bat box is not going to meet the needs of a bat colony throughout the season.”

Lausen also promotes a bat-friendly approach in the neighbourhood. “Everybody needs to start talking to their neighbours and look beyond their back yard because bats are community resources,” she says. “It takes a village to raise bats.”

This article was amended on 26 February 2021. Cori Lausen originally said a one-degree change could affect whether bats live or die, but she later indicated the measure was likely to be slightly more than one degree.

""The nice thing about our thermoelectric device is that you can wear it, and it provides you with constant power.""

The device, described today in the journal Science Advances, is stretchy enough that you can wear it like a ring, a bracelet or any other accessory that touches your skin. It also taps into a person's natural heat -- employing thermoelectric generators to convert the body's internal temperature into electricity.

""In the future, we want to be able to power your wearable electronics without having to include a battery,"" said Jianliang Xiao, senior author of the new paper and an associate professor in the Paul M. Rady Department of Mechanical Engineering at CU Boulder.

The concept may sound like something out of The Matrix film series, in which a race of robots have enslaved humans to harvest their precious organic energy. Xiao and his colleagues aren't that ambitious: Their devices can generate about 1 volt of energy for every square centimeter of skin space -- less voltage per area than what most existing batteries provide but still enough to power electronics like watches or fitness trackers.

Scientists have previously experimented with similar thermoelectric wearable devices, but Xiao's is stretchy, can heal itself when damaged and is fully recyclable -- making it a cleaner alternative to traditional electronics.

""Whenever you use a battery, you're depleting that battery and will, eventually, need to replace it,"" Xiao said. ""The nice thing about our thermoelectric device is that you can wear it, and it provides you with constant power.""

The project isn't Xiao's first attempt to meld human with robot. He and his colleagues previously experimented with designing ""electronic skin,"" wearable devices that look, and behave, much like real human skin. That android epidermis, however, has to be connected to an external power source to work.

Until now. The group's latest innovation begins with a base made out of a stretchy material called polyimine. The scientists then stick a series of thin thermoelectric chips into that base, connecting them all with liquid metal wires. The final product looks like a cross between a plastic bracelet and a miniature computer motherboard or maybe a techy diamond ring.

""Our design makes the whole system stretchable without introducing much strain to the thermoelectric material, which can be really brittle,"" Xiao said.

Just pretend that you're out for a jog. As you exercise, your body heats up, and that heat will radiate out to the cool air around you. Xiao's device captures that flow of energy rather than letting it go to waste.

""The thermoelectric generators are in close contact with the human body, and they can use the heat that would normally be dissipated into the environment,"" he said.

Lego blocks

He added that you can easily boost that power by adding in more blocks of generators. In that sense, he compares his design to a popular children's toy.

""What I can do is combine these smaller units to get a bigger unit,"" he said. ""It's like putting together a bunch of small Lego pieces to make a large structure. It gives you a lot of options for customization.""

Xiao and his colleagues calculated, for example, that a person taking a brisk walk could use a device the size of a typical sports wristband to generate about 5 volts of electricity -- which is more than what many watch batteries can muster.

Like Xiao's electronic skin, the new devices are as resilient as biological tissue. If your device tears, for example, you can pinch together the broken ends, and they'll seal back up in just a few minutes. And when you're done with the device, you can dunk it into a special solution that will separate out the electronic components and dissolve the polyimine base -- each and every one of those ingredients can then be reused.

""We're trying to make our devices as cheap and reliable as possible, while also having as close to zero impact on the environment as possible,"" Xiao said.

While there are still kinks to work out in the design, he thinks that his group's devices could appear on the market in five to 10 years. Just don't tell the robots. We don't want them getting any ideas.

“Cattle are very robust creatures; they are able to withstand a wide range of temperatures,” Waggoner says.

Typically, they won’t experience cold stress until the ambient temperature (the ‘real-feel’ temperature) reaches 18 degrees F.”Rain, snow and wind complicate the situation, Waggoner adds.

Justin Waggoner, a beef systems specialist with K-State Research and Extension, says producers are often ready to deal with heat stress during the summer, but cold stress during the latter stages of winter can also be challenging.

“Cattle are very robust creatures; they are able to withstand a wide range of temperatures,” Waggoner says. “But January and February are often our most extreme temperatures in Kansas, and that can certainly have an impact on cattle.”

Cattle are most comfortable when they are in what is known as the thermoneutral zone, a range of temperatures where they are not experiencing cold or heat stress.

Moisture problems

Waggoner says a cow’s condition going into a cold period will affect how the animal can withstand stress.

“If we have a cow that is in good condition, she is going to be able to withstand colder temperatures better than a cow that is exceptionally thin,” he says. “If we take a cow that is in good condition and has had adequate time to grow that winter hair coat, that animal can withstand some fairly cold temperatures. Typically, they won’t experience cold stress until the ambient temperature (the ‘real-feel’ temperature) reaches 18 degrees F.”

Rain, snow and wind complicate the situation, Waggoner adds.

“When you wet that hair down, it reduces its ability to trap air and insulate the cow,” he says. “With a wet coat, a cow can experience cold stress even at 60 degrees F.”

Push the feed

Waggoner says cold stress increases the cow’s energy requirement, not protein ⸺ which is a common misconception.

“One thing we see producers do when we get a cold weather event is, they roll out hay,” Waggoner says. “What I recommend is utilizing hay that is slightly better quality than the forage those cattle currently are grazing. For example, if they had been turned out on milo or cornstalks, then a moderate-quality grass hay will be higher quality than those stalks they were on.”

Waggoner also suggests that other high-quality forages, such as alfalfa, may be used as a supplement.

“In some regions of the country, it’s not uncommon for producers to use concentrates such as corn or byproducts as supplements during the winter. Producers might add 1 to 2 pounds of corn or byproduct feedstuffs under conditions of a storm front, in combination with some of the other things I’ve mentioned.”

For more guidelines on dealing with cold stress, producers are encouraged to contact their local K-State Research and Extension agent.

Daily updates on weather conditions ⸺ including an animal comfort index ⸺ is available online from the Kansas Mesonet, mesonet.k-state.edu. That site allows producers to find conditions specific to their location.

Overall, when we revisit a site that Grinnell surveyed we find about half of the bird species that he would have observed and no change in the number of mammal species,” Wolf said.
Ramirez collected physiological data on small mammals in the Mojave Desert.
Ramirez, whose Ph.D. focuses on geographic and seasonal variation in physiology of heat stress in small mammals from the Mojave Desert, spent several summers and winters in the Mojave working on the small mammals.
The Mojave Desert is a place where animal behavior and activity are sharply constrained by the climate.","shows, species, mammals, lead, mojave, birds, change, climate, wolf, extinction, desert, bird, research, heat, small",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Professor Blair Wolf and Ph.D. student Ric Ramirez from the Department of Biology at The University of New Mexico and colleagues published a paper in Science this week about their research that shows bird populations and species richness in the Mojave Desert are suffering from climate change, while small mammal populations are showing no appreciable change.

Professor Blair Wolf in the field

Wolf was part of a collaborative with partners at University of California, Berkeley and the San Diego Natural History Museum. He was also a Principal Investigator on the National Science Foundation award to UNM. He was one of the designers of the research project and his research focuses on water and energy balance in desert animals and how heat stress affects behavior, activity, and performance.

The research shows that differing animal groups, and even individual species, respond differently to changes in climate even at a single site, Wolf explained. The work is based on resurvey data where a crew went to sites in the Mojave Desert that were originally surveyed by Joseph Grinnell and associates in the 1900s.

The difference between how the small desert mammal species responded in contrast to the desert bird species was striking and significant.

“Our team resurveyed these sites ̶ 90 for mammals and 61 for birds ̶ and found no change in the species richness or occupancy of small mammals, but for birds, in contrast, occupancy and species richness declined markedly across 39 sites. Overall, when we revisit a site that Grinnell surveyed we find about half of the bird species that he would have observed and no change in the number of mammal species,” Wolf said.

Ramirez collected physiological data on small mammals in the Mojave Desert. Ramirez, whose Ph.D. focuses on geographic and seasonal variation in physiology of heat stress in small mammals from the Mojave Desert, spent several summers and winters in the Mojave working on the small mammals. He is a U.S. Army veteran of the 82nd Airborne Division and was a medic in Afghanistan. This is his first publication.

Ramirez and other students in Wolf’s lab collected data on the physiological performance of mammals and birds in the heat that we use to check the heat flux models for accuracy.

“Modelling efforts by lead author Dr. Eric Riddell for how heat exposure affects the energy and water requirements for birds and mammals shows that because small mammals retreat to cool, shaded microhabitats during the heat of the day, such as burrows, for example, and are nocturnally active, that this behavior provides a buffer from the heat that reduces the need to cool by evaporating large quantities of water, which is in short supply in deserts,” Wolf noted. “In contrast, birds are diurnal [active during the day] and confront the heat of the day and high solar heat loads directly because they don't use burrows as refuge from the heat. The bird declines are likely a consequence of these differences in behavior. Overall, in future climates the water requirements for birds are projected to increase three- to four-fold in birds and only modestly for small mammals in the Mojave Desert.”

The Details Title: Exposure to climate change drives stability or collapse of desert mammal and bird communities Publication: Science Magazine DOI: 10.1126/science.abd4605 Link: Science Magazine

Identifying the factors that make species vulnerable to climate change is a key to conserving biodiversity, Wolf said, adding that deserts are places where warming and drying is progressing rapidly and animals there are often pushed to their physiological limits.

The Mojave Desert is a place where animal behavior and activity are sharply constrained by the climate. The research shows that individual exposure to challenging conditions varies among animal groups with birds experiencing microclimates where their cooling costs are much greater than those experienced by small mammals. This provides insight into the continued trajectory of mammal and bird populations with the physiological challenges of birds continuing to increase greatly and mammals seemingly buffered from the changes due to their ability to escape the heat in burrows underground and their nocturnal lifestyle.

A decline in the bird species population doesn’t bode ill just for the birds.

“This research draws attention to where our conservation concerns need to be directed currently ̶ toward birds. Because birds provide a variety of ecosystem services such as being seed dispersers, pollinators, and insect predators, we need to consider how bird declines affect overall ecosystem health,” Wolf pointed out.

Preventing the collapse of these bird species is “not likely in the near term” unless carbon dioxide emissions are sharply reduced, Wolf warned.

“Hopefully conservation managers can use these data and models to inform their efforts. Our approach, using the modelling of physiological requirements to climate change and linking this to changes in populations, provides a nice model for future research and shows the importance of understanding how animals work and how environments challenge them,” he summarized.

Increase Your Blood FlowThere is no specific exercise that improves brain health.
And from a psychological standpoint, feeling confident that exercise helps also can ease depression.
Exercise Helps the Gut, TooRegular exercise also can help improve the diversity and health of the bacteria in the intestines.
This group of bacteria, known as the gut microbiome, plays a big role in our overall health and well-being, along with our brain health.","increase, system, blood, brain, health, sweat, boost, increases, stress, gut, exercise, helps, break",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Exercise is good for your heart, and it also can lower blood pressure, prevent diabetes and help you lose weight. But did you know it’s good for your brain, too? When you exercise, your cerebral blood flow increases and helps protect against age-related loss of grey matter. And because physical activity also lowers resting cortisol levels over time, you’re better able to manage stress and prevent cognitive decline — possibly lowering the risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia.

The benefits of exercise don’t stop there: It also boosts attention, memory and comprehension, essentially improving the brain’s ability to learn. Research shows this occurs in several ways, including increased hippocampal volume, increased cortical thickness and improved neuroplasticity.

You can maximize these benefits by combining a fitness routine with appropriate fiber intake, which improves gut health. Remember, the gut is often referred to as the “second brain” and plays a major role in stress, inflammation, depression and anxiety.

Increase Your Blood Flow

There is no specific exercise that improves brain health. The key is just to get moving. But studies have found that compound movements -- such as squats and deadlifts -- involving larger muscle groups result in bigger increases in hormone release afterward. And using larger muscle groups will tax the cardiovascular system more as well, causing a higher increase in heart rate, respiration and cerebral blood flow. Some studies show that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve cerebral blood flow more than lower-intensity steady state cardio.

Exercise Reduces Depression and Anxiety

An overwhelming body of research shows exercise is one of the best antidotes to anxiety and depression. It increases the production of endorphins and leads to an increase in other feel-good chemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine. Another theory suggests that an increase in the temperature of the brain stem from exercise leads to relaxation and less anxiety. And from a psychological standpoint, feeling confident that exercise helps also can ease depression.

Another mechanism that helps the body handle stress is the production of heat shock proteins. These proteins, produced in response to heat stress and exercise, confer a robust stress-resiliency to cells, leading to the body’s improved ability to handle physiological stress.

Exercise Helps the Gut, Too

Regular exercise also can help improve the diversity and health of the bacteria in the intestines. This group of bacteria, known as the gut microbiome, plays a big role in our overall health and well-being, along with our brain health. Our intestines produce more than 90 percent of the serotonin in our bodies, so if we have an imbalanced or homogenous microbiome, our physical and mental health can suffer. Because the gut has its own nervous system, separate from the central nervous system, we’ve come to recognize the gut as our “second brain.” It’s important that we learn how to properly take care of both of our brains so they can better take care of us."

Increases in day-to-day temperature variability from one year to the next inhibit economic growth, according to a new study.
Having experience with swings of temperature between seasons seems to lend economies some resilience to day-to-day temperature variability.
“Surprisingly this has been a fairly under-studied aspect of climate change,” Kotz says.
“Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth.” Nature Climate Change 2021.","growth, erratic, inhibits, climate, economic, weather, variability, change, temperature, daytoday, researchers, average, kotz",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Weather extremes can pack an economic wallop – as seen with last week’s frigid weather in Texas and other weather disasters over the past several years. But subtler forms of unpredictable weather can also have economic effects. Increases in day-to-day temperature variability from one year to the next inhibit economic growth, according to a new study.

“This is another important demonstration that climate is important for the economy and that climate change should therefore be taken seriously by those who are concerned about the economy,” says Maximilian Kotz, a graduate student at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and lead author of the study.

The finding rests on 40 years’ worth of data. Kotz and his colleagues gathered temperature and precipitation measurements for locations around the world from 1979-2018. They calculated how each day’s temperature differed from that month’s average, then averaged the monthly temperature variation across the year. In essence, this provides a picture of when and how much temperatures diverge from seasonal expectations.

The researchers paired these climate figures with economic data from 1,537 regions (states, provinces, or the equivalent) in 76 countries – 29,000 comparisons in all. What they found is a new twist on the old observation that markets hate uncertainty: Each extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability reduces regional growth rates by five percentage points on average, the researchers report in Nature Climate Change.

The pattern is seen across economic sectors – agriculture, manufacturing, and services – and can’t be explained by annual average temperature, precipitation, or the number of extra hot days, the researchers say.

Having experience with swings of temperature between seasons seems to lend economies some resilience to day-to-day temperature variability. For example, economic losses from an extra degree Celsius of temperature variability can be more than 10 percentage points in Colombia or Indonesia, and as little as 3 percentage points in Russia and northern Canada.

Wealth provides some buffer, too. “Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally larger for regions in low-income nations compared with those in higher-income nations, with the difference being more pronounced in higher-latitude countries,” the researchers write.

Until now, most research on climate and economic impacts has looked at annual average temperature and the number of heat stress days. The new study suggests an additional source of climate vulnerability – one that falls most heavily on low-income, tropical nations that are already known to be more affected by other sources of climate stress and one that could therefore increase global inequality.

It’s not yet clear whether day-to-day temperature variability is likely to increase with climate change. “Surprisingly this has been a fairly under-studied aspect of climate change,” Kotz says. “Our current work shows that addressing this question is of vital importan[ce] to understanding the costs of climate change.” The team has been working on this analysis, he adds, and aims to publish their findings soon.

Protective measures

Temperature rise due to climate change has negatively affected labour productivity in the country in recent decades and will keep damaging it, potentially to a higher extent than what has been estimated until now, the authors found.

A future scenario with severe climate change will see a reduction of per capita GDP of up to 20% by the end of the century compared to an idealised future without the impacts of a changing climate.

Retha Louw is the chief executive of the Sustainability Initiative of South Africa (Siza) which works with the agricultural sector to ensure ethical and environmentally sustainable trade.

“For the producers who are part of the programme, looking towards audit outcomes and results, it’s clear that hats and sunscreen lotion are becoming part of personal protective equipment. It is not compulsory but as an example, it is becoming part of the risk analysis of a farm,” she says.

“Agri-workers start earlier in the mornings to avoid the heat – again, legislation and the Siza standard make provision to monitor working hours, no matter when they start or when they work. If they work a night shift there is legislation included in the Siza standard to allow for a night shift allowance and the same is relevant to day shifts.”

A decade ago, a pilot study for the high occupational temperature health and productivity suppression programme showed how particularly in Upington, where daily maximum temperatures may reach more than 40°C, workers reported a wide range of heat-related effects, including sunburn, sleeplessness, irritability, and exhaustion leading to difficulty in maintaining work levels and output during very hot weather.

Billions will be lost

The study found that few, if any, measures were being undertaken by employers to protect health or improve worker comfort.

In 2019, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) concluded that by 2030 the equivalent of more than 2% of total working hours worldwide is projected to be lost every year, either because it is too hot to work or because workers have to work at a slower pace. This is a loss equivalent to 80 million full-time jobs and with global economic losses of US$2 400 billion, according to the ILO report Working on a Warmer Planet: The Impact of Heat Stress on Labour Productivity and Decent Work.

This is a conservative estimate because it assumes that the global mean temperature rise will not exceed 1.5°C and that work in agriculture and construction – two of the sectors worst affected by heat stress – are carried out in the shade.

Lower-middle- and low-income countries are expected to suffer the most as they have fewer resources to adapt effectively to increased heat and higher rates of working poverty, informal and vulnerable employment, subsistence agriculture, and a lack of social protection.

Caradee Wright, a senior specialist scientist in the environment and health research unit at the Medical Research Council, says employers need to be more aware of temperature and sun exposure health risks — and how such risks affect productivity. “For sun exposure, there is no legislation or guideline in South Africa to protect against ocular and skin exposure, for example against sunburn, skin cancer and cataracts,” she says.

Wright says Australia, the UK and the US have such legislation and guidelines.

“Germany has made keratinocyte cancer an occupational disease, which can be claimed against if found to be from occupational exposure. For heat exposure, there is a bunch of stuff done for underground mining … but nothing for ambient exposure on the surface, as far as I know,” she says.

Wright says it would be difficult to have laws or rules to enforce not working when certain temperatures are reached, especially if they are likely to occur more often with climate change and global warming, as is happening in South Africa.

“That said, something has to be done.”

Anecdotally, Wright reports having seen road construction workers wearing helmets with side flaps and sunglasses and the use of gazebos for construction workers.

“But this is not the norm. In Japan, all of this type of work is done at night. Partly because it is quieter and I am sure also because it is cooler and [with] less sun exposure.”

Increasing risk

A 2014 study, Climate change and occupational health: A South African perspective, found how climate change, and with it the predicted higher temperatures, changes in rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather conditions, will create increased health risks in many workplaces.

“In South Africa, and many other parts of the world experiencing a hot season each year, the effects of heat stress may be of greatest relevance to the large working populations in mining, agriculture, construction, quarries and outdoor services. Factory and workshop heat will also become an increasing problem in the numerous workplaces without effective cooling systems.”

Climate model trends for this century indicate that the heat exposure may increase by 2 — 4°C during the hottest months, “and this would change the occupational heat situation from ‘low risk’ to ‘moderate or high risk’ in much of SA”, according to the study.

Leon de Beer, the general manager of the National Wool Growers’ Association of South Africa, says wool sheep producers in very hot and dry areas allow for breaks when temperatures are at their highest.

“Mechanisation, however is another option, with the negative impact this will consequently have on jobs.”

The national department of health’s draft national heat-health action guidelines describe ignorance of the dangers of heat as one of the major challenges to preventing heat-related diseases in the workplace.

Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, employers are responsible for ensuring that an employee is protected against high temperatures and related exposures.

Measures could include adjusting working hours to start earlier in the day, lengthening break times, and protection against direct sunlight, such as through exterior shaded areas or an indoor ‘cool space’."

The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) predicts we will see a 3.7°C increase in average global temperature by the end of this century (plus or minus 1.1°C) and we have already experienced a 1°C rise since 1880.

A team from the University of Melbourne is studying what makes some plants more able to cope with extreme heat, with the aim of developing new plant varieties that are resilient to heat stress.

""When we consider that we get most of our food, fiber and shelter from plants, it's clear that helping them adapt to increasing temperatures is vital,"" says Professor Prem Bhalla from the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences.

""We know that increased temperature during particular stages of plant growth negatively affects plant development, and that this can lead to a loss in crop productivity and yield,"" says Professor Bhalla.

""But to help plants adapt to higher temperatures, we need to go right back to the start, to understand which genes are involved in the first stages of both positive and negative responses to extreme heat.""

The research team, that also includes Ph.D. candidate Neeta Lohani and Professor Mohan Singh studied the effect of extreme heat on canola, Australia's third largest broadacre (large-scale) crop and one of significant economic importance. About 25 percent of Australia's canola oil is exported.

""Known as rapeseed in the US, the the rising demand for canola oil for human consumption, industrial uses and bio-diesel production has led to a continuous expansion of its cultivation to drier regions, further increasing exposure to unfavorable weather events,"" Professor Bhalla says.

""Previous research has shown that the critical temperature for canola growth in field conditions ranges between 27 to 30°C,"" she says.

""High temperatures of above 32°C have been shown to particularly affect plant sexual reproduction.""

During this type of reproduction, pollen is carried by insects or blown by the wind from one flower to another in a process called pollination. The pollen reaches a flower and produces a tube that transports sperm to the ovary, fertilizing the egg cells (ovules) and ultimately resulting in seeds.

Extreme heat at the time of flowering can seriously reduce plant fertility by impairing pollen development and reducing the receptivity of stigma—the female part through which the pollen tube penetrates and transfers the sperm for fertilization and seed set.

The reduction in seed yield is a significant issue for canola croppers as the oil is extracted from mature seeds.

""While high temperature is expected to affect both male and female reproductive tissues simultaneously, the basis of heat stress response in the female reproductive tissues remains largely unknown,"" explains Professor Bhalla.

""To address this gap in our understanding, we used growth chambers to mimic a heatwave, exposing canola plants to both 30 minutes and four hours at 40°C.""

The team studied Brassica napus L., a variety of canola that is the third most important oilseed crop produced globally.

""The plants exposed to four hours of extreme heat were used to understand the effects of heat on the plant's physiology, and the 30 minute heat-exposed plants were incorporated into genetic studies,"" Professor Bhalla says.

Now published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, the findings show that exposure to the four hours of high temperature drastically reduced the pollen survival (known as viability) to approximately 25 percent, down from 90 percent, and also reduced pollen germination (the ability to produce a pollen tube to transfer sperm) to around 10 percent, down from 62 percent.

In comparison, the canola plants that weren't exposed to extreme heat had approximately 90 percent pollen viability and 62 percent germination.

When heat stressed pistils (female sexual organs) were pollinated with heat-stressed pollen, the team also saw a drastic reduction in seed germination, the growth of a seedling.

This failed fertilization and seed set indicates heat-induced changes in the female sexual organs are likely to exert considerable influence over the performance of pollen (the male reproductive counterpart) and ultimately the overall seed yield.

Next, genetic material was extracted from both the male and female reproductive tissues.

In pollen, down regulation—or reduced number of gene products—from genes known to be associated with cell wall organization and cellular transport appear to be associated with reduced pollen health and integrity, leading to reduced reproductive success and seed set.

Gene expression in the female sexual organs was also found to be affected in what appears to be a stress-induced response to heat.

""The impact of changing the activity of these genes isn't well understood yet, but we do know that some of the genes are involved in heat and drought tolerance in other plants such as maize and tomato. Further studies are needed, but the goal is to breed this same tolerance into commercial canola plants,"" says Professor Bhalla.

""Our results show that short episodes of high-temperature exposure in canola affect some key pathways that regulate genetic activity, as well as disrupting reproductive processes, ultimately translating to yield loss.""

Further investigations into the genes and networks identified in this study are planned, paving the way towards the genetic improvement of heat tolerance and reproductive performance of important canola varieties.

While Black children make up 16% of all US public school students, more than a quarter of them attend the schools worst affected by air pollution, one 2018 study found.
High levels of air pollution, such as the ozone spurred by increasing heat, is stoking allergies and asthma in young children of color, research has found.
Black children are now twice as likely to be hospitalized and four times as likely to die from asthma as white children.
“It’s only a matter of time before we start seeing more and more health problems in children,” said Pacheco.","black, american, children, effects, white, shandas, students, young, research, lifealtering, having, color, heat, likely",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Joe Biden has vowed to uproot what he describes as the systemic racism that has caused certain communities “disproportionate harm from climate change and environmental contaminants for decades”.

The need for this is increasingly clear. The roots of systemic racism run so stubbornly deep in the US, recent research has revealed, that global heating harms Black and Latino children before they are even born, as well as in the first years of their lives.

“Unfortunately many children will be marked for life because of what their mothers are exposed to, affecting the brain, lungs, pancreas, everything,” said Susan Pacheco, an associate professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center who co-authored research released last summer that found that pregnant women exposed to heat and air pollution are at heightened risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The analysis of dozens of medical studies found women of color, particularly Black women, and their babies are most likely to suffer low birth weights, pre-term births and stillbirths from climate-driven threats. Hot temperatures can cause strain upon women and their unborn children, while heat can also react with pollutants from cars and power plants to create ozone, a ground-level pollutant that can cause an array of health problems.

“This pollution cause placental inflammation and affects the baby,” said Pacheco. “This can cause impacts in childhood but also bad outcomes when they are adults, such as heart and kidney disease. Even what we would consider limited exposures can affect the development of the baby.”

The climate crisis is shaping the lives of Black children and children of color before they take their first breath, but it doesn’t stop there. Once a Black or Latino child is born, there is a good chance they will live in a neighborhood that gets even hotter than nearby, whiter suburbs. Researchers have found that in US cities including New York, Dallas and Miami, poorer areas with more residents of color can be get up to 20F hotter in summer than wealthier, whiter districts in the same city.

Mothers here in Texas tell me they don’t know what to do because they can’t let their kids outside in summer Susan Pacheco

This is largely because less affluent neighborhoods of color have far fewer green spaces or tree-lined streets to provide a cool respite on scorching hot days. A young Black child will instead probably be taking their first steps in a neighborhood largely covered in paved surfaces, such as asphalt, that soaks up and radiates heat on sunny days. “Mothers here in Texas tell me they don’t know what to do because they can’t let their kids outside in summer,” said Pacheco. “The heat is relentless.”

Prolonged exposure to heat can increase levels of stress and have various impacts on the body, said Vivek Shandas, an expert in urban studies at Portland State University who co-authored a paper on how neighborhood demographics relate to city heat. “You then find the majority of people who pass away in heatwaves are communities of color,” he said. “There’s a direct relationship.”

This heat disparity between poor, Black neighborhoods and rich, white ones is no accident. Shandas and his fellow researchers found the hottest areas today overlap with places that were historically redlined – a practice dating back to the 1930s when the federal government rated the risk of different neighborhoods for real estate development. Race played a major role, with Black areas routinely deemed “hazardous” and barred from federally backed mortgages and other investments, causing them to be deprived of amenities in comparison with green-lined white, wealthy areas.

“This means the modern experience of what your life is like is in many respects nothing to do with you, it’s down to something that happened a long time ago with acts of segregation that were codified through planning policies,” said Shandas. “These systemic biases have created landscapes of precarity for communities of color and low-income communities.”

Many young people of color growing up in such neighborhoods are unaware of the differing vulnerabilities to global heating, according to Shandas, who recounted an experiment in which high schoolers in Yonkers, New York, and Austin, Texas, were given infrared cameras that can measure temperature and asked to take pictures of their surroundings. “The students took the photos and noticed some neighborhoods were hotter than others,” Shandas said. “It showed their lived experience. It went from a climate issue to a justice issue for them.”

As the planet bakes, the situation is expected to become more extreme. Within 30 years, US counties with large Black populations will face an average of 22 more extreme heat days each year than counties with small Black populations, according to a Union of Concerned Scientists analysis.

For a young child of color, there is a little escape. At home, research has shown Black households are less than half as likely as white households to have central air conditioning. Meanwhile, at school, Black and Latino students are also suffering from the heat – a study last year of 270m exam scores of US students between the third and eighth grades found that students of color were vastly more likely than white students to experience a dip in academic performance on days when temperatures soared over 80F. More recent research has found that poor air quality, exacerbated by heat, can even affect children’s self-confidence and drive to be successful.

Historically racist planning policies and land value disparities have meant that the homes of many people of color in the US are concentrated near landfills, highways and polluting heavy industry. Black people are 75% more likely to live next to oil and gas facilities that emit large amount of pollution, including planet-warming gases.

The toxic stew that threatens young, developing bodies is formidable, ranging from formaldehyde, which has been linked to cancer, to benzene, linked to brain damage, to soot, linked to higher blood pressure. While Black children make up 16% of all US public school students, more than a quarter of them attend the schools worst affected by air pollution, one 2018 study found.

High levels of air pollution, such as the ozone spurred by increasing heat, is stoking allergies and asthma in young children of color, research has found. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “increases in asthma rates among poor minorities have been even larger than the averages”. Black children are now twice as likely to be hospitalized and four times as likely to die from asthma as white children.

The challenge for Biden, and future administrations, to address this threat will only grow as the climate crisis worsens. “It’s only a matter of time before we start seeing more and more health problems in children,” said Pacheco. “It’s going to be everywhere. This is urgent.”"

She says the first sign that a cow is suffering from heat stress is when it starts to breathe more.
That reduces the metabolic heat that they are producing, but the consequence of that is that they reduce their milk production,” she says.
They are really big animals which means they are producing a lot of heat and have less skin relative to their size to get rid of the heat.
She says planning the day to avoid doing some tasks in the heat of the day is an obvious option.","work, taking, shade, farmers, cows, lot, humans, mcgowan, hot, heat, needs",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"As the hot weather starts to kick in around the country, DairyNZ has put out a special plea to farmers to protect themselves from the heat and also to ensure that their cows are kept cool.

Jacqueline McGowan, who’s an expert in heat stress, says the ways of mitigating the effects of heat are similar for both cows and people – the difference being that cows prefer temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius whereas humans can cope with it being a little warmer – up to 24 degrees.

She says the first sign that a cow is suffering from heat stress is when it starts to breathe more. She says if the cow breathes less than seven times in ten seconds, it is okay, but over ten times, it’s in trouble.

“Unlike humans they can’t sweat all that much and so for evaporative cooling they breath more. They will stand up more, sometimes gather in groups with their heads down, drink more and they will eat less. That reduces the metabolic heat that they are producing, but the consequence of that is that they reduce their milk production,” she says.

McGowan says over the last few decades science has enabled researchers to realise that cows actually feel warm at cooler temperatures than was previously thought. She says a NZ scientist did some research in 2008, which established the temperature humidity index (THI) that shows cows like to access shade that comes at around 64 THI – the equivalent of around to 20 to 21 degrees depending on the humidity.

“A lot of this is related to the biology of the cow. They are really big animals which means they are producing a lot of heat and have less skin relative to their size to get rid of the heat.

“They are also ruminants, so that process of digesting grass produces a lot of heat and then on top of that, like humans, when they are lactating, which means they are running much hotter, they have more metabolic heat to get rid of,” she says.

For cows, seeking shade is their preferred way of keeping cool, but McGowan says on many dairy farms, shade is not as available as it used to be. She notes the advent of pivot irrigators, farmers fencing off bush areas and wetlands have reduced the number of trees in paddocks where cows can seek relief from the hot sun.

“Those farmers that don’t have trees in paddocks will often move their cows to a covered feed pad or maybe a small area of bush.

“They can also take them to the dairy shed and turn on the sprinklers and that will cool them down fast and last for several hours. But the fact is cows prefer shade,” she says.

Human Factors

Jacqueline McGowan, DairyNZ, says obviously more is known about the needs of people in hot weather.

She says a key message to managers is to be respectful in the way that people work and try to accommodate their needs.

""There needs to be clean drinking water in the shed. Some employers are very good to their staff and have snacks and drinks there in a fridge for them. Sunscreen should be available and everyone should wear a hat,"" she says.

Working in the sun can make people tired and irritable says McGowan and having good communication with staff to work out what best suits them and how this can be fitted into the daily routine of the business.

She says planning the day to avoid doing some tasks in the heat of the day is an obvious option.

""Accommodating individuals needs can also make for a positive and good work environment. For example, people with young families like to be home in the early evening while some are happy to take time off during the day and work in the evening,"" she says.

McGowan says the objective should be to devise a system people enjoy and not just work longer in the summer because there are more daylight hours. She says if farmers want more information on this subject they should go to the DairyNZ web site."

This increase can negate efforts to contain global warming if we don’t also implement energy-efficient interventions.","cooling, science, demand, rise, global, emissions, energy, warming, wire, sector, indias, electricity, path, tricky, india, world",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"Photo: brawny/Unsplash.

Cooling is a developmental need in India – a country whose population is going to become increasingly vulnerable to heat stress. So limiting India’s cooling demand and denying cooling access to the people is not an option. However, this inevitable demand could be an opportunity to utilise energy efficiency as a resource and improve access to cooling in a sustainable manner.

In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) announced that to limit global warming to 1.5°C, net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach “net zero” around 2050.

The world emits around 50 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide equivalent) each year, leading to global warming. If these emissions continue unchecked, the average global surface temperature is expected to reach 4.1º-4.8º C above pre-industrial levels. This temperature rise has ecological, physical and health impacts, including heat stress, sea-level rise, altered crop growth and disrupted water systems.

A recent UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report suggests that unless emissions fall by 7.6% each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5º C goal of the Paris Agreement.

Tackling climate change is one of Joe Biden’s four key priorities in his first term as US president; and France, the UK and many other countries have pledged to become net carbon neutral by 2050. However, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), all these pledges (made until November 2020) being fully implemented would still mean surface temperature can rise by 2.1º C by 2100.

Electricity demand in the building sector, driven by cooling systems, specifically in the developing world poses one of the many serious challenges for these countries vis-à-vis reducing power sector emissions. The recent UNEP-IEA Cooling Emissions and Policy Synthesis Report stated that up to 0.4º C of warming could be avoided by 2100 by transitioning to energy-efficient and climate-friendly cooling solutions.

Sectoral contributions

A robust statistical analysis of country-specific sectoral contributions to the global climate problem would perhaps be key to identifying future emission drivers and developing technological and policy solutions. The top 10 sectors contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 (in millions of tonnes of carbon-dioxide-equivalent) are:

The electricity and heating sector worldwide contributes around 30% of total global emissions, driven principally by electricity demand from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) in urban infrastructure. Geographically, the most ‘offending’ of these sectors are those of China and the US.

A recent report from The Economist Intelligence unit projects that the global electricity demand for space-cooling will grow by 6.1% per year until 2030, up to 5,950 TWh. Expanding capacity to meet this demand will contribute around 10.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. China’s electricity and heating sector emissions, driven by HVAC demand, is already the highest polluting sector worldwide. It has also been reporting the fastest growth in energy demand for space cooling in buildings over the last two decades, increasing at 13% per year since 2000.

India’s cooling demand

India’s electricity and heating sector is the seventh highest greenhouse-gas-emitting sector among top 10 polluting sectors, and is steadily rising through the ranks. With increasing population and to achieve better living standards, the demand for electricity and cooling is on the rise in India as well. Considering especially a massive growth in the aspirational middle class, India’s electricity and heating/cooling sector is likely to be the highest emitting sector in the business-as-usual scenario.

From providing thermal comfort in our homes and offices to keeping our food, cars and medicines cool, cooling solutions have increasingly been becoming a necessity.

According to the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP), the aggregated nationwide cooling energy demand (in terms of primary energy) is expected to grow around 2.2 times in 2027, over the 2017 baseline, and the cooling demand in terms of tonnes of refrigeration is expected to grow around 3.1-times in 2027 over the 2017 baseline. This growth also portends a rise in emissions.

Sustainable cooling

Governments around the world must ensure sustainable cooling considerations are included in energy, urban, transport, agricultural and health service projects, among others, and also install policies and regulations to reduce the need for cooling in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. They can encourage manufacturers to improve the energy efficiency of their cooling products and lower the warming potential of refrigerants in line with or exceeding the obligations under the Montreal Protocol. Finally, governments can also institute minimum energy performance standards and labelling schemes for air conditioners.

A challenge in the way of introducing super-efficient cooling products is the initial price hump, which makes them less competitive relative to more prevalent but also more inefficient products. These affordability concerns influence consumer behaviour. The recently released TERI cooling sector perception study shows that over 90% of consumers of cooling products look at the star-rating of the appliance – but the cost almost always wins out. To make the most efficient option the more preferred option, crossing the price-hump is crucial, and the role of business models to reduce costs becomes important.

In this regard, examples of public bulk procurement programmes, like that of Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., are worth emulating. Such programmes leverage economies of scale through demand aggregation and result in significant reduction of the prices of the latest equipment and their availability to the masses.

National synergistic actions

India’s 2021-2022 Economic Survey estimates that India could lose 5.8% of its working hours, equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs in absolute terms, to heat-stress events by 2030. The data suggests a significant growth potential in the penetration of ACs and other cooling services (including cold storage) in India with increasing standard of living. Likewise, the country’s share of the total electricity demand for cooling is expected to increase from 7% in 2020 to almost 20% in 2030.

This increase can negate efforts to contain global warming if we don’t also implement energy-efficient interventions. Proactive policy frameworks like the ICAP and accelerated efficient technology deployment guided by such frameworks will help. Transitioning to climate friendly cooling access would potentially be the best business model for India to build back better and perhaps help in achieving net zero emission goals by the mid-century.

Their work, featured in Nature Energy, proposes a new design method that could make the process of heating and cooling buildings more manageable, less expensive, more efficient, and better prepared to flexibly manage power from renewable energy sources that do not always deliver energy when it is most needed.

The paper, ""Rate Capability and Ragone Plots for Phase Change Thermal Energy Storage,"" was authored by NREL's Jason Woods, along with co-authors Allison Mahvi, Anurag Goyal, Eric Kozubal, Wale Odukomaiya, and Roderick Jackson. The paper describes a new way of optimizing thermal storage devices that mirrors an idea used for batteries, helping to inform what new thermal storage materials are needed for buildings and how the devices should be designed with these materials.

Thermal energy storage allows buildings to function like a huge battery by storing thermal energy in novel materials until it can be used later. One example is a heat pump. While electricity is needed initially to create and store the heat, the heat is used later without using additional electricity.

In another example, some materials have the ability to change phases, like ice that can transition from a solid to a liquid. As the ice melts, it absorbs energy from and cools a working fluid, which can then be used to cool a building space. Because phase change occurs at a nearly constant temperature, useful energy can be provided or stored for a longer period at a steady temperature. Thermal energy storage is typically very ""round trip"" energy efficient.

The authors discovered that a Ragone plot, often used to characterize batteries, also works well to describe the potential effectiveness of various thermal storage device candidates. A Ragone plot shows the tradeoff between how much energy a device can store and its discharge power, or how quickly the device can release energy. This foundational approach makes comparisons between different thermal storage materials or device improvements easier to evaluate. It serves as a starting point for defining targets and is a useful design tool to develop new thermal storage materials and devices that can serve as novel, alternative energy storage options.

""This Ragone framework ensures cost-effective design of thermal storage materials and devices depending on the power and energy requirements of a particular application,"" said Jason Woods, a senior research engineer at NREL and lead author of the newly published paper.

Mahvi, a postdoctoral researcher at NREL, said another advantage is enabling technologies that can mitigate blackouts on the grid. ""Most of peak electricity demand -- especially in the summer when you might see blackouts -- is driven by air conditioning. If you can move that demand to some other time of the day, you can help alleviate the strain on the grid, keeping the grid operational, but also keeping people indoors comfortable.""

""Thermal energy storage systems will need to become more flexible and adaptable with the addition of onsite power generation, electric vehicle charging, and the combination of thermal storage with batteries,"" Woods said. ""Part of this flexibility requires higher power -- but this higher power comes at a cost of available energy, as this publication highlights.""

The way in which the thermal energy storage is used will impact its performance. Scientists need to consider questions about how stored energy can best be used to keep building occupants comfortable, or for different applications like maintaining electronic equipment at a safe temperature.

""Which one works best for me and my application will depend on what the requirements are. How much do I need to store, and how fast do I need to discharge it?"" Mahvi said. ""This framework will allow us to optimize thermal storage systems from the material to the component scale to increase the power density while still accessing as much of the available capacity as possible. This will result in more efficient devices that can be used for a wide range of applications.""

The researchers developed a computer model to understand the various design tradeoffs with these thermal storage devices, including ones that require high power (release the energy quickly) and low power (release the energy slowly). They also built a prototype phase change thermal storage device, illustrating this power-energy tradeoff in practice.

Yet others feel a burning sensation in their upper back due to:

Back pain is a common complaint in the United States, and a top reason for doctor visits and missing days from work. Some people have aches that are either:

Upper back pain can even limit your range of motion and mobility.

Other symptoms can accompany a burning sensation in your upper back too. You might also experience neck pain, or pain that radiates to:

A burning pain is different from other types of back pain . Some people describe it as a prickly, stinging sensation, or an electrical shock felt between your shoulder blades or on the right or left side of your spine.

Here’s a look at a few common causes of a burning, stinging sensation in your upper back.

1. Stress

Different factors can trigger stress such as:

work

family

health

financial pressure

But stress doesn’t only cause emotional distress, it can also affect you physically.

Some people get headaches when they’re stressed, and other people experience back pain.

Stress can also cause muscle tension. This can lead to a constant ache or burning sensation between your shoulder blades and around your neck.

2. Muscle strain

A back injury or overuse of back muscles can also cause a burning, stinging sensation in your upper back. This can happen after:

lifting heavy objects

sudden movements

exercise

playing sports

other back injuries

Muscle strains can occur anywhere in your back, such as between your shoulder blades or on the right or left side of your spine.

Sometimes, a muscle strain can radiate to your chest. This type of pain often develops after a back injury or other strenuous activity, and symptoms might worsen with repeated strain.

3. Spinal misalignment

Spinal misalignment are another possible cause of a burning, stinging sensation in your upper back. Factors contributing to spinal misalignment include:

an injury like a fall or car accident

improper posture

sleeping in an incorrect position

repetitive motions

You may feel pain from spinal misalignment in between your shoulder blades or neck.

4. Herniated disc

Discs are rubbery cushions in between your vertebrae (bones) in your spine. These discs become herniated when they move out of position and compress a nerve.

Pain is typically in your lower back, but you can also feel it in your upper back. You can feel pain on the right or left side of your back and a burning sensation around your neck too.

You might have other symptoms too, like muscle weakness and muscle spasms. Some herniated discs occur after trauma like:

a fall

an accident

moving the wrong way

But herniated discs can also develop for no apparent reason due to age and wear and tear.

5. Rheumatic conditions

The following rheumatic conditions can affect your back pain:

arthritis

osteoarthritis

lupus

polymyalgia rheumatica

Other auto-inflammatory diseases can affect your:

joints

tendons

muscles

bones throughout your body — including your back

An overactive immune system triggers the above conditions. In this case, the immune system mistakenly targets the body’s healthy tissue, which causes a chronic inflammatory response.

Inflammation can cause stabbing, sharp pains, as well as a burning sensation on the right or left side of your upper back, and between your shoulder blades.

6. Bone spurs

These are bony growths that form on a bone’s edge due to joint damage. Bone spurs on your spine can compress nerves. These spurs cause the following experiences to occur in your upper back:

weakness

numbness

a burning sensation

Bone spurs on your spine can also cause neck pain and chest pain.

7. Spinal stenosis

Spinal stenosis is narrowing of your spinal canal, or the spaces within your spine. This narrowing also places pressure on nerves, causing back pain. Spinal stenosis often causes upper back and neck pain that radiates to your chest.

8. Spinal tumors

Tumors that develop on your spine can also cause a stinging, burning sensation in your upper back between your shoulder blades. Depending on the location of a tumor, you might also feel pain in your neck.

Spinal tumors can be malignant or benign, and cause other symptoms too. These include:"

“Obviously, climate change is not something that’s off in the future, but something that we’re dealing with and the components of our natural environment are dealing with right now,” Unitt said.","underground, mammals, birds, species, change, climate, different, museum, survive, study, san, hargrove, natural, desert",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"In the struggle to survive the ever hotter deserts of California, there are winners and losers.

Among the losers are desert birds, whose populations have collapsed amid the heat stress of climate change. The winners, it turns out, are small burrowing mammals, including the cactus mouse, kangaroo rat and white-tailed antelope squirrel, which take refuge from the sun underground.

Researchers, including scientists from the San Diego Natural History Museum, published those results in the journal Science this month, noting that the stable mammal populations formed a hopeful contrast to the dire condition of birds.

“Why was the mammal community relatively stable compared to the bird community?” asked study co-author Lori Hargrove, an ecologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. “Birds had a higher evaporative heat loss. Birds were more exposed to the effects of warming, so they had higher energy costs to maintain their body temperature, whereas mammals were able to buffer their body temperature by using burrows during the day.”

Temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit on average across the area studied, she said, but the heat affects birds and small mammals differently. As part of the study, scientists modeled each species’ body temperature and cooling needs under different desert conditions. To calculate that, they measured the conductivity of the animals’ fur or feathers, and used information on their heat reducing behaviors, such as evaporative cooling or denning underground.

The models showed that in the fight against climate change, there is not a level playing field for furred and feathered desert dwellers. Cooling costs — or the resources needed to maintain stable body temperature — were about 3.3 times higher for birds than they were for small mammals, the study reported. Rising temperatures resulting from climate change increased cooling costs by 58% for birds, but only 17% for mammals, it said.

“Mammals have shown this remarkable stability,” said study senior author Steven Beissinger, a professor of environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley and researcher at its Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. “It’s really quite interesting that, in the same region, with the same level of climate change, these two very similar taxa have responded very differently to the changes taking place.”

The study relied on data that scientists gleaned during years spent retracing historic surveys of California’s deserts and mountains, and measuring ecological changes over the last century. The Grinnell Resurvey Project, a joint effort of UC Berkeley, the Natural History Museum and other institutions, has painstakingly followed the footsteps of Joseph Grinnell, the first director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley, as he and his team walked sweeping transects across the state.

Starting in 2008, scientists trekked through the San Jacinto Mountains and other Southern California wildlands to examine the exact sites that Grinnell studied a century earlier. Current researchers relied on Grinnell’s extensive field notes, hand-drawn sketches and maps to chronicle the status of plants and animals that his team cataloged in the early 1900s. Whenever possible, Hargrove took photos in the precise locations that the original team visited.

“Exactly 100 years later, we retraced his steps in the San Jacinto Mountains to see how the ecosystem has changed,” Hargrove said. “Then we extended his work to Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve. We couldn’t do that without the work of the early 20th century zoologists who surveyed the fauna of California with [an eye to] what they thought would change because of humans and development.”

The San Jacinto Mountains above Idyllwild are seen in a historical photo from the Grinnell survey of California’s landscape in 1908 (Joseph Grinnell, left) and a contemporary photo from a resurvey of the same sites in 2010 (Lori Hargrove, right). (UC Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology; San Diego Natural History Museum.)

Grinnell was prescient about the need to document natural conditions before humans altered them, but he couldn’t have anticipated the extent of the transformation to California’s landscape.

“They wanted to document the fauna before it changed,” Hargrove said. “Now we also have climate change.”

The granular, detailed observations of habitats and wildlife has allowed researchers to observe broad trends, such as the well-being of mammals versus birds noted in the recent survey. But it also helps them spot the outliers: individual species faring better or worse than others.

For instance, while most species of rodents were stable, chipmunks that were common in Joshua Tree National Park in the 1940s had nearly disappeared when the team surveyed the park, said Phil Unitt, curator of birds and mammals for the Natural History Museum. That made sense as these tree dwellers are active in daytime and scramble around branches like birds, rather than burrowing underground in the heat of the day, he said.

By contrast, the California Towhee, a chaparral bird, had spread more widely across the park, even as others — such as the mountain quail, titmouse, black-chinned sparrow and gray vireo — have declined.

“So why that species alone, when all these other chaparral birds had done so poorly?” Unitt asked. “It’s always interesting when we find counter examples as well. Why is some species bucking the trend? To me, that’s the most interesting thing in science, when you observe things that seem contradictory, because then you know there’s some richer story going on behind.”

While most parts of the region got hotter and drier, a few pockets of Mojave National Preserve have curiously become wetter, Hargrove said.

“In those cases, we actually saw increases in Joshua trees, and grass and shrubs and cover, and local increases in bird and mammal communities,” she said.

Insights into the status of different species can help scientists and land managers take steps to protect them, such as increasing fire prevention in fragile high desert areas, managing water use to preserve natural springs, and enhancing water sources in those areas, Hargrove and Unitt said. The study also demonstrates that climate change is already reshaping the California desert.

“Obviously, climate change is not something that’s off in the future, but something that we’re dealing with and the components of our natural environment are dealing with right now,” Unitt said.

Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, and other cities in California have similar bans on natural gas use in new construction.
In 2019, Puget Sound Energy, the state’s largest utility with 1 million electricity customers and 850,000 natural gas customers, helped block a Seattle City Council proposal to ban natural gas use in new buildings.
The Bellevue-based utility has 150,000 gas customers in Seattle, while electricity in the city is provided by city-owned Seattle City Light.
On Jan. 21, Puget Sound Energy announced an “aspirational goal” to reduce net emissions from its natural gas sales 30% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2045.","buildings, city, sound, seattle, puget, energy, state, code, natural, bans, gas",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"The city of Seattle has banned most uses of fossil fuels in new buildings.

The ban on appliances like gas furnaces and gas water heaters in new construction is part of a revised energy code that applies to commercial buildings and to multifamily housing at least four stories tall. The code proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan passed Seattle City Council 9-0 on Monday. Space heating in new construction must be all-electric by June 1, while new water heaters must use only electricity by the end of the year. Gas cooking is still allowed under the city’s new energy code. “Public health can’t wait,” physician Annemarie Dooley of Seattle testified before the City Council. “Every day we delay means more illness and lives lost from air pollution and climate-related heat stress.”

The Washington State Legislature is considering a similar but much slower action on natural gas in commercial buildings, with a ban to take effect in nine years. Natural gas is mostly methane, which is exceptionally powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Seattle’s new energy code also requires large buildings to have more energy-efficient windows, insulation, lighting, and ventilation systems than the state requires. State law prohibits Washington cities from imposing tighter energy codes on residential buildings less than four stories tall. Energy use in buildings is the fastest-growing source of climate pollution in Washington state. Space heating and water heating are the biggest energy hogs in a typical building.

According to Seattle’s latest inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, air travel was the city’s fastest-growing source of carbon pollution in 2018, followed by buildings. Activists, builders and others spoke in favor of Seattle’s fast-track move toward all-electric buildings. “Our building emissions have continued to rise even as the city tries to make investments in mitigating climate change,” said activist Deepa Sivarajan with the nonprofit Climate Solutions. Only fireplace seller Steve Tate with Fireside Home Solutions spoke against the measure. “The desire to sit by a fire isn’t going to go away,” he said.

Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, and other cities in California have similar bans on natural gas use in new construction. Puget Sound Energy and other gas utilities in the Northwest launched a $1 million “Partners for Energy Progress” lobbying campaign in 2020 to defend the industry against similar proposals, as the Seattle Times first reported. In 2019, Puget Sound Energy, the state’s largest utility with 1 million electricity customers and 850,000 natural gas customers, helped block a Seattle City Council proposal to ban natural gas use in new buildings. The Bellevue-based utility has 150,000 gas customers in Seattle, while electricity in the city is provided by city-owned Seattle City Light. Puget Sound Energy did not testify Monday on Seattle’s energy code.

“As an energy delivery company, PSE is fuel-neutral,” spokesperson Andrew Padula said in an email when asked for a reaction to the new code. He said Puget Sound Energy supports the development of biogas and hydrogen fuel, both of which could be delivered through existing gas pipelines. On Jan. 21, Puget Sound Energy announced an “aspirational goal” to reduce net emissions from its natural gas sales 30% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2045. The next day, Puget Sound Energy lobbyist Janet Kelly testified in Olympia against the proposed statewide ban in 2030 on installing gas heat in new buildings. “Electrification is not the only way to accomplish greenhouse gas reductions,” she told the House Environment & Energy Committee."

A wet bulb temperature of 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is considered to be the point when labor becomes unsafe, and 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is the limit to human survivability -- when the body can no longer cool itself.
""Even at 1.5 degrees, South Asia will have serious consequences in terms of heat stress,"" Ashfaq said.

But a new study projecting the amount of heat stress residents of the region will experience in the future finds with 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the population's exposure to heat stress will nearly triple.

Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will likely reduce that impact by half, but deadly heat stress will become commonplace across South Asia, according to the new study in Geophysical Research Letters, AGU's journal publishing high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences.

With almost one quarter of the world's population living in South Asia, the new study underlines the urgency of addressing climate change.

""The future looks bad for South Asia, but the worst can be avoided by containing warming to as low as possible,"" said Moetasim Ashfaq, a computational climate scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and corresponding author of the new study. ""The need for adaptation over South Asia is today, not in the future. It's not a choice anymore.""

Earth has warmed by 1 degree Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On the current climate trajectory, it may reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in 2040. This deadline leaves little time for South Asian countries to adapt. ""Only half a degree increase from today is going to cause a widespread increase in these events,"" Ashfaq said.

A hot region getting hotter

People living in South Asia are especially vulnerable to deadly heat waves because the area already experiences very hot, humid summers. Much of the population live in densely populated cities without regular access to air conditioning, and about 60% perform agricultural work and can't escape the heat by staying indoors.

In the new study, the researchers used climate simulations and projections of future population growth to estimate the number of people who will experience dangerous levels of heat stress in South Asia at warming levels of 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. They estimated the wet bulb temperature residents will experience, which is similar to the heat index, as it takes into account humidity as well as temperature. A wet bulb temperature of 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is considered to be the point when labor becomes unsafe, and 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is the limit to human survivability -- when the body can no longer cool itself.

Their analysis suggests at 2 degrees of warming, the population's exposure to unsafe labor temperatures will rise more than two-fold, and exposure to lethal temperatures rises 2.7 times, as compared to recent years.

Curbing warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will likely cut that exposure in half, but large numbers of people across South Asia will still experience extreme temperatures. An increase in heat events that create unsafe labor conditions are likely to occur in major crop producing regions in India, such as West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, and in Pakistan in Punjab and Sindh. Coastal regions and urban centers such as Karachi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Peshawar are also likely to be heavily affected, according to the study.

""Even at 1.5 degrees, South Asia will have serious consequences in terms of heat stress,"" Ashfaq said. ""That's why there is a need to radically alter the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions.""

The results differ from a similar study conducted in 2017, which predicted that heat waves of lethal temperatures will occur in South Asia toward the end of the 21st century. The researchers suspect the earlier study is too conservative, as deadly heat waves have already hit the region in the past. In 2015, large parts of Pakistan and India experienced the fifth deadliest heat wave in the recorded history, which caused about 3,500 heat-related deaths.

""A policy framework is very much needed to fight against heat stress and heat wave-related problems,"" said T.V. Lakshmi Kumar, an atmospheric scientist at India's SRM Institute of Science and Technology who was not involved in the work. ""India has already committed to reduce emissions to combat climate change issues.""

But the threat could be halved if the world meets a goal set under the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, researchers said in a study published this week by the American Geophysical Union, an international scientific association.

“The future looks bad for South Asia, but the worst can be avoided by containing warming to as low as possible,” Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate scientist at the U.S.-based Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said in a statement.

Still, with global temperatures already having risen more than 1C, “the need for adaptation over South Asia is today, not in the future. It’s not a choice anymore,” said Ashfaq, the study’s author.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said global climate-heating emissions must fall by about 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, to limit warming to below 2C, the higher temperature goal in the Paris Agreement.

But updated plans to reduce emissions, submitted by at least 75 nations ahead of planned COP26 U.N. climate talks in November, barely made a dent in the huge cuts needed to meet the global climate goals a U.N. report said last month.

The new study used climate simulations and projected population growth to estimate the number of people who could experience dangerous levels of heat stress at warming levels of 1.5C and 2C.

It looked at the predicted “wet bulb temperature”, which accounts for humidity and temperature and aims to more accurately reflects what people experience on a hot day.

Health experts and scientists say that at a wet bulb temperature of 32C labour becomes unsafe and at 35C the body can no longer cool itself.

If warming hits 2C, the number of South Asians exposed to unsafe temperatures could rise two-fold, and nearly three times as many people could face lethal heat, the study said.

In a region home to a quarter of the world’s population that could have a big impact on the ability of workers to produce crops in breadbasket regions such as West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in India and Punjab and Sindh in Pakistan, study authors said.

Workers in increasingly steamy cities such as Karachi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Peshawar could also be affected, particularly as many do not have access to air conditioning, the study noted.

Pakistan and India already experience deadly heatwaves, with one in 2015 causing about 3,500 deaths, the study noted.

""Our results for a business-as-usual pathway indicate that especially in the second half of this century unprecedented super- and ultra-extreme heatwaves will emerge,"" explains George Zittis of The Cyprus Institute, first author of the study. These events will involve excessively high temperatures of up to 56 degrees Celsius and higher in urban settings and could last for multiple weeks, being potentially life-threatening for humans and animals. In the second half of the century, about half of the MENA population or approximately 600 million people could be exposed to such annually recurring extreme weather conditions.

It is expected that in the next 50 years, almost 90 percent of the exposed population in the MENA will live in urban centers, which will need to cope with these societally disruptive weather conditions.

Management strategies to mitigate the heat stress effects

Dr Bruno Silva kicked off the webinar. He is professor of swine nutrition and environmental adaptation at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Having discussed why farm animals in general suffer from heat stress, he touched on a series of measures which can be taken to mitigate the effects of heat stress.

He discussed how to make clever use of the surroundings and environment, water pools, the use of sprinklers and bathing, forced ventilation, evaporative cooling systems, cooling pads and water cooling. He said, “Investing in environmental modifications reduces negative impacts and improves performance. All that will help to mitigate the effect of heat stress, improve the animal’s welfare and of course benefit profitability.”

Nutritional solutions to overcome heat stress

Next speaker was Wim Wanzele, nutritionist at the market support team of Agrifirm. Just like the previous speaker he focused his attention on all farm animal species and he delved into gut health in the context of heat stress. He discussed the effects of heat stress – less meat, less milk, fewer eggs.

Pivotal in his presentation was the question whether a heat stress related decrease in feed intake would be fully responsible for the reduced performance? “The answer is no,” he said, because several things are happening simultaneously.

Management strategies to mitigate the heat stress effects

Dr Bruno Silva kicked off the webinar. He is professor of swine nutrition and environmental adaptation at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Having discussed why farm animals in general suffer from heat stress, he touched on a series of measures which can be taken to mitigate the effects of heat stress.

He discussed how to make clever use of the surroundings and environment, water pools, the use of sprinklers and bathing, forced ventilation, evaporative cooling systems, cooling pads and water cooling. He said, “Investing in environmental modifications reduces negative impacts and improves performance. All that will help to mitigate the effect of heat stress, improve the animal’s welfare and of course benefit profitability.”

Nutritional solutions

Next speaker was Wim Wanzele, nutritionist at the market support team of Agrifirm. Just like the previous speaker he focused his attention on all farm animal species and he delved into gut health in the context of heat stress. He discussed the effects of heat stress – less meat, less milk, fewer eggs.

Pivotal in his presentation was the question whether a heat stress related decrease in feed intake would be fully responsible for the reduced performance? “The answer is no,” he said, because several things are happening simultaneously. Supporting animals is possible through feed formulation he said, and also through the use of specific feed additives.

Manufacturing plants generate about two per cent less revenue for every one degree Celsius rise in annual temperature — the greatest decline being in labour-intensive plants — according to a new research on the effect of heat stress on workers and manufacturing output.

The aim of the study, conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, was to understand and quantify the role of heat stress in mediating the temperature-output relation. This was done using primary and secondary data of worker output of more than 58,000 factories across India.

The research found that there are two channels through which high temperatures affect factory workers; they may produce less while at work and also be absent more often. The two channels were separately identified in workers in three different manufacturing settings: Cloth-weaving, garment-sewing and steel products.

The output of individual workers and teams declined on hot days as well as in weeks with hotter days. The study suggested that heat stress was an important underlying cause for the declines in non-agricultural gross domestic product at high temperatures.

While heat stress is not the sole reason for country-level decreases in output in the manufacturing sector during hot years, it does indicate that this may be a much more important mechanism than previously believed, the study said.

The authors also argued that while the focus of the paper was on Indian manufacturing plants — because heat stress is a universal physiological mechanism — there are implications for any sector where labour is important such as construction or services.

According to Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director, Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago:

The effect of high temperatures on lower crop yields has been previously established. This paper shows that rising temperatures can also hurt economic output in other sectors by reducing the productivity of human labour. The damage is greatest when already warm days become hotter. If India wishes to succeed in becoming a manufacturing powerhouse using cheap labour, we need to think hard about how we can adapt to a hotter world.

He co-authored this study with E Somanathan of Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, Rohini Somanathan of Delhi School of Economics, and Meenu Tewari of University of North Carolina.

For primary data, the study covered three cloth-weaving factories in Surat, six garment factories in the National Capital Region (NCR), and two others in Hyderabad and Chhindwara.

The steel production data was from the rail and structural mill of a large public sector steel plant in Bhilai. The secondary data was used from the Annual Survey of Industries covering the financial years 1998-99 to 2012-13.

While climate control in the workplace mitigates productivity losses, absenteeism still remains high, presumably because workers remain exposed to high temperatures at home and outside. And the fact that climate-control is expensive makes its use limited.

The authors also examined the effect of lagged temperatures on workplace productivity and absenteeism. They found the clearest effects for weaving workers, where an additional day above 35 degrees Celsius in the six preceding days caused a 2.7 per cent decrease in contemporaneous daily output.

The response of workers to incentives was also tested; it was found that monetary disincentives weakened the temperature-absenteeism link.

In the case of garment workers, for example, they are allocated a certain amount of paid leave and the data distinguished paid and unpaid absences for each worker.

“In climate-controlled garment plants in the NCR we find that the number of paid absences increases with both contemporaneous and lagged temperatures but the probability of unpaid leave does not change with temperature,” said the study.

The researchers also surveyed the effects of climate control measures through a survey of 150 plants in the diamond processing industry in Surat. “We found that air-conditioning was selectively used in rooms with activities that are both labour-intensive and critical in determining diamond quality,” it said.

It added that if heat stress plays an important role in reducing output, firms that do make costly climate control investments should strategically allocate these resources towards tasks that are labour-intensive.

Sudarshan added that warm countries in the developing world may face a pervasive heat tax that could damage the competitiveness of their manufacturing sectors and hurt the wages of poor workers.

Research into low-cost technologies to protect workers from ambient temperatures may have significant social value, he said."

But rising temperatures are likely to complicate the picture, researchers report in a new review of the topic.

Published in the Journal of Experimental Botany, the review explores how higher temperatures influence plant growth and viability despite the greater availability of atmospheric CO2, a key component of photosynthesis. Excessive heat can reduce the efficiency of enzymes that drive photosynthesis and can hinder plants’ ability to regulate CO2 uptake and water loss, the researchers write. Structural features can make plants more – or less – susceptible to heat stress. Ecosystem attributes – such as the size and density of plants, the arrangement of leaves on plants or local atmospheric conditions – also influence how heat will affect crop yields.

The review describes the latest scientific efforts to address these challenges.

“It’s important to have an understanding of these issues across scales – from the biochemistry of individual leaves to ecosystem-level influences – in order to really tackle these problems in an informed way,” said lead author Caitlin Moore, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia and an affiliate research fellow at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Moore led the review with Amanda Cavanagh, another U. of I. alumna now at the University of Essex in the U.K.

“Historically, there’s been a lot of focus on rising CO2 and the impact that it has on plants,” said co-author Carl Bernacchi, a professor of plant biology and of crop sciences and an affiliate of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I. “And it is an important factor, because we are changing that carbon dioxide concentration enormously. But it’s a small part of the bigger story. Once you throw changing temperatures into the mix, it completely messes up our understanding of how plants are going to respond.”

“Take Rubisco, the key enzyme that fixes carbon dioxide into sugars, making life on Earth possible,” Cavanagh said. “Rubisco speeds up as the temperature increases, but it’s also prone to making mistakes.”

Instead of fixing carbon dioxide by binding it to sugars, a key step in photosynthesis, Rubisco sometimes fixes oxygen, initiating a different pathway that wastes a plant’s resources. Higher temperatures make this more likely, Cavanagh said. At even higher temperatures, the enzyme will begin to lose its structural integrity, making it ineffective.

Excessive heat can also undermine a plant’s reproductive output. Other heat-sensitive enzymes are essential to the light-harvesting machinery of plants or play a role in moving sugars to different plant tissues, allowing the plant to grow and produce grains or fruits.

“If these little molecular machines are pushed out of the temperature range that’s optimal, then they can’t do their job,” Cavanagh said.

When temperatures rise too high, plant leaves open the pores on their surfaces, called stomata, to cool themselves. Stomata also allow plants to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but when they’re fully open, the leaf can lose too much moisture.

“Temperature affects the atmosphere above the plant,” Moore said. “As the atmosphere heats up, it can hold additional water, so it’s pulling more water from the plants.”

Scientists at Illinois and elsewhere are looking for ways to enhance crop plants’ resilience in the face of these changes. Moore, whose work focuses on ecosystem-scale factors, said new tools that can help screen plants on a large scale are essential to that effort. For example, satellites that can detect changes in chlorophyll fluorescence in plants can indicate whether a crop is under heat stress. These changes in fluorescence are detectable before the plant shows any outward sign of heat stress – such as their leaves turning brown. Developing these tools may enable farmers to respond more quickly to crop stress before too much damage is done.

Cavanagh, who studies the molecular biology and physiology of plants, said some plants are more heat tolerant than others, and scientists are searching their genomes for clues to their success.

“For example, you can look at wild Australian relatives of rice that are growing in much harsher climates than most paddy rices,” she said. “And you see that their enzymes are primed to work more efficiently at hotter temperatures.”

One goal is to transfer heat-tolerant genes to cultivated rice varieties that are more susceptible to heat stress.

Other strategies include engineering structures that pump more CO2 to the site of carbon fixation to improve Rubisco efficiency; altering the light-gathering properties of leaves at the tops and bottoms of plants to even out distribution of sunlight and maintain moisture levels; and changing the density of stomata to improve their control of CO2 influx and moisture loss.

Collaboration between scientists focused on different scales of ecosystem and plant function – from the atmospheric to the molecular – is essential to the success of efforts to build resilience in crop plants, the researchers said.

“The world is getting hotter at a shocking rate,” Cavanagh said. “And we know from global models that each increase in gross temperature degree Celsius can cause 3% to 7% losses in yield of our four main crops. So, it’s not something we can ignore.

“What makes me optimistic is the realization that so much work is going into globally solving this problem,” she said."

Furthermore, East Africa has the highest population growth on the continent, which has been an important driver of demand for livestock products, with future increases anticipated.

Historical change in heat stress for pigs

In the study, the frequency of ‘severe/danger’ heat events (temperatures that will result in significant decreases in productive and reproductive performances) for swine significantly increased from 1981 to 2010. Swine were exposed to severe/danger heat stress for >50% of the year in roughly 44% of East Africa.

Across the region as a whole, the average frequencies of moderate heat-stress conditions (body temperature increases and can negatively impact the livestock’s performance) for swine during the period were approximately 17%. The percentage of days of the year with severe/danger heat-stress conditions for the different livestock categories differed markedly, but swine were the most affected.

Coming up on Wednesday March 24: A webinar on Heat Stress, organised together with All About Feed, featuring Prof Bruno Silva of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil; Wim Wanzele of Agrifirm; and Dr Mohamed Mammeri of Phileo by Lesaffre.

Temperatures will continue to rise

Using a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections for 2021–2050 and 2071–2100, the researchers show that the frequency of dangerous heat-stress conditions and the average number of consecutive days with heat stress events will significantly increase, making much of East Africa unsuitable for exotic pig production.

An alarm bell for policymakers

1 of the researchers, Klaus Butterbach-Bahl at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Kenya, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, said that the results of the study “is an alarm bell for policymakers and anyone involved in livestock in the tropical region”, adding that protein consumption is already low in East Africa and that this could worsen the food and nutrition security situation in the region.

Livestock expert, An Notenbaert, at the Alliance of Bioversity International and International Center for Tropical Agriculture, and co-author of the study, added that the team was surprised by the magnitude of change.

Adapting pigs to local conditions

In intensified systems, exotic or crossbreeds dominate, which are possibly less heat-stress tolerant than locally adapted breeds typically found in the extensive systems. According to the authors, well-targeted and evidence-based climate adaptation will enable livestock production to continue and expand across East Africa. This includes identifying and making available productive animal breeds that are adapted to hotter and more humid climates.

In addition to breeding, countries need to look at other mitigation strategies to increase resilience. This could be in the form of shelters or other means of shading to shield animals and ensuring sufficient water access.

The researchers cautioned that the study only examined the direct consequences of climate change on animals, but that other climate change impacts and climatic parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and rainfall patterns have important direct or indirect influences and also need to be taken into consideration. These include droughts and floods, which can impact feed production, water supply and proliferation of disease and pests.

Largest population of livestock

It is interesting to note that East Africa has the largest population of livestock of all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa, and the livestock sector is an integral part of agricultural systems in the region. Around 70% of agricultural cash income is derived from this sector, contributing 10-15% to national GDP and 20-50% to the total agricultural GDP."

Farmworkers picking and packing strawberries (2019) U.S. Department of Agriculture

As the United States heads into a predicted unseasonably hot spring and summer, our farmworkers deserve to be protected from extreme heat and its dangerous effects. Fortunately there’s a solution that NRDC is supporting: Just reintroduced in Congress, the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act protects workers in high-heat environments with measures such as access to water, paid breaks in shaded environments, and secure protections from employer retaliation. This legislation is an essential first step to protect the nearly 2.4 million hired farmworkers from preventable heat-related injury and death.

An undervalued and vulnerable workforce

Today’s farmworkers still bear the brunt of racist exclusionary policies of the past. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal passed in the 1930s, it notably excluded benefits for agricultural workers. The New Deal was a landmark piece of legislation that granted new workplace rights and protections to many Americans—except farmworkers, many of whom were Black, and in the South—a system established during slavery. Farmworkers were excluded from the New Deal to keep the racist status quo and plantation system that the Southern economy largely depended on, so they did not receive minimum wage, overtime pay, or protections from workplace hazards and retaliation for collective bargaining.

Though the demographic of the farmworker has changed, the exclusionary policies are still in place, and now with the added workplace threats of climate change and extreme weather, that must change. Farmworkers are often seasonal or migrant, and sometimes undocumented, and therefore especially vulnerable to this industry and these health threats. Additionally, farmworkers often face economic hardships and language barriers—leaving some workers almost entirely dependent on employers for food, housing, and protection. They deserve federal workplace protections, which makes this legislation especially valuable.

Heat, a deadly threat to farmworkers

Farming is labor-intensive and dangerous, and increasingly hazardous due to climate change. Layers of clothing to protect from cuts and pesticides and the pay-by-piece employment of many workers amplify the heat-related health outcomes workers face.

Extreme heat harms farmworkers not just in the fields, but also in produce packing sheds and in their living areas. Housing situations for farmworkers can be precarious. For instance, temporary agricultural workers on H2-A visas are at the mercy of their employers, who are supposed to provide housing of at least a minimum safety and quality, but often don’t. For farmworkers who are unable to obtain those visas, low wages and a dearth of affordable options lead to inadequate and unhealthy housing. Some farmworker housing even fails to have air-conditioning, fans, or adequate cooling. Lack of cooling at night to recover from the day’s heat means that some farmworkers could start their workday already experiencing heat stress. This makes it even more important for workers to have protections from extreme heat at work during the day.

A pathway forward to heat protections

Heat-related illness and injuries are entirely preventable. Currently, workplace protections from extreme heat exist in only three states with occupational heat stress safeguards, so safety is dependent upon where workers live. For outdoor workers such as farmworkers, that luck only extends to California and Washington—with only indoor workers protected in Minnesota. Several more states have passed or introduced workplace heat legislation and directives to protect workers from heat. Unfortunately, without federal legislation, farmworkers outside of these states are without protections.

State level heat stress legislation and standards (2021) NRDC

Health and safety protection shouldn’t be dictated by geography. Outdoor and indoor workers alike need federal protections to help keep them safe from the effects of heat.

The Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act is a commonsense, critical first step forward to protect essential outdoor and indoor workers from the health harms of extreme heat. It would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to develop heat stress safeguards that, with proper enforcement, can help prevent further heat-related tragedies. Supported by environmental, labor, faith, health and immigration justice organizations, it recognizes that for farmworkers and other workers impacted by extreme heat, their health, safety, and rights are as important as their essential work."

It’s a hot day on the jobsite and you’re starting to feel lightheaded, overheated or even nauseated. Are you experiencing symptoms of heat stress or is it simply discomfort?

Not all discomfort is a sign of heat-related illness, and heat stress isn’t necessarily caused by personal protective equipment. That’s why it’s important that workers understand their environment, the task at hand and the appropriate fabric to wear. This can help them better evaluate whether something is a comfort issue or a sign of heat stress. Once they know the difference, they can take appropriate steps to amend the situation – whether that means ensuring they’re wearing PPE correctly, choosing different fabrics, or monitoring their well-being and opting for a rest or water break.

Being informed is crucial to protecting lives, so let’s define the difference. Comfort is an inherently subjective characteristic that can’t be effectively measured by lab tests. Heat stress, on the other hand, is a specific and potentially serious illness caused by a series of increasingly dangerous physiological effects resulting from overheating of the body and internal organs. This can be caused by hot and/or humid conditions, sun exposure, a lack of moving air, the intensity of labor and, in some cases, heat-trapping PPE.

Contrary to popular belief, clothing isn’t a significant factor in causing heat-related illnesses. This is true for flame-resistant/arc-rated clothing and non-FR clothing. More often than not, if you’re wearing single-layer, breathable FR clothing and feeling hot, it’s tied to comfort. If you’re wearing multiple layers, there’s more of a risk for heat stress – and wearing fabrics that are breathable and moisture-wicking is key to reducing that risk.

The science behind how our bodies shed heat can help explain. We all have two ways of cooling ourselves: radiation and evaporative cooling. Radiation is the movement of heat from a hotter area (the person) to a cooler area (the atmosphere). Of course, as the ambient temperature approaches that of the person, this ceases to be effective. That’s when evaporative cooling (also known as sweating) kicks in. When sweat is evaporated off your skin, it takes heat with it. As long as the clothing being worn allows radiant heat to escape and sweat to be evaporated, the body’s cooling mechanisms will continue to function as they should.

The science makes it clear: Rather than being a cause of heat stress, FR/AR clothing can actually be part of the solution. With the right fabrics, PPE can not only be standard-compliant, but help you stay cool, comfortable and protected on hot days. Start by specifying light-colored fabric that is designed for the environment and potential hazards at hand. Think short sleeves are the only solution? Think again. Long sleeves are often considered better at preventing heat stress because the sun is a radiant heat load and long sleeves shield the wearer.

If the job requires multiple layers of PPE, look for textiles that are engineered to work together to protect and perform.

Innovation in FR/AR fabrics has advanced far beyond the restrictive options of the past, when PPE was often non-sweat wicking, heavy and inflexible. Today, the significant majority of FR/AR garments made in the United States are virtually indistinguishable from non-FR performance garments in design, style, fit, weight and lasting comfort.

In addition to specifying more breathable, comfortable FR/AR fabrics and ensuring those garments are worn properly, proactively focusing on self-care is critical to preventing heat stress. Monitor your vital signs and sweat levels, take appropriate breaks, find shade when you can, and stay hydrated throughout the day. In fact, the OSHA awareness campaign on heat stress prevention boldly promotes “Water. Rest. Shade.”

Ultimately, if a worker’s PPE is not right for the task or is worn incorrectly – working against them and not for them – they’ll be less likely to wear it. PPE can only protect if it’s worn – and worn properly. Equipping your team with innovative FR/AR garments that are safety standard-compliant and comfortable will not only transform common clothing misconceptions regarding heat stress, but the FR/AR clothing can actually give the wearer a preventive advantage when they need it most.

The researchers used data from around 58,000 factories in India to arrive at the correlation.

With the government’s focus on transforming India into a manufacturing hub, the findings of the paper are significant.

Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director, Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago, said the effect of high temperatures on lower crop yields has been previously established. “This paper shows that rising temperatures can also hurt economic output in other sectors by reducing the productivity of human labour. The damage is greatest when already warm days become hotter,” Sudarshan said in a statement on Thursday.

The statement added if India wishes to succeed in becoming a manufacturing powerhouse using cheap labour, it needs to think hard about how to adapt to a hotter world.

“That 1°C rise over the baseline only puts a number to the possible impact on industrial output. But the effect of this temperature rise is more pronounced when warm days become hotter. So, the rise in average temperatures in [the] summer season directly impacts productivity,” said Sudarshan.

The paper, which has been accepted for publication in the University of Chicago’s Journal of Political Economy, said the losses are mainly due to a reduction in the output elasticity of labour.

Factory workers may produce less while at work due to heat stress and also be absent more often, according to the study.

The analysis of long-term national-level data for the study was supplemented with that on workers involved in cloth weaving, garment sewing, and steel industries to separately identify these two effects. The researchers found the output of individual workers and teams declines on hot days as well as in weeks with more hot days.

The cloth weaving factories studied are in Surat, the National Capital Region, Hyderabad and Chhindwara. The steel production data is from Bhilai.

The researchers obtained payment slips for each day and digitised these to generate a worker-level dataset of daily output and attendance. They also sourced weather data from public weather stations and India Meteorological Department to map the impact.

The multi-year study indicates that climate control in the workplace removes productivity declines, but not absenteeism possibly because workers remain exposed to high temperatures at home and outside.

E Somanathan, a professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, said in the absence of climate control, worker productivity declines on hot days. “...we spot absenteeism even for workers in factories with cooling facilities. When you compound that with limited adoption of climate control technologies in manufacturing industries, you know that we are dealing with a complex problem here.”

Somanathan added it is entirely possible that the industrial sector might respond to high temperatures by increasing automation and shifting away from labour-intensive sectors in hot parts of the world. “These adaptive responses may negatively influence wage inequality,” he said in a statement.

M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said he has not read the paper, but they know the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves are going up in central and northwest India as well as the heat-wave zone along the east coast. “New modelling studies are showing that even if we managed to keep global warming under 1.5°C, heat waves will rise. Heatwaves can be fatal, so we have to be very well prepared. India Meteorological Department and National Disaster Management Authority are preparing heat action plans for states.”"

Prolonged exposure to such conditions can be fatal, even for healthy people. Lower but still high wet-bulb temperatures can affect health and productivity in other ways.

Ms. Zhang cautioned that the effect on health from her study was uncertain, since she and her colleagues looked only at how high wet-bulb temperatures would get, not how often the extremes would be reached or how long they would last. “Thorough knowledge on the health impact of intensity, frequency, and duration of high wet-bulb temperatures is needed,” she said.

The study was published in the journal Nature Geosciences.

The target of 1.5 degrees of warming was the lower of two established by the 2015 Paris Agreement among nations to fight climate change. But the world has already warmed by about 1 degree since 1900, and the ability to stay beneath the target is slowly slipping away as nations’ emissions reductions, both achieved and pledged, have fallen far short of what is needed.

A growing body of research has found that global warming so far is taking an increasing toll on human health indirectly through drought and crop failures, extreme storms and flooding, increased spread of certain insect-borne diseases and other effects.

But heat also has direct effects on the human body. Even relatively dry heat can be enough to kill people, as evidenced by the toll from heat waves in recent years. And the combination of heat and high humidity has already reached dangerous levels in parts of the world.

A study last year that looked at weather data found two sites in the tropics that have already had numerous occurrences of wet-bulb temperatures above 35 degrees, and many sites, including some along the southeastern coast of the United States, that have had TW readings from 31 to 33 degrees. But in most of the occurrences, the extreme conditions lasted only for an hour or two.

The effects of heat and humidity are worse for women, older people and those with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, said Glen Kenny, a professor of physiology at the University of Ottawa who studies how the body copes with heat stress."

Potentially deadly heat waves will likely become more commonplace in South Asian countries, including India, in the coming decades even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to a new study.

Scientists, including those from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, said such an increase in extreme heat events can create unsafe labour conditions in major crop producing parts of India, such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, as well as coastal regions and urban centres like Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad.

According to the research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, with two degrees of warming, the population's exposure to lethal temperatures rises by close to three times as compared to recent years.

""The future looks bad for South Asia, but the worst can be avoided by containing warming to as low as possible. The need for adaptation over South Asia is today, not in the future. It's not a choice anymore,"" said Moetasim Ashfaq, study co-author from Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

""Even at 1.5 degrees, South Asia will have serious consequences in terms of heat stress. That's why there is a need to radically alter the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions,"" Mr Ashfaq added.

In the study, the researchers used climate simulations and projections of future population growth to estimate the number of people who will experience dangerous levels of heat stress in South Asia at global warming levels of 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.

They estimated the wet bulb temperature residents could experience, which is similar to the heat index, as it takes into account both humidity and temperature.

The study noted that a wet bulb temperature of 32 degrees Celsius is considered to be the point when labour becomes unsafe, and 35 degrees Celsius is the limit to human survivability when the body can no longer cool itself.

Based on the analysis, the scientists said 2 degrees of warming may increase people's exposure to unsafe labour temperatures by more than two-fold, and exposure to lethal temperatures by 2.7 times, as compared to recent years.

While the planet has warmed by 1 degree Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution, it may reach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

""Only half a degree increase from today is going to cause a widespread increase in these events,"" Mr Ashfaq said.

According to the scientists, densely populated South Asian cities already lack regular access to air conditioning, and about 60 per cent of their populations perform agricultural work and cannot escape the heat by staying indoors.

This deadline leaves little time for South Asian countries to adapt, since the people here are especially vulnerable to deadly heat waves with the area already experiencing very hot, humid summers, the researchers added.

""A policy framework is very much needed to fight against heat stress and heat wave-related problems,"" said TV Lakshmi Kumar, an atmospheric scientist at SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, who was not involved in the study.

“This will reduce or prevent transpirational cooling of leaves, causing substantial increases of leaf temperature above air temperature,” Krause said.
The study estimated, for the first time, what temperatures leaves can tolerate.
What is happening at the Amazon-Cerrado boundary may be a precursor for feverish tropical forests across the world.","temperature, warning, forests, leaves, species, leaf, tree, temperatures, heat, trees, savanna, climate, tropical, warms, rainforest, turning, study, sounds, latest",heat stress,Acute climatological event (heat stress),"A recent study from Brazil shows that heat stress is disrupting a critical component of photosynthesis in tree species found in the Amazon and Cerrado belt.

Leaves heat up faster than the ambient air, and sufficiently high temperatures can cause irreversible damage to them and endanger the tree.

The area has become hotter in recent decades and faced increasingly intense heat waves, fueled not just by global warming but also local deforestation.

Tropical forests could look more and more like deciduous forests or savannas in the future, which are better adapted to deal with higher temperatures, the study found.

As the planet warms, it isn’t just humans who are feeling the heat — trees are too. Rising temperatures are disrupting a primary engine of life on Earth: photosynthesis.

A recent study from Brazil adds to fears that climate change is altering the face of the planet. Literally. Tropical forests could look more and more like deciduous forests or savannas in the future, according to the research based in Brazil’s Cerrado biome. This ecoregion abjacent to the Amazon Rainforest is where savanna, grasslands and forests mingle.

The paper, published in Environmental Research Letters in March, focused on four trees species found in both the Amazonian tropical forests and savanna land: Qualea parviflora, known as pau–terra in Portuguese; Pseudobombax longiflorum, or the Brazilian shaving-brush tree; Hymenaea stigonocarpa (jatobá do Cerrado); and Vatairea macrocarpa, also known as angelim.

“The article extends present knowledge of heat tolerance to tropical species in particularly hot regions, testing species not tested before,” said Gotthard Heinrich Krause, professor of plant physiology at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany.

Krause, who was not involved with the study, noted that the paper underlines how “increased number of extreme heatwaves, often combined with drought stress,” compound the heat stress faced by trees.

The maximum temperatures in the Cerrado region and neighboring forests can reach 45° Celsius (113° Fahrenheit). The area has warmed perceptibly in recent decades, and heat waves that regularly sweep the region are becoming hotter and dryer.

How much a leaf warms depends on how much solar radiation it absorbs and what it loses through conduction and as long-wave radiation. Leaves facing the harsh tropical sun heat up faster than the ambient air around them.

“Prolonged exposure to heat can induce damage to leaf tissue, compromising photosynthetic efficiency and, consequently, trees’ fitness,” said Igor Araújo, first author of the new paper and an ecologist at the Mato Grosso State University, Brazil.

The disproportionate warming in the Cerrado belt is driven not just by global temperature rise, but also by local deforestation and fragmentation of wooded areas. As pastureland and cropland have eaten away into forests, their cooling effect is becoming muted.

Trees cool themselves and areas around them by transpiring water through the stomata dotting their leaf surfaces. This process, along with evaporation, is also why forested areas induce rainfall. “One single adult tree in the Amazon can transpire up to 1000 L [264 gallons] of water per day, functioning as a natural air conditioner of the environment. This process is called biotic pump, which is reduced by deforestation,” Araújo said.

When faced with scorching heat and dry spells, the pores on leaves clamp shut to conserve water. “This will reduce or prevent transpirational cooling of leaves, causing substantial increases of leaf temperature above air temperature,” Krause said.

The study estimated, for the first time, what temperatures leaves can tolerate. To do this, the authors calculated the temperature at which a critical component of the photosystem breaks down and the temperatures that leaves are experiencing. The difference between the two levels is called the thermal safety margin (Tsm).

Krause said he expected that the temperature at which scientists observe permanent damage to leaf tissue to be higher than what the researchers estimate. This would mean a wider safety net, but it still would not be enough to protect most species considered in the research, given the current pace of warming.

Such a hostile environment is dangerous for leaves and trees. The tree is not shedding leaves as part of a seasonal cycle but rather because they are not performing their function of harnessing energy.

The authors found that in some species, the maximum leaf temperatures are already exceeding this threshold. But if average temperatures rise by even 2.5°C (4.5°F), this will be true for most tree species, they estimate. With a 5°C (9°F) rise, all tree species studied will suffer from leaf burn.

It’s not just tree health that declines; other scientists have shown that heat stress also affects carbon dioxide uptake by trees. According to Krause, there is a reduction in the CO2 absorbed by plants even at temperatures lower than those that short-circuit photosynthesis. “Such reduction will contribute to the reduction in carbon sink of the tropical forest,” he said.

At the moment, savanna species adapted to higher temperatures are doing better than the rainforest species. “Our results thus indicate expected shifts in deciduousness in the future and thus a trend towards savanna vegetation replacing forests in the regions in Southern Amazonia characterized by large patches of deforestation,” the authors write.

What is happening at the Amazon-Cerrado boundary may be a precursor for feverish tropical forests across the world. Unlike humans, these forests won’t have air conditioners or sunscreens to protect them.

A consortium led by the University of Warwick have successfully identified two proteins that protect crops from stress, which is key in safeguarding food production.

Plant fertility is dramatically affected by spikes in temperature, directly resulting in yield reduction and economic loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin plant fertility under environmental constraints is critical to safeguarding food production.

In the paper, 'A transposon surveillance mechanism that safeguards plant male fertility during stress', published in the journal Nature Plants, led by researchers from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Warwick have studied the molecular mechanisms that maize plants utilise to safeguard fertility under high temperatures, and identified two Argonaute-like (AGO) proteins that protect the male sex cells.

By subjecting maize plants with non-functional AGO proteins to different growth conditions, researchers discovered that a 5?C increase in ambient temperature dramatically decreased male fertility.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, the team found that higher temperatures activated small pieces of ribonucleic acid (or small RNAs) in wild-type plants, which bind to these AGO proteins to control the activity of stress-activated jumping genes -- pieces of DNA that can copy themselves into different parts of the genome. Therefore, these AGO proteins control the activity of jumping-genes, thereby protect plant fertility.

Professor Jose Gutierrez-Marcos, from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Warwick explains:

""We have essentially found that when plants are stressed by high temperatures they activate an RNA-guided surveillance mechanism in the form of small RNAs and Argonaute proteins, in reproductive cells which are critical to sustain male fertility and ultimately plant survival.

""Understanding the molecular mechanism implicated in safeguarding plant fertility is critical to safeguard future crop production under unpredictable and stressful climatic conditions.""

Dr Charo del Genio, from the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics at Coventry University adds:

""Modelling the structure of the Argonaute proteins and simulating them at the level of the single atoms revealed how they change their electric charge when subject to thermal stress, initiating the process that brings the jumping genes back under control."""

Protective apparel that keeps workers cool should be a safety priority.

Human beings have been working in the heat since the beginning of time, but even in our modern age, physical exertion in hot temperatures too often leads to serious heat illness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that 11 workers are seriously injured or die from heat stress every day in the United States.

This statistic would be bad enough for any type of accident, but heat illness is 100 percent preventable. Whether it’s due to lack of information, complacent attitudes, limited cooling solutions or some combination of the three, this problem remains at the top of safety managers’ concerns.

The good news is that manufacturers have been hard at work inventing new solutions to keep workers cooler and safer in surprisingly convenient ways.

Tried and True Heat Stress Busters

Before you begin exploring the latest and greatest in body cooling solutions, make sure you have the basics in place. The first, and possibly most important way to start, is with training. Team leaders who understand and share the basics of heat stress avoidance are leaders who will have fewer employees in distress. But many employees, and sometimes even managers, don’t fully understand how the body responds to overheating, and often think they can simply wing it with a little water and a wide brimmed hat.

Training that emphasizes hydration the night before, on the job and after the job, as well as factors like medication and alcohol that can change the way the body responds to the heat is crucial. Educate your whole team about the dangers of microclimates—areas of the job that are hotter than others due to hot machinery, lack of shade or other factors. Keep cold water and electrolyte-replacing beverages on hand. At the same time, emphasize that in hot working conditions, hydration alone will not prevent heat illness without additional body cooling measures. Change any hot day’s schedule to include more rest breaks, and above all, make sure everyone from the job foreman to the newest worker knows the signs of heat stress and how to respond to the four levels of heat illness, up to and including deadly heat stroke.

(Saeed et. al/ Geophysical Research Letters/AGU)

Global warming has the potential to create a major domino effect across the planet, which could range from minor changes in certain ecosystems to the complete collapse of a few others. Either way, the fact that Earth’s increasing ‘fever’ will catastrophically touch each and every part of the planet cannot be ignored.

Now, a new study has projected a grim prospect, particularly for the South Asian region. The details sketched out by the research state that with a global 2°C rise, this region’s exposure to deadly heatwaves would become more frequent—in fact, it is expected to triple compared to the current exposure! Moreover, even if the mercury levels in the region are limited to 1.5°C, the impact of rising heat stress will only narrow down to half.

“The future looks bad for South Asia, but the worst can be avoided by containing warming to as low as possible,” said Moetasim Ashfaq, a computational climate scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

“The need for adaptation over South Asia is today, not in the future. It's not a choice anymore. Only half a degree increase from today is going to cause a widespread increase in these events.”

Heatwaves in India

The study shows that people dwelling in major crop-producing Indian states of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, along with residents of Sindh in Pakistan are most likely to face the brunt of the increasing number of heatwaves. Moreover, urban centres located on coastal belts, such as Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad may also fall into the grip of heat stress.

Earlier studies had projected that heatwaves would become more lethal by the end of the century. However, the authors of this study assert that this has already started to occur in South Asia, as the year 2015 already witnessed some of the most severe heat episodes on record. It is regarded as the fifth deadliest heatwave in history, which killed nearly 3,500 people, out of which 2,300 deaths were reported from India alone.

A recent report from The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change highlighted that India recorded over 31,000 heat-related mortality incidents in 2018 alone among the 65-plus aged population. This ranks India second, after China, which witnessed about 62,000 deaths in the same year.

Impact of rising temperature

Advertisement At present, the South Asian region, which also includes India, experiences periodic heatwaves, typically in the hot summer months between March to June. As per the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a heatwave occurs when the daily maximum temperature crosses the average mark by 5°C or more consecutively for five days or more.

The team calculated how the heat stress will impact the demographics of the region if the temperatures spike by 1.5°C and 2°C. The results indicated that residents who live in the wet-bulb temperature of 32°C will endure conditions that make labour activities unsafe, while those residing in areas above 35°C will witness a severe impact on their survivability.

Wet-bulb temperature refers to the lowest temperature that can be reached under a certain ambient condition after evaporating all the water. At the wet-bulb temperature levels mentioned above, the human body loses the capability of regulating its temperature in order to keep it cool amid the surrounding heat.

Therefore, with a 2°C rise, the population at risk of unsafe labour temperatures will increase more than two-fold. But if the rise is restricted to 1.5°C, it will reduce the exposure to extensive heat stress by half—nevertheless, people will endure scorching temperatures.

This makes South Asian people—nearly one-quarter of the total world's population—more vulnerable to deadly heatwaves. And if the temperatures continue to spike it can have a widespread impact on the livelihood of people in the region.

The study was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters earlier this month and can be accessed here.
