The University and College Union will ballot its members to strike against the resumption of in-person teaching, should any university attempt to organise the return of its staff to campuses over the next six months while staff feel it is unsafe.

The move comes as the National Union of Students demands that universities stop charging students fees and offer them rent rebates while they are unable to use their accommodation, with thousands planning rent strikes.

Jo Grady, general secretary of the UCU, told the Observer that university teaching must remain online for the remainder of the academic year for safety reasons. “We’ve realised now that showing the government scientific data does not lead them to make good decisions. So we’re taking the matter into our own hands, and where members in universities are concerned that employers will bring people back too early and it will lead to a public health disaster, like it did in September, they will ballot. They will win those ballots. And they will refuse to do in-person activities as part of that.”

Decisions to strike will be taken by individual UCU branches, as some universities – including Cambridge, the London School of Economics and the University of York – have already moved all classroom-based teaching online for the rest of the semester or academic year. Current government guidance states only that non-essential teaching should be done remotely until “at least mid-February”.

“Some universities are acting far more sensibly than others,” Grady said. “But we’ve made it very clear to all our branches that if you are worried about what your employer is going to do, we will recommend branches ballot [for strike action] so they are able to continue delivering remotely what would be unsafe to do in person. Because legally, that is the only option we have. Government inaction and employer intransigence has left us with no other choice.”

University staff need certainty that teaching will continue to take place online, Grady said. “Being told to switch between remote and face-to-face teaching, or indeed deliver both, has led to incredible levels of stress and burnout in a sector that was already understaffed.”

NUS president Larissa Kennedy said students and staff have all been bearing the brunt of 11th-hour decisions from the government and that students cannot afford to keep paying for accommodation they are not allowed to live in.

“Students need rent rebates and rent reductions in order to get through the next few months.

“Unlike when our decision-makers went to university, nowadays, lots of students have to work just to be able to survive and afford to access education.”

Many students normally work part-time in the leisure, hospitality and retail sectors, and are in thousands of pounds of debt in rent arrears already. “It’s impacting student mental health. When you are on the brink financially and it doesn’t feel like there’s a way out or you have rights or options, it’s incredibly daunting and harrowing,” Kennedy said.

An online survey of more than 300 students’ feelings about the pandemic by Sheffield University undergraduate Orla Katz Webb-Lamb showed just how damaging it has been to their mental health.

Respondents described their experience as “cripplingly lonely”, “isolating and overwhelming” and “a waste of money”. Another said they “weren’t sure they wanted to make it to 2021”. One respondent complained: “There is so much uncertainty alongside increased isolation,” while others spoke of how stressful and depressing home-learning is: “I would like to go to the library with my classmates.”

“The general response to student complaints is along the lines of ‘tough shit’ and it’s just not good enough,” Katz Webb-Lamb said. “We’ve been abandoned by the government – students weren’t even mentioned in Boris Johnson’s 4 January briefing. We need action now – action on fees, action on academic support and action on mental health.”"

Dr Tao Lina, a vaccine expert from Shanghai, pointed out to his 4.8million social media followers on Tuesday that the jab developed by Beijing's state-run drugmaker Sinopharm had 73 side effects.

After his remarks were widely reported outside mainland China, the medical worker today denied having criticised the vaccine and denounced foreign media outlets for 'twisting' and 'exploiting' his words.

Dr Tao claimed his controversial post, which has disappeared, had been written in an 'extremely sarcastic' tone.

He insisted that the Chinese treatment was 'very safe' and apologised to his fellow countrymen for his 'imprudent' choice of words.

On New Year's Eve, Beijing's health authorities granted 'conditional' approval to Sinopharm's vaccine, which is reported to have an efficacy rate of 79.34 per cent.

The country is aiming to inoculate millions of people, mostly front-line workers and working-age population, before the upcoming Lunar New Year travel rush in mid-February.

On New Year's Eve, Chinese health authorities granted 'conditional' approval to Sinopharm's two-dose vaccine (pictured), which is reported to have an efficacy rate of 79.34 per cent

The vaccine outrage came to light earlier this week when Dr Tao published a blog titled 'Sinopharm's inactivated COVID-19 vaccine feared to be the most unsafe vaccine in the world'.

The article was uploaded to Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, but is no longer visible on Dr Tao's account for unknown reasons as of writing.

A screenshot of the post shows the medic's controversial comments about the anti-coronavirus product.

He wrote that the jab had 'as many as 73 side effects, catapulting it to be the most unsafe vaccine in the world'.

Some of the listed side effects were pain around the injection area, headache, high blood pressure, the loss of vision and taste, and urinary incontinence.

The expert stated that none of the vaccines in the world 'has more side effects' than the two-dose COVID-19 regimen from Sinopharm and described the drug's potential adverse impact as 'unprecedented'.

Dr Tao's assertions were quickly noticed and picked up by various news websites based outside mainland China, including Apple Daily, Voice of America and Taiwan News.

China.com, a website supervised by the Chinese Communist Party, also reported on Dr Tao's post, but the article appeared to be inaccessible on Thursday.

In a Weibo post on Thursday, Dr Tao refuted allegations that he had blasted Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine.

He argued that his previous blog was an 'extremely sarcastic' column aimed at pointing out the errors in the manual of the Sinopharm vaccine.

He claimed he had suspected that many of the side effects had been listed by mistake. Therefore, he decided to write a blog to mock the flawed handbook to call for the drugmaker's attention.

To ensure his followers the safety of the medicine, Dr Tao claimed he had received the first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine and would get his second dose on Saturday.

'Hereby, I extend my apologies to numerous web users and citizens across the nation, and express my despisal against the evil actions of overseas media,' Dr Tao wrote.

The news came as China National Biotec Group (CNBG) said on Thursday that it had administered more than 4million COVID-19 vaccine doses as of January 4 via China's emergency use programme.

Two vaccines respectively from two institutes owned by CNBG, a unit of Sinopharm, are included in China's emergency vaccination scheme, which was officially launched in July targeting specific groups of people facing a high infection risk.

'No serious adverse reaction was reported in large-scale emergency use of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccines,' CNBG said on Chinese social media WeChat.

While the United Kingdom and other Western countries prioritise the immunisation of senior citizens and essential workers to reach herd immunity, China is racing to vaccinate those aged between 18 and 59 who work for the government and public services or have plans to travel overseas.

The country is putting nine 'key groups' of people ahead of the queue in its inoculation campaign.

They include customs inspection and quarantine officers for imported frozen food, international and domestic transport workers, and employees of government organisations, police, fire brigades and local communities.

Staff in the logistics and public utility sectors are also included. So are those who plan to study or work overseas."

On Dec. 30 of last year, BBIBP-CorV, an inactivated vaccine produced by China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a subsidiary of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (Sinopharm), was officially approved by China's National Medical Products Administration for general use in the communist country. This was the first Wuhan coronavirus vaccine approved by the Chinese government, and the state-run firm claimed that it has an efficacy rate of 79.34 percent based on late-stage trials.

However, Shanghai-based vaccine expert, Tao Lina (陶黎納), recently uploaded a digital version of the vaccine's instruction manual onto his Weibo page, reported Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper. He stated that after he read the manual, ""I took in a long cold breath, and counted the conditions listed in the 'adverse reactions' column."" He found that there were 73 local/systemic adverse reactions associated with the vaccine.

The vaccine expert found that in addition to pain in the injection site and headache, there were severe side effects listed that were ""more likely to occur,"" such as high blood pressure, loss of vision, loss of taste, delayed menstruation, and urinary incontinence.

He wrote that the 73 adverse reactions to the vaccine listed on the manual make it what he describes as the ""most unsafe vaccine in the world in one fell swoop.""

Tao wrote that no inactivated vaccine has more types of adverse reactions than this product. He also asserted that this number of adverse reactions is ""absolutely unprecedented.""

He stated that other doctors jokingly described the manual as ""one long disclaimer."" However, he alleged that as long as the side effects are listed in the manual, recipients are not entitled to compensation if they occur.

He warned that the company will be immune to lawsuits from people seeking compensation for suffering the vaccine's side effects and that the provincial governments will be expected to provide recompense instead. Tao suggested that the provincial governments will then face most of the blame if there are major problems with the vaccine.

His Weibo account was quickly deleted by authorities. His page now states ""this content cannot be viewed due to violation of regulations.""

Tao, 43, has been working in the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SCDC) since August of 2000 and is responsible for vaccine management. In late December of last year, Beijing Business Today interviewed him on issues related to the COVID-19 vaccine."
4,2021-01-06 18:38:00+08:00,,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/definitions-key-as-biden-urges-benefits-for-refusing-unsafe-work,,"states, federal, labor, guidance, refuse, state, workers, policy, unemployment, benefits",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Workers who refuse a job they consider unsafe might have an easier time getting unemployment benefits under a Biden administration proposal, but big questions remain around the policy’s specifics and how states will apply it.

President Joe Biden instructed the U.S. Labor Department to consider issuing guidance to clarify that “workers have a federally guaranteed right to refuse employment that will jeopardize their health” while still qualifying for unemployment benefits. The White House announced the policy Jan. 22 as one of many federal agency actions springing from an executive order aimed at economic relief during the Covid-19 pandemic.

A lot depends on the level of detail in any guidance memo the Labor Department might publish. The federal agency might end up largely reiterating the flexibility that it spelled out for states in guidance issued last March or it could become more prescriptive in pushing states to err on the side of granting benefits for people with workplace safety concerns specific to the virus.

The policy goal seems to be creating a national standard of what’s considered a safe or unsafe workplace, for purposes of unemployment benefits eligibility, said Isabel Soto, director of labor market policy at the center-right think tank American Action Forum.

“The problem is it’s trying to do that on top of a whole patchwork of standards at the state level,” as some states set their own workplace safety standards and others rely on federal rules, she said. “It might just be muddying the waters.”

“There’s a chance that this is just signaling. There’s a chance that this could lead to serious change. If it’s the latter, there’s no way of knowing how significant it will be” until more details are released, Soto said.

This latest unemployment policy action from Biden joins an earlier proposal that he announced as part of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package. In that plan, he proposed increasing the federal unemployment bonus payments to $400 per week and extending them through September. Unemployment claimants are currently getting a $300 per week federal payment, which comes on top of traditional state benefits. That supplement is due to expire in March.

Employers and workers continue to navigate business closures and restrictions that vary widely by city and state in response to the pandemic. The latest federal unemployment data showed new claims for jobless benefits remained higher than typical at about 900,000 for the week ending Jan. 16, although they declined slightly from the previous week.

Biden’s proposal aims to “help ensure that unemployed Americans no longer have to choose between paying their bills and keeping themselves and their families safe from COVID-19,” according to a White House fact sheet.

The Labor Department “is developing an Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) to provide guidance to state workforce systems in response to the order and will provide additional information when it is complete,” a department spokesperson said, without responding to a question about the timeline for releasing the letter.

Defining Unsafe Workplace

“What I’m looking for the Labor Department to do is to cover some of the common scenarios,” said Andrew Stettner, an unemployment policy analyst at left-leaning think tank The Century Foundation.

In particular, workers would benefit from guidance that allows them to refuse work if the employer isn’t following safety protocols prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or by a new workplace safety standard expected to be published by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, he said.

“You’re going to have to have a good reason for feeling unsafe,” not just a general fear of the virus, he said. Examples of potentially acceptable reasons include being immunocompromised or being over 65 and not yet vaccinated, he added.

The concept of a right to refuse work that’s not “suitable” isn’t new in unemployment policy, but it gets complicated by the pandemic, said Doug Holmes, a former state unemployment director in Ohio who now lobbies on behalf of employers.

“The question becomes how do you really evaluate whether a job is safe or not,” he said. “I would say in most cases a generalized fear of Covid would not be connected to the work. But if there’s something specific to the work that’s being offered that puts someone at unusual risk or unreasonable risk, states would consider that as a reason to refuse work.”

Potential Business Burden

A push toward granting jobless benefits more leniently for people who quit or refuse to return to their jobs sounds good in theory in terms of public health, but could add another burden to already-strained employers, especially small businesses, Soto said. It also comes on top of other Biden proposals that would hit businesses hard if enacted, such as a $15 minimum wage nationwide, she added.

“Suddenly you’re facing the prospect of losing who knows how many employees depending on the shape this change in policy takes,” she said. “You could potentially offer some kind of pay bump, but it’s going to be difficult to compete with an unemployment system that has this federal bump on top of it.”

The frequency of workers attempting to claim benefits because of an unsafe or unsuitable workplace is not very high, though, Holmes said.

“The number of claims that turn on this issue is really small, compared to the huge number of people being paid,” he said.

A more lenient policy—especially if its guidelines aren’t clearly defined—also opens the door to more unemployment fraud, Soto said.

Varying State Approaches

The net result of Biden’s proposal for workers and employers also could vary substantially from state to state—with some taking a more generous approach toward approving benefits and others being stricter about what counts as a good reason to refuse work.

Minnesota, for example, issued guidelines for safe business reopening protocols last year and told workers they could refuse to return to work and claim unemployment benefits if their employer didn’t follow the guidelines, Stettner said.

“There have been some states that have put out guidance, but it’s been very patchwork,” he said.

Texas also issued guidance last year that provided workers a list of criteria under which they might qualify for benefits if they chose to quit or not return to their jobs—while noting such claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The criteria include people age 65 or older or those having underlying medical problems, people with at-risk household members, and parents whose child-care centers are closed. The state’s special criteria for traditional unemployment benefits are similar to special eligibility rules for the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which covers independent contractors, self-employed people, and others who don’t qualify for traditional unemployment.

James Bernsen, a spokesman for the Texas Workforce Commission, couldn’t say how Biden’s latest proposal might change the state’s unemployment eligibility rules or claims review process.

“We are, of course, still waiting for DOL guidelines,” Bernsen said."

In more traditional times, suitable work is thought of as a job that matches your skill set and pays a similar rate as your old one.
For example, you can't just walk into your work facility, see that no one's wearing a mask, walk off the job and later file for unemployment.
These individuals may qualify for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance federal program, which currently phases out by mid-April.

Generally, you can't refuse what's considered ""suitable work,"" whether it's a new job offer or a call to return to a reopened workplace, and still receive unemployment insurance. In more traditional times, suitable work is thought of as a job that matches your skill set and pays a similar rate as your old one.

Don't miss: The best credit cards for building credit

But during the pandemic, the health and safety risks imposed by the coronavirus have blurred what ""suitable work"" looks like, especially for those who have underlying health conditions or are at higher risk of severe illness from the virus.

Under the Trump administration, states, local governments and employers were often left to determine what constituted as a safe work environment free of risks to workers' health and safety during the Covid pandemic. Recent moves from the Biden White House aim to formalize a national standard.

As with existing protocol, new federal guidance will still require workers to demonstrate how their work environment places their health in jeopardy, that they've done something to raise the issue with their employer to enforce an improved standard, and that their employer has chosen to not act on recommended health and safety guidance, such as that from the CDC, local or state regulations — and soon, federal guidance on workplace health and safety.

For example, you can't just walk into your work facility, see that no one's wearing a mask, walk off the job and later file for unemployment. However, if you approach your boss about enforcing universal mask-wearing to minimize the spread of the virus, and they decline to do so, you may have just cause for refusing unsafe work that places your health in jeopardy and qualifying for unemployment benefits while you look for a new job.

Worker advocates anticipate that firming up state-by-state rules into a federal standard will make it easier for people to realize their right to refuse work if it jeopardizes their health, and know they can still receive jobless aid while they find new work.

The CARES Act also clarified additional reasons someone may need to refuse work and remain eligible for unemployment insurance, such as if they must stay home to provide child care during school and care facility closures, or if they're advised by a health professional to self-isolate due to an underlying medical condition. These individuals may qualify for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance federal program, which currently phases out by mid-April.

Almost 100 million people of different cities of China have been reportedly supplied with potable water containing high levels of toxic chemicals.

South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that the cities of Wuxi, Hangzhou and Suzhou and Foshan have been impacted by the unsafe level of dangerous chemicals in water.

A team of Tsinghua University found high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyls (PFAS), which are used in fabrics and pesticides.

The concentration of PFAS in the water of these cities has been found by the team to be more than 20%, much beyond safe levels.

The study team used the US state of Vermont’s regulations as the benchmark because China does not have any national safety standards, reported the publication.



Intensive industrial activity and high population density have been cited as main reasons for the contamination of water.

Mean concentration of PFAS in eastern China was found to be 2.6 times more than the northern China.

The study’s co-author Ronald Weber told the publication that some chemicals, especially PFOA and PFOS, were far more dangerous than others as they have been linked to several health risks.

Weber added that China has to review the scale of the problem and then chalk out plans to address it."

And, of course, once a weak or compromised password has been spotted it can be replaced to a stronger, safer password on the spot.

These password security audits come as part of the browser’s “Safety Check” feature introduced last year.

Google says that Chrome’s Safety Check feature is used 14 million time every week, and since its introduction there has been a 38% reduction in the number of compromised login passwords stored in the browser.

With the latest enhancements, according to Google, users will be able to “update multiple usernames easily, in one convenient place.” Initially the improved feature set will be available on the desktop and iOS versions of Chrome, but will be coming to the Android version “soon.”

Personally, I’m more of a fan of using a third-party password manager than the one built into my web browser – but any kind of password manager is better than none at all, and anything that helps computer users raise their game when it comes to the passwords they use online has to be good news.

Around 45,000 people have been fined for breaking Covid-19 rules, with many facing prosecution for failing to pay up. In London alone, hundreds have been dragged through the courts, often behind closed doors. Yet not a single British employer has been prosecuted for violating rules that exist to save lives, and protect the NHS from the tsunami overwhelming it.

Operation “blame the public” is in full swing. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells the nation that people are “taking the mickey” by using a rule allowing us to exercise with another person to socialise. Home secretary Priti Patel damns rule-breakers for risking the health of the nation, while newspapers point fingers at people stopping for a chat outside coffee shops: “CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES,” bellows the Metro’s front page. In an echo of the Tories’ campaign to demonise benefit claimants in the David Cameron era, extreme individual transgressions are hunted down, extrapolated and presented as a mere tip of the iceberg: like the mum fined for driving 100 miles to get a McDonald’s burger.

The evidence exposes such stories for the unrepresentative outliers they are. As the British Medical Journal found last week: “To the surprise of many, adherence to stringent behavioural regulations has remained extremely high (over 90%), even though many people are suffering considerably, both financially and psychologically.”

Given that we know the main route for Covid-19 transmission is through the presence of more than one human being in a confined indoor space, the focus should not be on frivolous chats between friends on open-air walks, but on many of the workplaces that remain open for business across the country. More than seven in 10 workers don’t feel completely safe at work: unsurprising, given that research by the Trades Union Congress finds that many workplaces are still not Covid-secure.

If you walk around town centres, rather than looking out for illicit hugs, peer through the window of your local estate agent. You will find non-essential retail closed for business, but the warehouses of online stores operate as normal, and they have not been compelled by the government to update risk assessments to ensure properly working ventilation systems. At the insistence of the chancellor Rishi Sunak – who has resisted lockdown measures, and prioritised economic interests over public health – 2.7 million manufacturing workers remain at work, and construction sites remain open for business. While Covid-19 poses little threat to small children with no underlying health conditions, nurseries risk the health of those who work there and the wider community.

The simple truth is that it is easier to encourage the public to peer through their blinds looking for local ne’er-do-wells than to tackle one of the lowest levels of statutory sick pay in the industrialised world. Unions are inundated with messages from workers saying they have no option but to work – even if they fall ill – because they simply cannot afford not to do so. A shredded social security net collides with the fetishisation of work – in August, ministers let it be known that employees failing to return to the workplace risked losing their jobs – with predictable consequences: the spreading of a deadly virus, and a horrifying second wave.

All these factors are far more likely to drive up the R number than isolated individual violations of the (belatedly implemented, constantly changing) lockdown rules. Aided by a largely supine media, the government’s attempt to shift the blame from the bosses to the public appears to be working: 58% hold the public responsible for the surge in coronavirus cases, with just 28% blaming the government.

How is this possible? After all, the vast majority of Britons could say – honestly – that they have abided by necessarily authoritarian Covid rules, for many months, at great personal sacrifice. The “public” that is being held responsible is a demonised, phantom “other”. On a basic psychological level you can see how this works: every time you see someone who appears to be flouting the rules, you feel a rush of irritation – at someone raising their middle finger at society, while you suffer the consequences of sticking to your legal and moral obligations. Those moments of frustration stick in our memories, in a way that seeing the vast majority of strangers socially distancing and wearing masks does not. They are also less abstract than thinking about non-essential workplaces being kept open, or bosses failing to ensure that their employees are safe. And 40 years of Thatcherite dogma – that the evils in society are caused by individual failings, such as laziness – make it easy to suggest spiralling infections are due to failures of personal responsibility, rather than systemic problems accelerated by government failures.

At huge economic, social and psychological cost, and despite numerous government failures, the public has overwhelmingly accepted the mass curtailment of their freedoms. Britain is not in a near-uniquely disastrous situation because of the flawed character of its citizens. For dubious economic reasons – the more you fail to tackle a public health crisis, the more harm you inflict on the economy – the government has allowed often unsafe workplaces to remain open. That is one of many reasons Britain has sunk into a coronavirus mire. And if the government succeeds in convincing its population to blame each other, we will surely sink further.

The four chief nursing officers and the Nursing and Midwifery Council has today issued an open letter outlining how they will continue to support staff during the pandemic.

“Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise and there are already sustained additional pressures on parts of the NHS and other elements of health and care provision” Letter

It comes as the UK records another 68,053 new positive cases and a further 1,325 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 - the highest number of UK deaths reported on a single day since the outbreak began.

Meanwhile, the mayor of London has declared a “major incident” in the capital because the threat of Covid-19 on the city “is at crisis point”.

The letter, signed by CNO for England Ruth May, CNO for Scotland Professor Fiona McQueen, CNO for Northern Ireland Professor Charlotte McArdle, CNO for Wales Professor Jean White and NMC chief executive and registrar Andrea Sutcliffe, recognised the worsening situation and the impact on staff.

“Unfortunately, as we all know, Covid-19 cases are continuing to rise and there are already sustained additional pressures on parts of the NHS and other elements of health and care provision,” it said.

“Staffing shortages due to sickness or caring responsibilities will exacerbate the pressures and despite actions to date to address this, the impact on staff both personally and professionally will be profound and potentially prolonged throughout the coming months.”

It goes on to address the ongoing need for nurses to “respond flexibly, including potentially working outside our normal roles or places of work”, as many have done since the pandemic began.

As health and care services “continue to be under extreme pressure”, the nursing leaders urged staff to “speak up if you see things that are unsafe”.

“This will help to make sure that appropriate steps can be taken and help to ensure that people can be cared for as well as possible,” the letter added.

“While you’re caring for others it can be challenging to find the time to take care of yourself, but it is so important that you do” Letter

They also recognised that staff “may feel anxious about how context is taken into account when concerns are raised about their decisions and actions in very challenging circumstances”.

The letter reassured the profession that the nursing regulator would “always consider the specific facts of the case, taking into account the factors relevant to the environment in which a professional is working”.

Pointing to the NMC Code, the nurse leaders reiterated that professionals “must continue to adhere to the core principles of nursing and midwifery practice”.

“As registered professionals we should always practise in line with the NMC code and use our professional judgement, taking account of the realities of an abnormal emergency situation,” it said.

In addition, the impact of the pandemic on the health and wellbeing of staff continued to be a cause for concern for the nurse leaders.

“While you’re caring for others it can be challenging to find the time to take care of yourself, but it is so important that you do,” the letter said.

The correspondence also highlighted the extension of the Covid-19 temporary register to new groups of nurses that trained overseas, as reported by Nursing Times.

In terms of Covid-19 vaccinations, the leaders reassured staff that they were “among the high priority groups”, noting that “health and care services across the UK are working hard to get this to you as soon as possible”.

Giving more workers options wouldn’t just offer people a financial alternative to jobs with proven safety risks.
It also would help lower Covid-19 transmission rates during a time when combating the virus is key to an economic recovery.
But Biden already has signed an executive order directing the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration to beef up its Covid-19 workplace safety guidelines and step up enforcement, which had been non-existent under the Trump administration.
Between both changes, the message to US employers is clear: Make sure your employees feel safe.","pay, labor, safe, jobs, safety, unsafe, workplace, workers, quit, file, covid19, face, unemployment, administration",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the news has been filled with stories of US companies that have failed to keep employees safe, whether by not providing PPE or by making it impossible for workers to spread out and maintain a safe distance.

For many delivery workers, restaurant servers, caregivers, and food processing workers, quitting out of safety concerns has been out of the question—because whether they would be eligible for unemployment benefits is unclear under current laws. At the very least, proving that fears of catching the virus at work are justified would fall on the claimant.

Now, US president Joe Biden wants to do away with the confusion.

In a fact sheet released by the White House on Jan. 22, the new administration announced it would help “ensure that unemployed Americans no longer have to choose between paying their bills and keeping themselves and their families safe from Covid-19 by asking the US Department of Labor to consider clarifying that workers who refuse unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance.”

If such a clarification were to materialize, it would be a welcome game-changer for US workers, though it also would likely invite pushback from conservative lawmakers. As the New York Times reported, some Republicans worried last year that low-paid workers would quit their jobs and give up on finding work because of enhanced unemployment benefits, which paid an extra $600 per week. Research suggests their concerns were overblown. For example, a paper (pdf) from the Groundwork Collective and the National Employment Law Project found that a majority of Americans currently collecting unemployment insurance worked in industries where the average total pay is higher than average weekly unemployment benefits.

It’s reasonable to believe that if the rules changed, most people would still choose to keep their jobs over collecting unemployment insurance—provided they were comfortable with the amount of risk they face in the workplace.

Implementing a policy like the one the Biden administration requested would result in workers, particularly low-wage workers, having more choice over their safety, says Erica Groshen, an economist at Cornell University and a former commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The alternative is workers continue to toil under unsafe conditions with “no financial alternative” since they need to continue to pay rent and put food on the table, she says.

Giving more workers options wouldn’t just offer people a financial alternative to jobs with proven safety risks. It also would help lower Covid-19 transmission rates during a time when combating the virus is key to an economic recovery. According to Goshen, the policy also could nudge employers to pay more and create safer working conditions.

The administration’s language on the topic is hardly forceful, so its request of the Labor Department may not signal that real change is around the corner. But Biden already has signed an executive order directing the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration to beef up its Covid-19 workplace safety guidelines and step up enforcement, which had been non-existent under the Trump administration. Soon, companies that fail to comply with safety rules could face stiff fines.

Between both changes, the message to US employers is clear: Make sure your employees feel safe. It’s the right thing to do, and you will face consequences if you don’t."

The Wisconsin pharmacist accused of intentionally sabotaging more than 500 doses of the coronavirus vaccine at Christmastime told police he did it because he believed the drug is somehow hazardous.

""He'd formed this belief they were unsafe,"" Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol said of Steven Brandenburg on Monday during a virtual hearing, The Associated Press reported.

Gerol did not offer more information on why Brandenburg was convinced the inoculations could be harmful, but he did paint a picture of a troubled man in the midst of personal turmoil. He explained that the 46-year-old is in the process of divorcing his wife, and he said a fellow Advocate Aurora Health employee reported that Brandenburg had taken a gun to work twice.

Brandenburg, who worked as a pharmacist with the Advocate Aurora Health hospital system, has admitted he deliberately removed 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine from refrigeration and left them out overnight on Dec. 24 and again on Dec. 25. After leaving them out at room temperature overnight on Christmas Eve, Brandenburg returned the vials to their proper storage. But after he pulled them out the second night, they were discovered by a pharmacy technician.

Wisconsin Public Radio reports Gerol couldn't submit proof to the court that the drugs had been damaged and that therefore a crime had been committed.

""And apparently the only way they can discover that or tell us that is if they test them. It's unknown how much time that will take,"" Gerol said, according to the outlet.

The Moderna vials must be stored between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. They can remain effective for up to 12 hours if left at room temperature. Beyond that, the drugmaker says, the vaccine is no longer effective.

Regardless, there is a crime known as attempted criminal damage to property, Gerol said, and that ""would be a misdemeanor and that would seem to apply at some point in time in the future.""

Brandenburg has since been fired after the incident.

As a result of Brandenburg's tampering, health care workers were forced to discard about 570 doses of the potentially lifesaving vaccine. Hospital officials said 57 individuals did receive injections of what may have been useless doses. Those patients have been notified and are not at any risk of adverse health effects, hospital officials said on Friday. The pharmacist last week told investigators he knew ""that people who received the vaccinations would think they had been vaccinated against the virus when in fact they were not,"" officials said.

Brandenburg was arrested on Thursday by the Grafton Police Department on recommended charges of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, adulterating a prescription drug and criminal damage to property. The FBI and U.S. Food and Drug Administration are also investigating.

The AP reported: ""Judge Paul Malloy set a $10,000 signature bond for Brandenburg and ordered him to surrender all his firearms to sheriff's deputies, not to work in the health care field and to have no contact with Aurora employees.""

Brandenburg was released on Monday afternoon."

Public discussions about abortion are always difficult. They are inevitably affected by stigma, religious beliefs, and profound ethical convictions.

The current debate in Argentina about legalizing abortion is no exception. But a serious and objective analysis of the legal norms at stake and available evidence shows that criminalization of abortion undermines fundamental human rights. Argentine senators should pass the bill sent by President Alberto Fernández to legalize abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy in all circumstances, and later, if the pregnancy resulted from rape or threatened the person’s life or health, exceptions currently allowed by the Criminal Code.

International human rights bodies have repeatedly asked Argentina to reform its abortion laws. These expert bodies are tasked with interpreting international human rights law – it is their authoritative interpretation that should guide our analysis, and not individual personal views.

There are, undoubtedly, different ethical and biological views about when human life begins. However, in legal terms, legalizing abortion is compatible with the right to life. International bodies, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, have repeatedly noted that under international human rights law there is no absolute right to life before birth.

Opponents of the bill to legalize abortion often invoke the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, claiming that the bill would run counter to children’s right to life. Yet, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, charged with interpreting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, has called on countries, including Argentina, to “decriminalize abortion” to ensure the right to health of adolescent girls. Similarly, the president of the committee publicly supported the bill to legalize abortion in Argentina during his presentation in the hearings in Congress.

To be clear, there is no international legal instrument explicitly referencing the right to have an abortion. However, the bodies and experts in charge of interpreting the scope of Argentina’s legal obligations under the treaties the country has ratified have repeatedly found that decriminalizing and ensuring access to abortion is necessary to protect fundamental human rights, including women’s rights to life and health.

At the same time, criminalizing abortion appears to do little to protect life before birth. Indeed, data from multiple studies, including by the World Health Organization (WHO), strongly suggests that people experiencing unwanted pregnancies seek access to abortion services even in highly punitive legal situations.

And while criminalizing abortion has done little to protect life before birth, it has too often undermined the rights of women and girls, including by putting their lives at risk. Abortion restrictions push women and girls seeking abortions, especially those in poverty and who live in rural areas, out of the national health system and into clandestine, unregulated settings. Many clandestine abortions are performed unsafely, leading to short- or long-term health problems, or even death.

According to the WHO, the rate of unsafe abortions is four times higher in countries with restrictive abortion laws than in countries where abortion is legal. In Argentina, abortions are “generally” performed under unsafe conditions, according to a 2015 Ministry of Health report. In 2018, Adolfo Rubinstein, health minister during the administration of former President Mauricio Macri, estimated that 70 percent of abortions in the country were carried out in unsafe conditions. According to the WHO, unsafe abortion is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in Argentina.

Additionally, the current model in Argentina—which forbids abortions except in specific circumstances—in practice does not work and often means that women and girls have not been able to access abortions even when those exceptions apply. A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on research in five provinces and the City of Buenos Aires, showed that doctors and local health authorities often impose arbitrary and unlawful barriers to women seeking abortions under the exceptions allowed by law. These include when their life or health is at risk or because they have been victims of rape. Forcing women to continue their pregnancies under such circumstances imposes an undue burden and could amount to degrading treatment.

Given the evidence and authoritative interpretations of human rights law in favor of ensuring access to abortion, it is not surprising that many developed countries—including the United States and members of the European Union—have laws allowing women and girls to end their pregnancies on request.

Argentina should join them. The Senate has a landmark opportunity to put an end to a rule that has put the rights of women and girls at risk. They should seize it."

Her destination was the Rogue Valley Manor, a hilltop retirement community founded by three Protestant churches. Accompanied by a San Francisco church official named Craig N. Palmer, she arrived on a rain-swept Monday afternoon, a few weeks before Easter.

A long drive led up to a 10-story apartment building. They stepped into a light-filled reception area brimming with lilies—a traditional Christian symbol of purity. Ina was struck by the contrast between their dark undertaking and the ethereal setting. Turning to Palmer, she said, “This looks like we’re in heaven.”

At the reception desk, Ina and Palmer asked for a resident named Dick Wichman. The receptionist asked if they meant Franz. In a nod to his German heritage, Wichman had dropped the nickname Dick and let the Rogue Valley Manor staff know that he preferred to be called by his baptismal name.

Journalist Julia Flynn Siler discussed this story with Alta Asks Live and author Grace Hwang Lynch.

The receptionist asked them to wait, explaining that Wichman was “in the chapel right now” but would be there shortly. Eventually, an old man, bald, with bright blue eyes, and wearing a dark purple shirt, approached, smiling and using a walker. Wichman had been expecting them.

Riding an elevator up to his apartment, they were met with a spectacular view of the surrounding green landscape. The 94-year-old had lived alone there since the death of his wife four years earlier.

Wichman insisted that Ina and Palmer enjoy looking toward Roxy Ann Peak in the Western Cascades while he sat with his back turned to the picture window. On the walls and shelves were dozens of photos from his days as a pastor in which he appeared with his arms slung casually over the shoulders of Chinese boys.

The therapist has one word for the experience of at long last meeting and confronting the predatory former pastor, whom she and Palmer hoped would finally apologize to his victims.

“Chilling.”



The predator: F.S. Dick Wichman. Picasa

“They loved me, and I was doing my job.”

The charismatic man who would later be known as Grandpa Dick first arrived in San Francisco’s Chinatown around 1940. A few months before his ordination as a Presbyterian minister, he had written to a national church official to ask for a job and express his “keen interest in specialized work with boys and young people.” Salaries, he noted, “do not enter into our thinking,” referring to himself and his bride.

After a brief stint as a “boys worker” at a church for Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, F.S. “Dick” Wichman returned to San Francisco in 1942 and began organizing programs for the Chinatown YMCA. Five years later, the hip pastor who wore jeans and a clerical collar was hired as the executive director of nearby Cameron House. Then in his mid-30s, Wichman rolled up his sleeves to renovate the old building and soon brought his programs and some of the YMCA boys over to his new job.

Cameron House had been founded as the Occidental Board Presbyterian Mission House in 1874 by a small group of churchwomen who decided there was a need for a safe house for trafficked Chinese girls. From its chaotic early days to a triumphant court case in the 1930s in which the leaders of a major human-trafficking ring were convicted, the home was a refuge. Up until the late 1930s, it employed a doorkeeper to make sure that men who might be traffickers or sex abusers stayed out. Over this long history, Cameron House was run by a staff of white and Asian women.

Siler was interviewed about her work on this article and more.

READ ""Talking with Julia Flynn Siler""

The house at 920 Sacramento Street was an important institution in Chinatown in the second half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, especially for vulnerable girls and women who had recently arrived from China. But after its long-serving superintendent Donaldina Cameron retired in the late 1930s, the church decided to turn the battered brick building into a language school. A decade later, leaders saw a need for summer programs for kids in Chinatown who otherwise would be roaming the neighborhood’s alleys with nothing to do. They repurposed Cameron House into a community center focusing on youth, and they hired Wichman as its first male director.

Thousands of Chinatown’s boys and girls went on to participate in its programs over the years. Many became leaders in their community. But Cameron House entered a grim chapter in its history after Wichman arrived in 1947. Under his leadership, it was transformed from what had been a refuge for girls and young women who’d been sexually abused into a place that was profoundly unsafe for boys and young men. By one count, there are 40 known victims of Wichman—all of whom he raped or molested when they were boys, and most of whom were Chinese American. Some estimate the actual number may be in the hundreds. The abuse took place over decades.

“For years, I didn’t feel comfortable walking into Cameron House,” says Noël Chun, a San Francisco–based artist and business owner who began participating in the youth programs as an 11-year-old in 1965 and became one of Wichman’s many victims. “There was this unspoken tragedy that happened in the building.… One of the most tragic parts of the abuse is that in this sort of insulated community, with all these other adults around, it happened over such a long period of time.”

Only now is Cameron House fully grappling with this horrific history, including its racial aspects. A short documentary released this year, Our Healing Journey, relates how both the institution and some of Wichman’s individual victims have begun to heal. But the story is far darker and more complex than the title of the documentary suggests. Wichman’s decades of unchecked abuse are a case study of a type of sexual predation in which perpetrators take advantage of cultural norms that keep their victims from speaking out. The story is also about the effects of white supremacy on a tightly knit Chinese community—and how that community finally overcame its long silence to acknowledge the truth.

“OK, now this is personal—’cause that’s one of my kids.”

Stocky and barrel-chested, the Reverend F.S. Wichman led Cameron House as its executive director from 1947 to 1977, remaining connected to it for another decade after his official retirement. He seemed to tower over his young charges. He’d lean down to press his face against their cheeks in what he called “whisker rubs” and to wrap them in full-body bear hugs.

Also called Dad and Papa Dick by generations of families in San Francisco’s Chinatown, Wichman was considered by many of his congregants to be a brilliant minister. He became the bridge between the Presbyterian Church’s national organization and the Chinatown community. In addition to leading Cameron House, he was a co-pastor of the nearby Presbyterian Church in Chinatown, the first Asian American church in North America. He inspired many youth-program participants—two dozen or more—to become ordained by the church.

Church membership grew under Wichman’s watch, and he led a rapid expansion of Cameron House’s youth programs. The day camps alone enrolled more than 1,000 kids some summers. Under his leadership, Cameron House reoriented its focus from vulnerable girls to boys. Wichman handpicked mostly male leaders for key roles in running the youth programs. Reporting to two church organizations, the Presbyterian Church’s National Board of Missions and the San Francisco Presbytery, a regional administrative group for churches in four Bay Area counties, Wichman gained renown for his work and traveled the country giving sermons. He was even awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity in 1964 by Westminster College in Salt Lake City.

The nearly four decades Wichman spent in Chinatown, first at the YMCA and then as Cameron House’s executive director, were a pivotal time in what some historians would later call the American Century. He arrived at Cameron House just after World War II, when Chinatown had transformed itself into a glamorous nightlife destination with clubs such as Forbidden City, the Kubla Khan, and Shangri-La. The status of Chinese Americans had dramatically shifted after China had become an ally of the United States: the Chinese Exclusion Act, in its various forms, had been lifted in 1943, filling Chinatown with optimism. At the same time, a generational shift was underway in the 1940s, as second-generation Chinese Americans for the first time became the majority of the ethnic Chinese population in the United States.

Wichman encouraged self-exploration and social engagement among his young charges, focusing on leadership training as the country moved through the Cold War, the Kennedy years, and the Asian American rights movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. As he wrote in 1962, he saw Cameron House’s mission as “mediating the love of Christ to the destitute, the rejected, and the oppressed of its community and neighborhood” and making “the Gospel relevant to the disorders of the day.”

A large number of San Francisco’s future civic leaders came through the Cameron House youth programs in the 1960s, including the Reverend Norman Fong, who went on to head the powerful Chinatown Community Development Center, and the Reverend Harry Chuck, who led the fight for low-income housing in the neighborhood as Wichman’s successor. The Reverend Calvin Chinn and Marion Kwan were two “Cameron House kids” who marched with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma.

As the environmental movement grew in the 1960s and ’70s, Wichman also showed thousands of kids from densely packed Chinatown the beauty of redwood groves and the Sierra Nevada, some for the first time. For decades, he owned a cabin in Marin County near Muir Woods and organized overnight and weeklong summer outings, the kind of trips that many families could not otherwise afford. Known as Dick’s Cabin, the rustic structure was about a 15-minute hike from the entrance to Muir Woods. Sometimes the kids would go on hikes through the redwoods.

In 1977, Wichman retired with a full pension from the Presbyterian Church. He chose Chuck as his successor from among the many young men he’d mentored through the youth programs and inspired to join the ministry. After he retired, Wichman, as “pastor emeritus,” continued to visit some of his favorite parishioners and “boys” at their homes and colleges. He also welcomed their visits to the Presbyterian retirement home in Los Gatos, where he and his wife, Lois, a fellow seminarian, had settled after moving out of the rooms they’d occupied at Cameron House.

One such visitor was a troubled 15-year-old named David Hall, the adopted son of church elder Sharlene Hall, who’d grown up at Cameron House and regarded Wichman as a surrogate father. Hall urged her son to visit the family’s beloved pastor in Los Gatos in 1977, only to learn, a decade later, that during that visit, “Grandpa [Dick] had tried to get into his underpants.” Hall, who has struggled with her guilt over that for decades, says, “It just blows my mind I was so naïve.”

“I looked to [Wichman] for my moral compass.”

In 1987, a decade after his retirement, Wichman returned to San Francisco for a blowout party at a cavernous warehouse pier at the historic Fort Mason Center. Inside, volunteers tried to tie colorful helium balloons securely enough so they wouldn’t float up to the 50-foot ceiling. The party, a celebration of his 75th birthday, was also the occasion for Cameron House’s annual fundraiser. Planning it had taken a year, nearly a thousand people came, and sponsors included Pacific Bell, the U.S. Leasing Corp., the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, and the YMCA.

Wichman, bald and bespectacled, wore a flower lei around his neck as the guest of honor. One of the partygoers was Elaine Chan-Scherer, a 28-year-old former Cameron House staffer. She was seated toward the front as she listened to Wichman’s remarks, in which he joked about what he called the “deserved whisker rubs” campers got for being late to a camp meal, described himself as “an opportunist for Christ,” and admitted to such misbehavior as dumping kids in a pool and pushing them down mountain slopes.

“The perpetrator stands before you,” he said.

It wasn’t so much the retired pastor’s attempts at humor that unsettled Chan-Scherer. Rather, it was the chill she felt after hearing one of the former youth program participants fondly recall skinny-dipping at night with him. Many summers, Wichman had organized excursions to a Presbyterian retreat called Westminster Woods, in Sonoma County. On those trips, Wichman and the boys would strip off their clothes and jump into the pool at night, a ritual that came to be called a “chocolate swim” because the naked swimming was followed by hot chocolate and cookies. This nighttime activity—which was mandatory—sometimes involved such games as keep-away, in which boys or the burly pastor himself would pounce on the person holding the ball.

And then there was the song performed for the party’s guest of honor. Set to the tune of the 1970 hit “Mill Valley,” the lyrics had been rewritten to jokingly refer to the many youth clubs Wichman had helped establish. The new lines also referenced the rashes the boys would get—nubs—because the pastor would rub his face on theirs.

And Dick likes all the crazy clubs, he lets them know with his whisker rubs

And that is why all the kids around, have the nubs

These often-told stories—Dick’s whisker rubs, the nighttime swims, how Christianity offered these boys opportunities they would otherwise never have been given—would soon take on a new, sordid meaning for the community.

At the time of the party, a former participant in the Cameron House youth programs was rumored to be on his deathbed with AIDS. He died two days after the celebration. His mother had discovered love letters from Wichman to her son and had learned from those letters that her son had been afraid of the now-retired pastor. That alarmed Chan-Scherer, who knew the family of the participant. Chan-Scherer had become a social worker and was aware of California’s Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, passed in 1980, which required her to report instances of suspected child sex abuse.

Soon after the party, Chan-Scherer heard that Wichman had tried to French-kiss one of the kids she had worked with at Cameron House, while visiting him at his college campus. She’d heard rumors before, but nothing so specific. “I thought, OK, now this is personal—’cause that’s one of my kids,” recalls Chan-Scherer. “I knew that I had to say something.”

She approached the pastor at the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown in December 1987, about two months after the party at Fort Mason. Acting as a whistleblower, she shared the stories she had heard. The San Francisco Presbytery began investigating. Nine men testified under oath to a church disciplinary committee that Wichman had sexually molested them when they were between the ages of 14 and 16. Those instances of abuse had happened over decades. The hearings were held behind closed doors.

One of the victims who testified before the committee was Noël Chun. He was also one of the first to go public with their story. Chun, like many of Wichman’s victims, grew up in a fatherless household. He’d been raised by a single mother of three in the Tenderloin and first went to Cameron House as a middle schooler. He joined youth groups, played basketball, and eventually became a leader and one of Wichman’s favorites—the powerful pastor offered him praise and love in a way that Chun now sees was a form of grooming. Wichman became a surrogate father to him, so when the married pastor invited him, at 16, to sleep in his private bedroom with him at the cabin, the teenager welcomed the attention.

Their sexual relationship, which included penetrative sex, continued from 1970 into the 1980s, after Wichman had retired and Chun had become a legal adult. The damage was lasting. By 1988, Chun’s first marriage had collapsed because of his infidelity. “I looked to [Wichman] for my moral compass, and he just sort of warped that,” he recalls. Chun’s second marriage also failed, for similar reasons.

In late 1988, after the San Francisco Presbytery’s closed-door investigation, Chun entered the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown for a congregational meeting to discuss what the disciplinary committee had discovered about the retired pastor. Then in his mid-30s, Chun sat toward the back of the packed sanctuary, which could hold hundreds of people for worship services. Well respected by the community, he’d served as a deacon and an elder in the church.

Some congregants refused to believe the anonymous stories the committee shared and were angry. Chun raised his hand and stood up. “I’m a victim,” he told the gathering. His revelation was shocking. He’s forgotten much of what happened next, but he left early. “That day changed my relationship to the church,” he recalls, and over the next few months he realized that people he’d grown up with and worshipped with for many years thought he was lying. Not being believed was “devastating,” he says, and he lost trust in the institutional church.

The allegations deeply divided Chinatown. Some in the community refused to believe that their beloved pastor could have sexually molested children and teens. Since the San Francisco Presbytery had chosen to seal the findings of its investigation, their names and stories were never publicly revealed. Some parishioners actively defended Wichman. “There was a great deal of denial,” explains Reverend Chuck, who first met Wichman at the Chinatown YMCA in the early 1940s and was one of the boys who followed him to Cameron House. “He was like a father figure to a lot of us.”

In “a statement of Charges and Specifications,” the church’s disciplinary committee planned to bring five specific charges against Wichman, including “adultery (for sexual activity with boys under the age of 18 while married), perjury (for continuing to deny inappropriate sexual activity) and inappropriate interference in the governance of Cameron House and the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown,” which would have led to a formal church trial by the San Francisco Presbytery. However, Wichman denied everything and formally left the Presbyterian faith in November 1988—in a process called demitting—before proceedings could get underway. The committee had consulted the San Francisco district attorney’s office about pressing criminal charges but had been told that the statute of limitations for sexual abuse cases had run out. (The lawyer from the D.A.’s office who met with church officials could not be reached for comment.) Meanwhile, more victims began stepping forward.

About three years after Wichman quit the faith, he and his wife left California and moved to the Rogue Valley Manor in Medford. Then, in 1996, California’s Supreme Court retroactively extended the statute of limitations, which meant that Wichman’s victims could file criminal charges against him in the state. Writing to friends to tell them of their move, the Wichmans lovingly described the property, with its Olympic-size swimming pool, bowling greens, computer room, and private walking trails. They wrote that they did miss their more “cosmopolitan” life in California and that “Oregon is white in more ways than their [sic] snow-capped mountains.”

But overall, they described their new home as “heaven.”

“The place felt like the Bates Motel in Psycho.”

A glaring racial issue cut through the scandal—a white clergyman had abused Chinese boys for decades without anyone doing anything about it. Wichman, who didn’t speak Chinese, regularly betrayed a contempt for Chinese culture and language. “I remember he used to mispronounce Chinese just to make fun of our language,” Reverend Chinn notes. “And we would let him get away with it; we didn’t challenge him.” Chinn, who was a pastor at the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown from 1990 until he retired in 2006 and who was also one of Wichman’s victims, recalls that Wichman tried to “squelch people at Cameron House” who were involved in the Asian American civil rights movement of the 1960s and ’70s.

During an era when Asian American students at San Francisco State University and elsewhere went on strike to demand ethnic studies programs, Wichman built many of Cameron House’s programs around his own family’s German traditions and songs. There was no celebration of Chinese New Year, even though the surrounding neighborhood resounded with the pop of fireworks and the drumming from parades featuring colorful lion dancers. Instead, the mostly Chinese kids at Cameron House would mark the pastor’s birthday in October with a celebration dubbed National Chocolate Sunday that included performances of German folk songs like “Lina, My Lina, Her Second Name Is Biddle.” “Chinese was inferior” to Wichman, Chinn recalls. “Anything associated with Chinese was not good enough.”

Wichman worked with many second-generation and third-generation Chinese American kids who spoke English and were more assimilated into mainstream American culture than their parents. Many parents of children who attended the youth programs at Cameron House, as new immigrants from China, spoke little or no English. During Wichman’s decades as co-pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown, he added an English-speaking-only congregation of youth—which worshipped in Cameron House’s big hall as well as the nearby church. The effect was to shift power away from the Chinese-speaking church elders and toward the English-speaking pastor—and to further separate the English-speaking youth from their parents.

Language and cultural barriers also contributed to a sense of paralysis and powerlessness in the years following the San Francisco Presbytery’s stymied efforts to seek justice. Chuck and local Presbyterian Church authorities mostly chose not to continue to pursue or publicly air concerns about Wichman, in part because the statute of limitations had run out, but also because Cameron House was undergoing an expensive earthquake retrofit and fundraising had become a priority. There was a fear that talking about Wichman’s abuse would undermine support for the effort. Cameron House and the Presbytery failed to “actively encourage a full exploration of the truth,” according to a 2003 report to Cameron House’s board of directors. When the subject did come up during a Lenten discussion series in 1998, a longtime congregant verbally attacked Chinn as the pastor who had broached it.

There was institutional confusion as well: Wichman had reported—at least on paper—to both the national and the regional Presbyterian Church. With many changes in personnel and reporting relationships over the decades, there had been spotty oversight, giving him the “freedom to lead as he saw fit,” says Palmer, who in June 2006 was brought in to serve as the head of the San Francisco Presbytery by the church’s national organization.

Shame on the part of the victims also contributed to those years of silence. Some didn’t think they’d be believed over the word of a powerful and popular pastor—a common occurrence in cases of clergy sex abuse. “Who’s going to take the word of a dumb Chinaman, or a dumb Chinaman’s parents, against him, the great white hope?” former Cameron House board chair Greg Chan says, referring to Wichman. “It’s like white privilege exponentially on steroids. If you can go into a community and rape their little boys” without apparent consequences, says Chan, then “you think you can get away with it.”

“Anything associated with Chinese was not good enough.”

Fourteen years passed. In late 2001, an unassuming Chinese American woman named Doreen Der-McLeod stepped in as Cameron House’s new executive director. After a board meeting that year, Der-McLeod and then-chair Chan walked out to Cameron House’s small parking lot, off Joice Alley. Chan, a onetime youth group participant who had been abused by Wichman, said, “Doreen, we’ve got to do something about this…” “The place,” he says, “felt like the Bates Motel in Psycho.”

There is no doubt that Cameron House, rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake with salvaged clinker bricks, has long had a deeply unsettled atmosphere, stretching back to the 19th century, when desperate girls would hide in its basement to elude their captors. To this day, some consider it a haunted house. As Chan explains, “we had not cleaned up the shrouded energy,” in large part because of a feeling of shame. Together, Der-McLeod and Chan proposed establishing a Healing Task Force so the organization could fully confront the decades of abuse that had taken place under Wichman’s leadership.

The Catholic clergy abuse scandal was in the headlines at the time, and Cameron House faced its own potentially devastating financial fallout: its directors feared that fundraising could dry up if the accusations against the organization became public, and there was the graver risk of civil lawsuits. Then, in July 2002, California’s governor, Gray Davis, signed Senate Bill 1779, which opened a one-year window for lawsuits to be filed against employers and other responsible third parties in child sex abuse cases.

It was an existential threat to Cameron House. “We had to walk on eggs. We just hoped we wouldn’t bring the institution down because we were trying to do right,” Chan recalls, referring to its decision to publicly acknowledge the wrong done to Wichman’s victims.

The Healing Task Force, which consisted of past and present church members and youth-program participants, met with survivors and secondary victims (such as spouses) for a year and a half. After its formation, more victims began coming forward, eventually bringing the total to 18. In November 2003, the task force delivered a 53-page report to Cameron House’s board. The report included anonymous but detailed first-person accounts of the abuse by 12 of Wichman’s primary and secondary victims. The task force told the board that it believed the allegations against Grandpa Dick.

The accounts revealed that Wichman had caused both physical and spiritual harm. As one survivor wrote, “Dick was a monster who lived among us disguised as a good, caring individual. Outfitted with religious collar and ecclesiastical vestments, wielding the symbols of authority, and with the cloak of moral superiority and righteousness, he was able to seduce, manipulate, and cajole an impressionable and trusting audience of adolescents.”

As another put it, referring to Wichman’s denial of the abuse, “I’m enormously disturbed by his lying. My disillusionment is monumental. Not because he was a pervert. But because of his lies. I couldn’t stand being around ministers or churches for ten years because I was so unglued by what a bunch of weak, dishonest liars so many of them are. Thanks, Dick.”

One of the young men who told their story to the task force was Clinton Huey, whose account was among the 12 printed anonymously in the report. Huey began participating in a Cameron House youth program as a high school junior in 1968. Coming from a difficult family situation, he was inspired by Wichman, who seemed to be the physically affectionate father figure he’d never had. After Huey chaired the annual Cameron House Carnival, Wichman invited him to spend the night at the Marin cabin alone with him and to share his bed.

Huey agreed, but when Wichman began touching him in a way that felt sexual, Huey asked him to stop, which he did. The next morning, the young man brought up what had happened the previous night, asking Wichman why he needed that kind of affection. Wichman answered: “I give so much of myself to the community. I need to get something back.”

The response left Huey with a profound sense of betrayal. “He was a representation of God in my life,” he explains. He wanted “something sexual back for giving to the community?” But Huey, who was 23 when this took place, decided, like so many others, to keep quiet about his experience, because he didn’t want to stir things up or jeopardize all the good that he still felt Cameron House did for the community.

The Reverend Bradford Woo, who participated in the task force and was also a victim, explains that Huey’s and many others’ long silence reflected, in part, traditional Chinese cultural values: respect your elders, know your place, keep emotions and sexuality private. And it was those same values that gave Wichman, as an authority figure, an opportunity as a serial abuser. “These worked in his favor as he was grooming and scanning through these thousands of boys” who came through Cameron House, says Woo, who took part in the youth programs and later became a Cameron House staffer and an ordained minister. Parts of the Christian gospel also played into Wichman’s hands as he encouraged the boys to leave behind their families and follow both Wichman and Jesus.

Against the backdrop of the sexual liberation movement of the 1960s and ’70s, Wichman’s physical affection toward his young charges appeared open-minded and “American” to some of the boys, in contrast to the behavior of their own parents, who seemed old-

fashioned and reserved. But Wichman, like many predators, paid special attention to fragile boys—those from broken families or who lived in situations where the father was absent in some way. There was a pattern to his predation: he would groom, or show favor to, youths who needed love and affection—and weren’t protected by fathers.

One of those boys was Buddy Tate Choy, whose father had died when he was 7. At 13, he started receiving Wichman’s attentions. After the first public stories of Wichman’s abuse surfaced in late 1987 and early 1988, Choy started having nightmares. In a memory he recovered during that time, he recalled attending a large youth-congregation gathering or rally at Cameron House and being asked by Wichman to accompany him downstairs to a basement room known as the Log Cabin, whose wooden walls were hung with deer antlers. In the dark, Wichman said that “God would be closer to [Choy] if [he] did not have [his] clothes on.”

Choy remembered Wichman’s large hands on him and his sour, sweaty smell, like a locker room or spoiled milk. “I felt like I was going to vomit.”

Wichman took the boy’s penis in his hand. Choy could hear the gathering upstairs, as the kids sang hymns, and then Wichman praying. “Then I remember being back upstairs at the rally as if nothing had happened.”

Wichman continued the abuse for four years, until Choy left for college. Both Choy and his wife, Jeanne Choy Tate, believe that the emotional damage the pastor caused has affected him and his family: Choy ended up a convicted felon for embezzling funds from a Chinatown community organization. His family became secondary victims. He attempted suicide and suffered from mood swings and bursts of rage. The family struggled financially for many years.

“It just took a great toll on us,” Jeanne Choy Tate said.

“I remember being back upstairs at the rally as if nothing had happened.”

Cameron House’s leaders came to believe that these painful truths must be acknowledged before healing could begin. As the Healing Task Force encouraged people to share their stories, survivors like Choy began finding the courage and support to speak openly about their experiences. Both Cameron House and the Presbyterian Church formally acknowledged the abuse and apologized for Wichman’s “broken trust and abuse of authority” in 2004; the San Francisco Presbytery formally apologized a year later, in 2005.

No criminal or civil suits were ever filed against Wichman, Cameron House, or the local or national Presbyterian Church, despite the pastor’s decades of abuse and the institutional failure to stop it. But some victims did want compensation. In 2004, the national church provided $247,500 in funds for therapy and retreats for victims and their families—a group of several dozen people at that point.

That sum was about a quarter of what some members of the task force had originally requested and far less than what might have been paid out if victims had brought civil suits against Cameron House or the national Presbyterian Church. Their acknowledgment of Wichman’s abuse, however, stands in contrast to the Catholic Church’s well-documented history of transferring priests to other parishes to dodge liability for sex abuse.

Therapy sessions played a key role in Cameron House’s healing. Starting in about 2003, Satsuki Ina became the main therapist treating Wichman’s victims. Paid from church funds until that money ran out, she continued to work with the survivors and their families for almost a decade. She came to know their stories intimately.

Noël Chun helped form the survivors group at Cameron House, which initially met at his home. He also underwent weekly two-hour individual therapy sessions with Ina for 10 years—in the beginning driving about 90 miles, from San Francisco to Sacramento, to meet with her. Having struggled with suicidal thoughts, he credits Ina with saving his life.

By 2007, both Ina and San Francisco Presbytery head Palmer realized that for healing to take place, they needed to confront Wichman with the stories of abuse in person, instead of only through emails and letters, which Wichman had stopped responding to. Survivors told the therapist that they wanted acknowledgment from Wichman of the harm he’d done to them. Palmer and Ina hoped that in a face-to-face meeting Wichman would take responsibility for his decades of abuse and apologize to the survivors.

“I was very aware of how powerfully seductive [Wichman] could be.”

By the time Ina visited Oregon on March 26, 2007, the therapist had spent three years working with Wichman’s victims. Palmer, meanwhile, had been appointed interim executive of the organizationally stressed San Francisco Presbytery nine months earlier. Assigned as a troubleshooter by the national organization, he was the first church representative to attend a survivors meeting and, now, to personally meet with Wichman. Both felt tense as they prepared to confront a man who’d caused so much pain.

Wichman greeted them graciously and was animated, despite his physical frailty. Once they reached his apartment, he led them to the picture window. “It’s hard to decide whether to look east or west,” he said, perhaps trying to charm them. But he then asserted, “I renounced and am no longer part of the church. I don’t understand why you are here.”

Palmer explained, “I was brought in to help the Presbytery move forward. The effect of your abuse on the entire Presbytery and its efforts towards healing….”

“You mean you think I caused the problems of the Presbytery?” Wichman asked, adding that although he’d been sent to see a psychiatrist after the church’s 1987 investigation, the doctor had “said there was nothing wrong with me.”

Wichman continued to maintain that he didn’t know what he was accused of or who was saying such things about him.

The therapist listened to the exchange between the two men. “I was very aware of how powerfully seductive he could be,” says Ina, recalling his apparent incredulity at being confronted with the accusations. She was also struck by how articulate Wichman was, displaying an ability to remember details from more than half a century earlier about Cameron House life, including facts about so many of the boys and their family situations.

Wichman was well prepared for their visit. His daughter, who lived in California, telephoned him during their meeting to check on how it was going. Ina sensed that Wichman’s daughter had advised him beforehand not only about where to seat the guests but also about not admitting to any wrongdoing. Wichman’s son, John F. Wichman, who is a Presbyterian minister in the Bay Area, declined to comment for this story. “I am uncomfortable about being interviewed about my father,” he wrote in an email.

Ina shared with Wichman the stories she’d heard from the members of the Cameron House survivors group—about the skinny-dipping at night; his asking the boys at the cabin, “Who gets to share my bed?”; and the numerous instances of Wichman’s full-body bear hug in which the boys could feel the pastor’s erection beneath his trousers.

Wichman batted off the stories. He answered in a way that implicitly acknowledged their truth but downplayed their importance. He also reshaped them so that he would appear in a more flattering light. “Chinese people are so uptight,” Ina recalls him telling them. “Their parents don’t have an understanding of healthy sexuality.… I wanted these boys to experience freedom.”

The former pastor repeatedly reframed the stories to minimize any wrongdoing on his part, Palmer recalls. A typical response was “No, it didn’t happen like that. Yes, we went to the cabin, and we slept together, but I never penetrated anyone. That is something I would never do. I would rub up against him, and my penis would get hard, but there was never any penetration.”

The therapist also shared one survivor’s account of Wichman tapping him on the shoulder during a youth gathering as a signal to follow him into a private area. The boy then performed oral sex on the minister, after which Wichman asked him to kneel and pray. He then sent the boy back to the gathering.

Ina pointed out to him that the victim was a prepubescent boy just entering his teens at the time. Wichman’s responses to her many examples were similar: “He’s the one that wanted to be intimate,” or “That one, you know, really had a strong attachment to me.”

Wichman explained to his visitors that the boys wanted and needed his love and that he was helping them explore their identities.

After nearly two hours, as the view out the window darkened, Ina and Palmer realized that Wichman wouldn’t apologize. He seemed to have convinced himself that he hadn’t harmed anyone. “They loved me, and I was doing my job,” Ina recalls him explaining. “I don’t know why people would want to hurt me after all I’ve given to that community.”

Palmer felt numb with disbelief at Wichman’s words. He concluded the meeting, explaining that the church condemned Wichman’s behavior and believed that he had molested the boys and caused great harm to them and their families.

Wichman continued to wear a “flat-looking smile,” Ina recalls, and didn’t outwardly react to this denunciation from the church he’d devoted his life to.

Instead, he asked them, “Would you like to stay for dinner?” It was nearly 6:30 p.m.

Reeling from Wichman’s apparent disconnect from the stories they’d shared of his decades-long pattern of predatory pedophilia, they declined the invitation. They rode the elevator down to the ground floor, passed through the reception area filled with lilies and their sickly-sweet scent, and exited the building.

Palmer turned to Ina. It was early evening, and the dusky sky was threatening rain.

“Do you feel like we’ve been sitting with pure evil?” Palmer asked.

Ina looked at him. “You know, I’m a Buddhist. So I don’t think about things like that,” she said. “But if I were a Christian, I would totally agree with you.”

Wichman died less than three months later, on June 19, 2007. He never expressed guilt or remorse for his actions—even shortly before his death, according to the Rogue Valley Manor chaplain at the time, who visited him the week before he died.

The victims of Wichman’s abuse never received a full or formal apology from him. Jeanne Choy Tate, a longtime member of the Healing Task Force, continues to press the local and national Presbyterian Church for change based on input from survivors of clergy abuse. She has kept a tally of 40 known Wichman victims. The task force’s 2019 report counted 18 known victims but acknowledged that the number was probably much higher—more than 40 and possibly as many as 100.

But while the unresolved history hung over Cameron House and the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown like a gloomy cloud for more than 30 years, it is finally starting to lift. Echoing its early history as a safe house, 920 Sacramento Street’s healing process began with a group of women.

Chan-Scherer, among others, felt that Donaldina Cameron, who’d worked selflessly for decades to protect vulnerable girls and young women, would have been “rolling in her grave” if she had learned of Wichman’s crimes. The pastor took the trust built over decades by Cameron and the other women who founded and ran the home, and he used it, in part, to brazenly abuse boys.

Other faith communities have recently turned to Cameron House for guidance on how to grapple with the aftermath of clergy sex abuse, including, according to Ina, a Catholic community ministering to Japanese Canadians. After a quarter century, and countless therapy sessions, community meetings, reports, the trip to Oregon to confront Wichman, an art installation, and a documentary film about the experience, the Cameron House community has brought this history to light and begun to recover from it. “We’re not healed until we can talk about the good and the bad that Dick brought,” task force participant Reverend Woo says.

Noël Chun, who was among the first to stand up and publicly reveal that he had been a victim, stayed away from Cameron House for many years. But now he, among others, has started to return. He has become a financial supporter again, in part because he believes in the work the organization does through its social services department. He has also reconnected with childhood friends.

He wrote two poems, now displayed in Cameron House’s chapel, about the journey that he and other survivors have undertaken together. A passage from one of them reads:

We have traveled for many years,

The Truth now spoken.

And no longer living with fear…

Theoretically, if the DOL did clarify that workers can stay home and collect unemployment if they feel unsafe, that could put thousands of home-based care workers in the position to opt out of their jobs for the time being.

One executive order, for example, laid the groundwork for a $15 minimum wage. The “Fight for $15” has long been a complicated issue for America’s home-based care operators, many of whom want to pay their workers more but struggle with stagnating reimbursement rates.



In addition to that, Biden also plans to increase the unemployment benefits add-on by $100 to $400 per week once the current spending package expires in March.

Anecdotally, providers haven’t been too concerned about the additional benefits. But there’s another aspect of Biden’s plan that could make it into a larger issue.



A fact sheet released by the Biden administration on Jan. 22 says that “workers have a federally guaranteed right to refuse employment that will jeopardize their health, and if they do so, they will still qualify for unemployment insurance.”



That is a part of the “new executive actions” to “deliver economic relief for American families and businesses amid the COVID-19 crises,” according to the fact sheet.

Specifically, Biden is asking the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to consider clarifying that workers do have the right to opt out of work if they fear it is unsafe for them or their families.

Further guidance on which types of workers would apply has not yet been provided.



“The Biden package could certainly create some incremental headwinds for home-based care staffing, as we saw in the summer months last year after the first iteration of the CARES Act implemented the $600-per-week unemployment assistance,” Scott Fidel, an analyst for the financial services firm Stephens Inc., told Home Health Care News in an email last week. “However, we would not expect the staffing challenges to not be as significant as what we saw last year following the CARES Act.”



But with that potential DOL provision, things could get tricky for both home health and home care providers.



Theoretically, if the DOL did clarify that workers can stay home and collect unemployment if they feel unsafe, that could put thousands of home-based care workers in the position to opt out of their jobs for the time being.



Home care agencies have used hazard pay from Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans in an attempt to mitigate some of these issues.

Likewise, hazard pay from the government was supposed to fill holes on the home health side.



Particularly when it comes to Medicaid reimbursement, however, hazard pay has come late and been subject to high taxes. That’s at least the case in Virginia, where checks came in up to three months late and with a 35% chunk taken out for taxes, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.



Hazard pay can encourage workers to stay on the job and risk their own well-being, but it’s often not enough to overcome concerns about potentially exposing high-risk family members back home.



In 2019, 43% of American households reported having at least one member with pre-existing conditions.



“President Biden believes that workers should have the right to safe work environments and that no one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own or their families’ health,” the fact sheet states.

Five sources speaking to VICE World News on the condition of anonymity and one named source allege the company, acquired by U.S. private investment firm Bain Capital in 2013, has failed to meet basic workplace standards. Those interviewed described inadequate sanitation and PPE distribution and a padlocked emergency exit, in addition to intimidation documented by the Manitoba Labour Board.

Workers in Winnipeg are participating in a social media campaign launched by Workers United this week to galvanize support for unionization and expose what they say are unacceptable working conditions.

“The majority of the workforce in Canada Goose’s Winnipeg factories are immigrant women. Workers report having been forced to deal with low piecemeal rates, and, without a union, no real say over working conditions,” a statement released by Canada Goose Workers United Thursday morning said.

After leaving southern Asia for Dubai, Maria made her way to Canada and found work as a sewer at Canada Goose. She alleged the working conditions she experienced in Dubai were similar to those in the Canada Goose factory.

“You can feel sometimes there is no future at all for you,” said Maria, whose name has been changed out of fear of retribution from management. “A big horn blows and we have to get back and rush as you lose money from (your) paycheque for any lateness.”

“We came here for a better life from a country with no government support and (inadequate) health facilities,” she added. “Before I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it’s the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.”

A Filipino worker said she felt physically threatened by a white manager for talking to her co-worker. “She saw us from 3 metres away talking and (started) shouting at us and raised her fist as she came toward us as if to hit us,” she said. The manager walked away without further incident.

In another instance, the worker was fixing her machine when she said the manager started screaming at her. “I couldn’t even explain that the machine was broke, and she humiliated me in front of other workers and said there wouldn’t be pay for lost time,” she said.

“White management (treats) us differently as most of the employees here are immigrants and they scream at us, immigrants just trying to (grab onto) opportunities to earn money for our families,” she said.

A male factory worker also spoke of racialized workers being yelled at and treated with disrespect they alleged they had never witnessed directed at white workers—an allegation all the immigrant workers interviewed by VICE World News repeated. He specifically alleged watching managers stand behind older workers of colour and scream at them “like teenagers,”saying “‘Faster, faster, faster!’”

“It is the policy of Canada Goose that employees are treated with dignity, free from harassment and discrimination. All incidents of harassment that are reported are investigated as outlined in our whistleblower and harassment policies,” Canada Goose told VICE World News in a statement.

Since Canada Goose’s founding in 1957 by immigrant and Holocaust survivor Sam Tick, the company has marketed itself in different ways, first as a rugged outfitter for Arctic exploration, then as a luxury goods provider, and now as a socially conscientious and domestically manufactured combination of the two. The company’s progressive commitments include a partnership with nonprofit conservation group Polar Bears International, a line of parkas designed by Indigenous peoples, and philanthropic celebrity initiatives featuring Ryan Reynolds and Kate Upton.

Many of the winter jackets that endure as the company’s flagship product are manufactured in three recently constructed production facilities in Winnipeg, where workers’ alleged conditions approximate those in countries with more lax labour protections than Canada. The opening of those facilities came with significant fanfare, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister touring the workspace and touting Canada Goose for its job creation and “Made in Canada” apparel. Prior to the pandemic, more than 1,000 employees worked in Canada Goose’s three Winnipeg production facilities. The company also has three factories in Toronto and two in Montreal.

As its name implies, the Canada Goose brand is closely tied to its purported domestic production, even as the company’s non-winter-jacket products are manufactured elsewhere: knitwear in Italy and Romania, accessories in China, and rain jackets in Portugal. According to the company’s 2019 sustainability report, less than 50 percent of the company’s product came from manufacturing facilities owned and operated by Canada Goose, with 24 external Canadian suppliers, eight manufacturing partners in Europe and Asia, and 19 factories also in Europe and Asia.

Before the added hardships posed to front-line workers by COVID-19, workers in Canada Goose’s Winnipeg factories already struggled to earn a living wage by virtue of the piece rate quota system. While workers can exceed the provincial minimum wage of $11.90 by producing a higher number of garments then their baseline quota per hour, the piece rate can also be adjusted by management in a way that reduces additional pay. As the International Labor Office has documented, piece rate compensation in which workers are paid according to the number of garments they complete in an hour has been linked to negative effects on workers’ health.

“Our compensation system is comprised of both a guaranteed rate of pay, which guarantees the provincial minimum wage, as well as the opportunity to accelerate earnings through both skill and productivity multipliers. We follow all federal and provincial guidelines and requirements in regard to breaks,” Canada Goose told VICE World News in a statement.

All the workers who spoke to VICE World News said the quota system means that the number of pieces a sewer has to produce can change at any time, which can then lead to sewers working continuously for eight hours without taking a break. The company says it follows all provincial and federal rules on breaks.

As a company perk, workers are able to purchase discounted Canada Goose jackets, but even at 50 percent of their retail rate, the jackets can still be out of reach for workers who make less than $500 a week. “Our rate for pay is $11.90 an hour,” one female worker said. “For one week of work, that is still less money than (the) price of half off a $1,000 jacket.”

Canada Goose is controlled by Bain Capital, which acquired a majority stake in 2013 and took the company public in 2017. Since its founding, Bain Capital has emerged as a target for critics of the private equity industry, from the mid-1980s when U.S. Republican Senator Mitt Romney allegedly raised initial seed money from families linked to Central American death squads (Bain and Romney have denied the allegations) to the 2012 presidential primary when Romney faced attacks by Democrats over Bain Capital’s leveraged buyouts, which led to tens of thousands of workers losing retirement savings and health care plans.

In 2018 alone, some 33,000 workers were laid off without their expected severance or benefits after three private equity owners including Bain Capital restructured Toys “R” Us’s debt and collected more than $470 million in fees and debt obligations. Employees were eventually given less than half their expected severance and only after months of protests.

Last January, Bain Capital co-chair Stephen Pagliuca gave an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos about his company’s business practices. Clad in an all-black Canada Goose jacket, Pagliuca decried attacks on private equity as “politically motivated” and said that Bain Capital’s business model was grounded in growth, not the brutal debt-ladening and cost-cutting that have long served as the hallmarks of private equity predation. To illustrate his point, Pagliuca lavished praise on Canada Goose. At the time, Canada Goose’s stock market value had swelled to some $3.5 billion as the company expanded its reach into Chinese, U.S., and European markets.

A representative for Bain Capital directed VICE World News to Canada Goose for comment.

Last March, at the onset of the pandemic, Canada Goose secured contracts to produce PPE for hospital workers. Workers in its Toronto and Winnipeg manufacturing facilities were made to switch gears and manufacture PPE—but were not given adequate PPE themselves, the workers who spoke with VICE World News alleged.

“They give us only one cloth mask,” said the male factory worker. “I asked (my) supervisor for two masks but he said you can buy outside. When we protested, management gave us two cloth masks, but it was still not enough. Two masks you cannot use for month after month.”

Canada Goose said the reusable masks were in addition to unlimited disposable PPE. “The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Canada Goose, and we take it very seriously.”

The company added, “The health and safety protocols Canada Goose has put in place to reduce COVID-19 transmission are consistent across our facilities in Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba and includes more frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces, enforcing physical distancing, mask-wearing, and health declarations upon entering our buildings. PPE is available to all workers across all of our facilities including masks and gloves.

Our facilities, processes and supporting documents have been inspected and reviewed by Manitoba Workplace Safety & Health, Ontario Public Health, CNESST & Quebec Public Health. All have acknowledged that our COVID protections program meets or exceeds what is expected of employers.”

Workers also complained about the lack of adequate hand-sanitizing stations and said they were initially told to wash their hands in the bathroom after touching surfaces, even though that ate into their breaks and production time and forced them into an enclosed space. “Then after two or three months they put out one single sanitizer for three floors of sewers,” said the male worker.

“New hand sanitizer dispensers were installed at each of our Winnipeg facilities in 2019. This year, additional sanitizer stations have been placed throughout the building. As well, all sewing machines and workstations are disinfected every two hours throughout the workday,” Canada Goose said.

In August, Canada Goose closed the bathrooms sewers had been using for weeks to repair them, forcing them into 10 portable toilets outside the facility. Workers told VICE World News the portable toilets were cleaned so irregularly that workers opted to leave the premises to use the bathroom, having spouses pick them up at work or bringing portable receptacles to defecate into rather than risk infection.

According to reports from the nonprofit media organization PressProgress, when one worker complained to management, they were fired the same day. “No employees were terminated due to comments made about the toilets,” Canada Goose told VICE World News.

When two workers became infected with COVID-19 in November, workers said determining who was infected and where they were stationed within the factory was difficult, and made it hard to quarantine and decide whether or not to get tested.

Canada Goose said it investigates all reported COVID-19 cases, and that anyone in close contact with a positive employee is notified and asked to self-isolate.

Workers reported other safety violations unrelated to the pandemic. After a fire alarm began to sound on a factory floor in Winnipeg last November, sewers rushed to leave through an emergency exit, only to discover it was padlocked. Before realizing that there was not an actual fire, “a crowd started there at the door, and we... panicked because there is the fire alarm,” a sewer told VICE World News. “We are trying to get through the door, but it’s locked and we are afraid to have to go all through the building where there is a fire.” When workers confronted management over the incident, multiple workers said that they were told the door would remain locked.

The company now says it is unlocked. “There was one incident in which a door was locked during a drill. As soon as management was made aware of the situation it was unlocked with appropriate measures put in place to ensure it remains unlocked as required,” Canada Goose said.

While workers in the Toronto factory are unionized (with Workers United), those in Winnipeg are not. Alelie Sanvictores, a sewer and outspoken voice for unionization in one of Canada Goose’s Winnipeg factories, said that the hardships workers face have only increased since 2018 when workers in Winnipeg began a push for unionization. At the end of 2019, Canada Goose was able to successfully block their effort before Canada’s Labour Relations Board, arguing the union must expand its bargaining unit to seek certification. In the interim, Sanvictores said, many workers who were pro-union were pressured to move among three Canada Goose facilities in Manitoba.

“Any movement of workers across our facilities in Winnipeg is voluntary,” Canada Goose told VICE World News. “In 2019, the support required to form a union across all three Canada Goose locations in Winnipeg was not met. The Manitoba Labour Board rejected the union application based on this fact.”

Sanvictores said her union advocacy led to heightened scrutiny from management. “They knew I was a union leader and invited me to join the ERC (employee resource committee),” she said. “When I became more outspoken on the union effort, they made new rules limiting time on the ERC and asked me to leave the committee. They called me into office with HR and managers, and asked if I was spreading rumours, and told me I need to be loyal to the company.”

In March during the COVID-19 shutdown, Sanvictores was laid off. She said the company has hired back 70 percent of the workers, but she isn’t one of them. “I have not been recalled since the spring, I believe due to my leadership on the union efforts,” she said.

“Canada Goose cannot comment on the personal employment history or the circumstances around the termination or employment status of an individual employee,” the company told VICE World News.

During the course of their unionization efforts, workers had some successes. In 2019, they raised an unfair labor practice violation for intimidation and interference after a manager delivered an anti-union speech; the Manitoba Labour Board found that Canada Goose had violated the Labour Relations Act when the manager made critical and derogatory comments about the union days before the union vote. The company was sanctioned and forced to pay a $2,000 fine.

“In 2019, following an internal investigation, one employee was found to have made disparaging comments that do not align or represent the views of Canada Goose. While an isolated incident, this employee is no longer with the company,” said Canada Goose, adding, “It was conduct of this former employee that was the focus of the Manitoba Labour Board’s finding.”

Bain’s guidelines for responsible investment state that Bain will “remain committed to compliance with applicable national, state, and local laws in countries in which we invest; support the payment of competitive wages and benefits to employees, provide a safe and healthy workplace in the conformance with national and local law; and, consistent with applicable law, respect the rights of employees to decide whether or not to join a union and engage in collective bargaining.”

Sanvictores said that despite the hardships she’s experienced at Canada Goose and the obstacles that sit in the union’s way, the legal protections afforded to a union could be a way for immigrants to band together to effect real change. “Canada Goose wants to hold their boots on our necks, and especially new immigrants, (who) don’t have enough knowledge about their rights. If we have a union, we have a voice,” she said.

The state’s 105 part-time lawmakers will meet in the midst of a surging pandemic that has killed more than 1,500 Idahoans, and in the aftermath of rioting at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead.

Policies and proposals almost feel irrelevant. Perhaps this year’s overriding goal should be to reach adjournment with everyone’s health intact.

In any other year, that would sound hyberbolic. In 2021, it just sounds pragmatic.

Every session brings a cross-section of politically connected Idahoans to the “People’s House:” lawmakers, staffers, lobbyists, concerned citizens and journalists. Yes, the tension is often high — when foyers and meeting rooms are packed, when tempers grow short, when controversy is the currency of the day. Yet the atmosphere is usually cordial and collegial.

That’s what normal sessions feel like.

Since March, when the end of the 2020 legislative session collided squarely with the onset of coronavirus in Idaho, we all knew the 2021 session would not be normal. But the show will go on, even though Gov. Brad Little and legislative Democrats urged GOP leadership to consider a delay.

But as he lays out his policy agenda Monday, Little will also make a statement on pandemic protocol. He will deliver his State of the State address remotely, rather than speak to legislators and other elected officials from the House floor, a recipe for a superspreader event. He will speak from the Statehouse’s largest committee room, the 200-seat Lincoln Auditorium, which will be off limits to the public and the media.

The State of the State address is one bookend to a session. The votes in the House and Senate chambers, backloaded into the final days and hours of a session, provide the other bookend. In between, legislation takes shape behind the scenes, and Idahoans get their say on the proposals in committee hearings.

That process will be fundamentally different in 2021. And that, in turn, could fundamentally change the finished product.

Education groups plan to spend less time at the Statehouse this winter, with limited presence in committee rooms. In past years, the Idaho Education Association commonly brought teachers to the Statehouse to testify in hearings or talk one-on-one with legislators over lunch. Like other education stakeholders, union President Layne McInelly hopes remote testimony will fill some of the void.

“The IEA does not feel comfortable bringing in members to talk to their legislators,” McInelly said Thursday. “We can’t guarantee their safety.”

For education groups, the session provides a once-a-year audience with Idaho’s political leaders. But that too will feel different.

On the first morning of the session, Idaho Business for Education hosts an annual legislative academy. With the Lincoln Auditorium booked ahead for Little’s State of the State address, Monday’s event will go virtual, originating from a leased broadcast studio in West Boise.

Idaho’s Association for the Education of Young Children hosts an annual event designed, in part, to demystify pre-K. Legislators get to observe a preschool class held in the rotunda — and see that the kids are not stuck behind desks, learning instead through play. That event has been scrapped, and the AEYC is looking at a virtual event to show how it used a federal grant for a statewide early education needs assessment, Executive Director Beth Oppenheimer said.

Each February, trustees from across the state fill the Lincoln Auditorium during the Idaho School Boards Association’s “Day On The Hill” lobbying event. ISBA is planning a virtual version this year.

But it isn’t just the planned public events that will go by the boards. With education lobbyists planning to spend less time at the Statehouse, they’ll have to advocate by phone or text or email. Impromptu and often constructive conversations with a well-placed lawmaker are just not going to happen, making lobbying more complicated. “There’s a lot to be said about how productive one can be in a five-minute side meeting as opposed to a 30-minute Zoom meeting,” said Quinn Perry, the ISBA’s policy and government affairs director.

Lobbyists are also concerned about safety.

IBE Executive Director Rod Gramer notes that the state’s coronavirus case numbers have skyrocketed since August, when lawmakers held a contentious and largely unmasked special session. He thinks the 2021 session could be held safely, but only if everyone wears face masks and adheres to social distancing guidelines. “Not if it’s business as usual.”

It won’t be entirely business as usual. Committee rooms will be rearranged, with seating reduced to encourage social distancing. Idahoans will be able to watch all committee meetings over video stream, and this year, closed captioning will be available. But some things are unchanged; for example; House members will need to be on the floor to debate bills and cast votes, prompting Democrats Sue Chew of Boise and Muffy Davis of Ketchum to sue House Speaker Scott Bedke.

Compared to ISBA members — trustees making “gut-wrenching” decisions about face-to-face learning vs. online instruction — legislators just aren’t going nearly as far, Perry said.

A pandemic session poses problems for journalists.

Full disclosure: Idaho Education News will cover much of the 2021 session remotely, as we did at the end of the 2020 session. We will go to the Statehouse only when necessary, and use Idaho Public Television’s “Idaho In Session” streaming site to cover committee meetings and floor sessions. It means we will rely on cell phones and texts, sacrificing in-the-moment access to lawmakers and other key players. It’s not a good substitute. But we believe public health and staff safety must take precedence.

COVID-19 isn’t the only cloud over this session. In a recent letter posted to its website, the Idaho State Police urged Statehouse visitors to mask up and maintain social distancing — and follow rules of decorum, under threat of arrest.

That warning came before Wednesday’s insurrection on Capitol Hill — events bearing a frightening similarity to the Idaho Legislature’s special session in August, when crowds of protesters stormed the Statehouse, smashed a doorway window and took over the House rotunda. No one died during that special session, and Wednesday’s pro-President Trump rally at the Idaho Statehouse was peaceful, but some legislative regulars remain on edge.

“What we saw in August was just really terrifying for a lot of people,” Perry said Wednesday morning, shortly before the riots unfolded in the nation’s capital. “I think tensions are as high as they have ever been.”

The stakes at the Statehouse are high as well. The way lawmakers carve up a $600 million surplus could profoundly affect school funding and tax policy. Legislators will have to decide what to do about teacher pay, after Little froze pay raises in response to the pandemic. This is one year when education stakeholders say they dearly want member teachers and trustees talking to lawmakers, describing the challenges of an unprecedented school year.

Trouble is, 2021 will also be an unprecedented session.

Gramer has worked 20 Idaho legislative sessions — a dozen as a political reporter and columnist, dating back to the 1970s, and eight in his current advocacy role. He knows his job will be challenging this year, as phone calls and remote meetings replace the face-to-face approach to working the Statehouse.

“It’s sort of like this enclosed, isolated small city that’s created every year in Boise,” said Gramer, with more than a bit of nostalgia. “And that city is run on relationships.”

He’s right. The Statehouse is like its own city.

And this year, it’s a city imperiled.

Nia Jax has been accused of being an ‘unsafe worker’ on a number of occasions.

The WWE Superstar has an unwanted reputation for hurting opponents, with the likes of Charlotte Flair, Bayley, Becky Lynch, Zelina Vega and Ember Moon all suffering injuries at her hands.

Every time Jax enters the ring, she’s under the spotlight and this week’s RAW was no different.

‘The Irresistible Force’ picked up the win in a six women tag team match, which ended when she chokeslammed Dana Brooke before connecting with a leg drop.

But it was clear she botched the slam, driving Brooke into the canvas neck-first.

Thankfully, it’s since been confirmed by PWInsider that Dana is ‘100% OK’, but there’s no doubt she suffered a very nasty bump.

You can watch the incident, which has been shared on social media below:

Someone please check on Dana Brooke.



Her head bounced off that mat hard, pretty sure it was botched.



But what else is new when you’re working with Nia Jax? #WWERaw pic.twitter.com/wxRKZiYDYv — CONNER (@ConnerAJoseph) January 26, 2021

Unsurprisingly, fans were quick to criticise Jax for her latest botch.

“It’s unreal WWE still lets Nia Jax wrestle. Time after time she botches matches and hurts people,” one said.

“Send Nia Jax back to the Performance Centre. How many more times are you going to let her hurt more wrestlers?” another added.

A third simply wrote: “Typical Nia Jax.”

Interestingly, that chokeslam wasn’t the only botch during the match.

It actually ended long before Jax had the chance to chokeslam Brooke when Shayna Baszler was counted out at ringside.

WWE referees are told to count wrestlers out as a shoot – so that’s exactly what happened and the match ended – with RAW going to a commercial break.

The action then had to be restarted by Adam Pearce, who made his way down the ramp to make the announcement. It was all a bit of a mess.

Check out some footage of the first botch below:

With a £5bn investment in building safety, the Jenrick confirmed to the House of Commons that the government will fully fund the cost of replacing unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in residential buildings 18 metres (6-storeys) and over in England.

Five-point plan to bring an end to unsafe cladding

Government will pay for the removal of unsafe cladding for leaseholders in all residential buildings 18 metres (6 storeys) and over in England Generous finance scheme to provide reassurance for leaseholders in buildings between 11 and 18 metres (4 to 6 storeys), ensuring they never pay more than £50 a month for cladding removal An industry levy and tax to ensure developers play their part A world-class new safety regime to ensure a tragedy like Grenfell never happens again Providing confidence to this part of the housing market including lenders and surveyors.

Under the scheme, no leaseholder will ever pay more than £50 a month towards the removal of unsafe cladding. This will provide reassurance and security to leaseholders, and mortgage providers can be confident that where cladding removal is needed, properties will be worth lending against.

The government is working with industry to reduce the need for EWS1 forms, preventing leaseholders from facing delays and allowing hundreds of thousands of homes to be sold, bought, or re-mortgaged once again.

The housing secretary announced plans to introduce a ‘Gateway 2’ developer levy. The proposed levy will be targeted and apply when developers seek permission to develop certain high-rise buildings in England.

In addition, a new tax will be introduced for the UK residential property development sector. This will raise at least £2bn over a decade to help pay for cladding remediation costs.

The government will protect future generations from similar mistakes by bringing forward legislation this year to tighten the regulation of building safety and to review the construction products regime to prevent malpractice arising again.

‘Providing certainty to residents and lenders’

Housing secretary Robert Jenrick, said: “This is a comprehensive plan to remove unsafe cladding, support leaseholders, restore confidence to this part of the housing market and ensure this situation never arises again.

“Our unprecedented intervention means the hundreds of thousands of leaseholders who live in higher-rise buildings will now pay nothing towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding.

“Remedying the failures of building safety cannot just be a responsibility for taxpayers. That is why we will also be introducing a levy and tax on developers to contribute to righting the wrongs of the past.

“These measures will provide certainty to residents and lenders, boosting the housing market, reinstating the value of properties and getting buying and selling homes back on track. We are working with lenders and surveyors to make this happen.

“Our landmark intervention will make homes safer and free those who did the right thing – saving for years to get on the property ladder – to enjoy the homes in which they have invested so much.”

The government will work closely with industry to design an appropriate scheme.

Further details on the scheme, including eligibility and the claims process, will be provided in the coming weeks.

Funding ‘unlikely to meet the cost of remediating all buildings’

Katherine Metcalfe, legal director at Pinsent Masons, said: “The government has been under considerable pressure to alleviate the burden on homeowners but the £3.5bn of funding announced today is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the cost of remediating all buildings with unsafe cladding.

“The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has estimated the cost to be almost £15bn. The devil will be in the detail.

“The current Building Safety Fund application process is complex, costly and time consuming and presents real hurdles for building owners who urgently want to improve safety for residents.

“A new tax on developers may discourage investment in new schemes, and result in higher rents or prices for homes within them.

“Clarification on when and where EWS1 forms are needed will be extremely welcome by homeowners, developers and lenders alike.”"

The country’s cladding crisis, following the Grenfell fire disaster in 2017, has left some homeowners bankrupt and many people facing huge bills for fire-safety improvements.

So, what exactly is cladding, what did the government announce - and what happened during the Grenfell Tower tragedy?

Here is everything you need to know.

What is cladding?

Cladding is the application of materials around the external surface of a building.

It is used to provide thermal insulation, weather resistance, to improve the appearance of buildings and for energy efficiency.

Materials are applied one over another to form a skin or layer.

Cladding was fitted to Grenfell Tower in Kensington, West London, when it was refurbished at a cost of £9million in May 2017.

This was in the form of dense foam boards coated in zinc rainproof sheets which covered the outside of the 23-storey building.

When the fire started, the flames spread easily via the combustible cladding.

Cladding on similar tower blocks was subsequently ripped down following the disaster - but there is still a cladding crisis in the UK.

What is the cladding crisis?

More than three and a half years since the Grenfell fire, thousands of flat owners across the country are looking at large bills to improve fire-safety in their buildings.

An estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise tower blocks which are wrapped in flammable cladding.

After the disaster, which killed 72 people, regulations on cladding changed which meant that people attempting to sell or re-mortgage their homes were unable to do so as they could not provide the correct documentation to prove the cladding on their building met fire safety standards.

Leaseholders have also faced other unexpected costs in the wake of the tragedy.

Fire patrols were put in place in hundreds of buildings. These patrols, known as “waking watches”, cost groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds per month.

Leaseholders have had to cover the costs of fixing safety faults, and residents have faced a surge in insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems.

Data released by the government in January showed that cladding removal and repair work had only been carried out on 58 per cent of social housing blocks and 30 per cent of private sector buildings.

The crisis has been affecting first-time buyers who were not aware that their buildings were wrapped in flammable cladding or had other fire safety faults.

In 2020, the UK Government announced a £1.5billion Building Safety Fund to help with the crisis.

What does the extra government funding cover?

Pressure was growing on the government to increase the funding for residents who are living in flammable buildings before the new sum was announced by ministers on Wednesday 10 February.

Robert Jenrick called the extra money the “largest ever government investment” in building safety.

The £3.5billion comes on top of the £1.5billion announced last year.

Leaseholders in high-rise buildings above 18m, or with six storeys or more, would face no cost for the cladding removal, Mr Jenrick said.

A long-term scheme has also been announced for cladding that needs to be removed in low-rise flat blocks.

As part of the scheme, leaseholders would not pay more than £50 a month for the removal of unsafe cladding, the housing secretary said.

A committee of MPs has estimated that the total cost of the cladding crisis could total £15billion.

What happened at Grenfell Tower?

The fire which tore through Grenfell Tower in June 2017 is remembered as one of the UK's worst modern tragedies.

Just before 1am on 14 June, a fire broke out in a Hotpoint fridge freezer in a kitchen on the fourth floor of the 23-storey building.

In a matter of minutes, the flames had reached the exterior of the building and quickly spread to all four sides.

By 3am, most of the tower’s top floors were on fire.

Seventy-two people died in the disaster.

Experts have said the composite foam sandwich panels helped the fire to spread from the lower floors to the top of the block.

An investigation by The Guardian claimed that the material used in the tower’s cladding was the cheaper, more flammable version of two available options."

President Joe Biden argues workers should not have to make that choice.

An executive order signed on his second full day in office could make it easier for people to still qualify for jobless benefits if they quit or refuse a job that puts them at undue risk of infection from the coronavirus.

More than 18 million Americans are drawing some form of government unemployment assistance.

The order asks the U.S. Department of Labor to clarify that workers who refuse jobs due to unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance. A department spokesman told Reuters the agency is developing an Unemployment Insurance Program Letter - the usual mechanism for issuing guidelines or clarifying policies - in response to the order.

The Labor Department also issued new guidance on Friday with recommendations on how employers can protect workers from the virus, which has infected more than 25 million Americans and led to more than 433,500 U.S. deaths since the pandemic began.

“In a period where lots of people have lost jobs and people are desperate for work, people will go and end up working under dangerous conditions and they will do so believing they have no other alternative,” said Ken Jacobs, chair of the UC Berkeley Labor Center.

Assuring them they have the right to refuse unsafe work, and paying them enough to afford not to work, is “vitally important,” Jacobs said. “You want people in the greatest risk groups to stay home.”

SEEKING CLARITY

It’s not clear how many workers have lost unemployment benefits after refusing jobs because of COVID-19 safety concerns, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation and an expert on unemployment insurance. Still, the new guidance should establish minimum protections for workers, replacing an approach that can vary by state, he said.

“It’s been very unclear for a claimant to understand whether they can refuse an offer to go back to work,” Stettner said.

Currently some states, including Texas, publish lists of the circumstances in which a worker might be able to keep receiving benefits after turning down a job. For instance, the state offers exceptions for workers age 65 and up, or those with health conditions that put them at high risk.

But other states advise workers of a narrower set of protections, and many make decisions on a case by case basis.

“The goal would be to have some clear standards,” Stettner said.

The new federal guidance, likely to be issued in the coming weeks, would be aimed at making both states and workers aware they should be able to qualify for unemployment benefits after refusing a job that puts them at greater risk because of their age, a health condition or lack of COVID-19 safety protocols, analysts say.

‘WE NEED A STANDARD’

That policy could make a big difference for people in jobs at restaurants or other businesses requiring workers to be in close proximity to others, two recent studies suggest.

Essential workers were 55% more likely to get infected with coronavirus than those who stayed at home, according to a study of the early months of the pandemic in Pennsylvania published this week by researchers at Independence Blue Cross and the Wharton School of Business.

“We all had a hunch that essential workers by the nature of their jobs are probably more exposed, which means they’re probably more likely to get infected – but what we didn’t know was by how much,” said Wharton’s Hummy Song, one of the paper’s authors.

A separate study out last week from the University of California found deaths of working-age Californians increased by 22% in 2020 from what would have been expected based on prior trends, and the deaths were concentrated in certain occupations.

Deaths among workers in food and agriculture, for instance, were 39% higher. Among healthcare workers, deaths were up 20%, the study noted.

The findings indicate there may be better protections in place in health care settings than in restaurants or other fields, said Yea-Hung Chen, one of the study’s authors.

New guidance from the Biden administration could help workers in at least some of those higher-risk sectors keep unemployment benefits and avoid unsafe work - even as it puts pressure on companies to make workplaces safer, said University of California, Berkeley professor Jesse Rothstein.

“We need a standard,” said Rothstein. “The DOL has been AWOL for the last year.”"

A lead contamination scare has shocked the area and resulted in a do not drink notice with emergency water tankers now supplying residents.

Dunedin City Council says it may be months before the notice is lifted for the residents of Waikouaiti, Karitane and Hawksbury Village.

It was revealed on 2 February unsafe levels of lead had been intermittently detected in the water supply going back to July.

The highest reading was almost 40 times the acceptable limit.

Public Health South has offered blood tests to the area's more than 1500 residents in the days since.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Susan Jack confirmed last night there had been some above the safe blood level - including children.

""As expected some people have come back with levels that are higher than the cut off of 0.24 micromoles per litre. It's not very common when we look at the whole population that was tested,"" Dr Jack told RNZ.

However, she would not be drawn on how many people had recorded high levels.

Further investigation was needed, particularly in the cases of children, she said.

""The first test usually on the children it was a finger prick or heel prick - it's a screening test. Then we need to confirm that using a venous sample.""

All those showing concerning blood lead levels were contacted.

""We're going through understanding what possible risk factors and exposures they might've had and then, especially for the children, we're offering a visit out to their home to look at where there are other environmental risks. So is there lead paint, is there renovation, are they involved in hobbies, do their parents work in a place that might have exposure to lead,"" Dr Jack said.

""There are many causes of elevated lead and we need to determine is water part of that or can it all be attributable to other causes?""

A father of three who spoke at the meeting said he had concerns for his youngest child after the two-year-old experienced health problems last year as she suffered a loss of appetite and weight, as well as greying of the skin.

After testing the girl for everything from cancer to coeliac disease, the revelation of lead in the drinking water came as a shock, the man, who did not want to be identified, said.

""We're not sure that it [lead poisoning] is the cause but it's just another question to ask a doctor and pediatrician,"" he told RNZ.

The family had been tested and all came back below the safe level, he said.

""After today I do feel a bit better. I've still got health concerns and questions that haven't been answered on that, but hopefully they'll be answered soon.""

Waikouaiti resident Paul Bartlett said a friend of his was among those showing high blood lead levels.

""The ones that I've been talking to tonight are older people and one of them has got a real high reading so it could be quite concerning.""

Following the higher readings being detected, he planned to go and get a test himself now.

Locals still do not know when the no-drink notice would be lifted.

DCC three waters manager Tom Dyer told the meeting it was more likely to be months than weeks.

Work to replace almost 5km of old pipes in Waikouaiti would begin soon, but it was unknown when it would be finished, he said.

Dr Jack said there would be another public meeting in about a fortnight.

Further details of what the blood tests had revealed would be shared then, she said."

Opinion contributor

We assume that anything with “baby” on the label must be safe, gentle and wholesome. Surely companies making baby foods would not knowingly sell products with dangerous levels of toxins, right? The Food and Drug Administration must be checking?

Unfortunately, those assumptions are wrong.

Over the last year, I have been investigating baby food safety by looking at the test results possessed by the manufacturers themselves. What I learned was alarming.

Common baby foods found in grocery stores — made by trusted brands such as HappyBABY (Nurture, Inc.), Earth’s Best Organic (Hain Celestial Group, Inc.), Beech-Nut, and Gerber — contain dangerously high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury.

Heavy metals in baby food

Toxic heavy metals are exceptionally harmful to babies’ brains. Exposure can lead to long-term brain damage, causing decreased academic achievement, lost IQ points, learning disabilities, and behavioral disabilities. Babies’ developing brains are at a much higher risk than adults, since babies are small, have other developing organ systems, and absorb more of the heavy metals than adults. The heavy metals accumulate in the body, which means that the more a baby eats tainted baby food, the worse the negative impact on their brain development.

USA TODAY Food:Arsenic, toxic metals found in baby food including Walmart, Gerber, Beech-Nut brands, according to new report

Right now, there are very few federal standards limiting the amount of heavy metals in baby food, and there is no requirement for the companies to tell us how much their products contain. But we do know that many baby foods contain much higher levels of heavy metals than products for which federal standards exist. Bottled water, for instance, may contain no more than 10 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic. In just one disturbing example that I found, apple and broccoli puffs were sold with a lead content of 180 parts per billion. Remember, the company’s own testing proved it.

In the absence of rules, baby food makers have made up their own proprietary standards. But the companies set them dangerously high, often at or above 100 parts per billion of the dangerous metals. And even then, my investigation found that the companies ignore them. If their product contains higher levels of toxic heavy metals than their proprietary standards allow, they sell them anyway. The manufacturer of HappyBABY explained to me that their testing is only intended to monitor their suppliers, not to protect babies. So, “all of the products that were tested were sold into commerce.”

Touting sex work to teenagers:Hey, Teen Vogue. On career day, no young girl should say 'I want to be a prostitute.'

Parents who seek out organic options for their babies will also be disappointed to learn that organic baby foods are just as dangerous as conventional foods in terms of heavy metal content in their foods.

What else is there to hide?

As concerning as all of this is, there are three companies that could be even worse. Walmart (seller of Parent’s Choice), Sprout Organic Foods, and Campbell (seller of Plum Organics) refused to provide their testing results as part of our congressional investigation. Our investigative body is greatly concerned that their lack of cooperation might obscure the presence of even higher levels of heavy metals in their baby foods, compared to their competitors’ products. Parents beware.

As chairman of the House Oversight Economic and Consumer Policy Subcommittee, I have investigated my share of bad acts by corporations. I find none more disconcerting than companies that make profits by putting our children’s health at risk.

I uncovered that e-cigarette maker, JUUL, was targeting kids as young as eight years old by sponsoring their summer camps. I discovered that the manufacturers of booster seats were falsely advertising their products for children too small to safely use them, putting them at risk of serious injury. However, the bad behavior of baby food manufacturers may take the cake.

Parents confront many unavoidable worries, but the safety of the baby food they give their children should not be one of them. I hope that HappyBABY, Earth’s Best Organic, Beech-Nut, Gerber, Walmart (seller of Parent’s Choice), Sprout Organic Foods and Campbell (seller of Plum Organics) take this opportunity to make their products safer. Just in case they dither, I will introduce legislation that will require them to make their products safe.

Court orders notices to Centre, AstraZeneca over Covishield adverse effects

The Madras High Court on Friday ordered notices, returnable by March 26, to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) and Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on a writ petition to declare the Covishield vaccine unsafe since it had reportedly led to adverse effects on the litigant, who had volunteered for clinical trials.

Justice Abdul Quddhose ordered issuance of notices to the CEOs of Serum Institute of India Private Limited, AstraZeneca UK and also the chairman of the ethics committee of Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, a deemed to be university in Chennai, on the petition filed by Asif Riaz, a business consultant, who also sought ₹5 crore in compensation.

The petitioner’s counsel N.G.R. Prasad told the court that the 41-year-old litigant was a Master’s degree holder in management from Massey University in New Zealand and a father of two children aged 12 and seven.

The vaccine, against COVID-19, was put through clinical trials as mandated under the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules of 2019 after obtaining permission for human trial from DGCI. The trials were conducted in four phases. First phase was to estimate safety and tolerability of the initial administration of an investigational new drug on humans and second was to evaluate effectiveness of the drug.

Common short term side effects and risks associated with the drug were also studied in the second phase and the primary objective of the third phase was demonstration or confirmation of therapeutic benefits and to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated in the second phase. The fourth phase or the post marketing trial of new drugs were performed after the approval of the drug.

The petitioner volunteered to participate in the Phase III trials since he wanted to help in the larger effort to find a solution to the dismal situation that prevailed across the globe due to the pandemic. The trial was conducted at Sri Ramachandra Institute and an information sheet given to him stated that the vaccine was previously tested in the UK and it was found to be safe, he said.

The participant information sheet listed out the possible reactions such as fever, chills and fatigue that might occur after vaccination but they “not even remotely close to what I experienced,” Mr. Riaz said in his affidavit and added that he underwent severe adverse reactions about 10 days after he was administered the vaccine on October 1, 2020.

He was immediately rushed to the hospital and admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. After undergoing a harrowing experience of losing consciousness due to neurological setbacks, he got discharged at his request on October 26, the petitioner said and claimed that even after three months, he often experiences trembling of hands, fear, anxiety, trepidation, panic and mood swings.

“I have lost all the projects I was working on that entitled an annual earning of over $30,000 a year prior to volunteering for the vaccine. I am feeling utterly frustrated and totally lacking in confidence. I am also feeling very guilty that my two small children who get very scared when I have extreme mood swings because of my decision to volunteer for the test vaccine,” he added."

If the ship is asked to quarantine at the port of call, then the charterers’ port of choice could be unsafe.
ConclusionRecent developments including Covid-19 and cyber attacks revive the old doctrine of safe port and the charterers’ obligation to nominate a safe port.","charterers, owners, safe, obligation, guidance, abnormal, ship, safety, play, unsafe, danger, ports, port",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Many standard form charterparties often contain an express warranty to ensure the port’s safety on the part of the charterer. Even in circumstances where such a warranty is not expressly provided, there is still the possibility that one could be implied.

In this article, we first examine what constitutes a safe port and the nature of the charterers’ obligation to nominate one and then how this old doctrine finds new use in the era of Covid-19 and increased digitalisation.

The Charterers’ obligation to nominate a safe port

The charterers’ primary obligation is an “absolute” one. It is a question of whether the port is safe not whether the charterers were careless in their selection of a port. Examples of such absolute obligations can be found in the NYPE 1946 and Asbatankvoy 1977 standards forms.

Some charter forms, however, expressly qualify the obligation to nominate a safe port to one of due diligence. In these instances, the charterers’ obligation is merely to take reasonable care to establish that the nominated port is safe. Examples of such a reduced obligation can be found in the Shelltime 3 and Shellvoy 6 standards forms. Parties should note that a due diligence clause may be overridden by unqualified safe port language in the recap, as in The Greek Fighter [2006].

The US Supreme Court recently brought US law in line with UK law through its significant ruling in The Athos I.[1] In this case, the court held that the safe berth provision in an Asbatankvoy form constituted a warranty of safety, imposing an absolute duty on the charterer to select a safe berth.

Furthermore, the US Court of Appeals (Third Circuit) held that the head owner could benefit from the absolute warranty wording of the voyage charterparty down the line as a third party beneficiary. It is doubtful whether an English Court would have taken the same view in this respect.

When does this obligation arise?

The charterers’ obligation arises at the time they give the order for the vessel to proceed to a specific port. At that time, the port only needs to be prospectively safe for the ship to reach, use and leave at the appropriate time in the future.

The charterers’ order does not have to be incontestably obeyed. The master and owners are permitted a reasonable amount of time to collect local advice and eventually decide whether to proceed to the port or not.

It should always be borne in mind that, if owners knew about the port’s unsafety but, nonetheless, obeyed the charterers’ order, they might potentially be found to have waived their right to claim damages for any losses suffered to the extent that they made unequivocal representations. Reserving one’s rights is always sensible when parties are not aware of the risks and how dangerous or not the situation may become.

Nevertheless, if a state of unsafety arises after the order has been given and when the ship can still avoid the danger, the charterers come under a new obligation to give alternative instructions.[2]

Definition of safe port

The long-standing definition of what constitutes a safe port was established in The Eastern City [1958] to be the following:

“A port will not be safe unless, in the relevant period of time, the particular ship can reach it, use it, and return from it without, in the absence of some abnormal occurrence, being exposed to danger which cannot be avoided by good navigation and seamanship…”.

As such, the question of safety concerns the specific vessel’s approach voyage, use of port and departure from it. All three requirements need to be satisfied for a port to be safe.

Additionally, the dangers that may render a port unsafe can be physical or non-physical. Physical dangers may arise as a matter of topography or man-made hazards such as ice, sandbanks, misplaced fenders, wrecks and even meteorological risks.

Much will depend on whether the port had the proper systems in place to ensure safety such as local warnings, navigational aids (pilots, buoys, lights) and any technological systems to monitor and report the safety of channels leading to and from it[3].

In The Marinicki, the vessel was damaged by an obstruction in a dredged approach channel. Despite the fact that the owners failed to show that the obstruction was there when the relevant voyage order was given, their claim succeeded on the basis that the port lacked a proper system for monitoring the safety of the channel and reporting hazards accordingly.

Non-physical dangers may be in the form of political unsafety such as war and hostilities. Furthermore, in The Greek Fighter [2006], Colman J accepted, albeit in obiter, that a port could be unsafe if there was a risk of unjustified confiscation of the ship by the local coastguard and the political and legal system provided no effective remedy in respect of such an unlawful seizure.

Defences to an unsafe port claim

In accordance with the well-established definition of a safe port, the charterers will not have breached their obligation if the danger is caused by an “abnormal occurrence”. As demonstrated by The Evia (No. 2) [1982], occurrences are abnormal where the danger does not arise from the qualities of the port itself.

In The Ocean Victory [2017], the Supreme Court held that one must look at the frequency of such a danger occurring and the likelihood of it occurring again and further stressed that it was an “abnormal occurrence” for two normal characteristics of the port to happen in combination.

In addition to abnormal occurrences, dangers that are avoidable by good navigation and seamanship do not render a port unsafe either. The standard of navigation expected is that of an ordinarily prudent and skilful master. It follows that, where the master and crew fail to reach this standard and are negligent on their part, charterers may rely on such failure to show that it was the effective cause of the damage. This may prove a difficult case to run if the master has acted reasonably but mistakenly.

Covid-19 and safe ports

There is currently no case law on the issue of whether a pandemic could render a port unsafe. However, two types of danger can potentially lead to an unsafe port in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Firstly, a port could be unsafe if there is a risk to the ship crew of infection. To safeguard against this possibility, the IMO has provided guidance to the ports on what measures to take through its IMO Circular No.4204. If a port fails to adhere to this framework, it could potentially be rendered unsafe.

The second danger concerns the risks of the ship’s detention or its blacklisting. If the ship is asked to quarantine at the port of call, then the charterers’ port of choice could be unsafe. However, the detention or quarantine period would have to last for an inordinate time for the port to become unsafe. As long as the quarantine imposed is for 14 days, owners will face difficulties in asserting that a port was unsafe.

Nonetheless, there is a stronger argument for the port’s unsafety if the vessel is blacklisted at a subsequent port, merely because of it having called at a previous port severely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.

The charterers’ defence against such an unsafe port claim could potentially be that the Covid-19 outbreak is an abnormal occurrence. Following this, any danger to the ship due to Covid-19 would not automatically render the port unsafe. However, charterers should beware that, as the time goes by, the argument for “abnormal occurrence” becomes weaker.

Cyber attacks and safe ports

The increased digitalisation of port ecosystems has led to the emergence of new threats and cybersecurity challenges. The concept of ‘Smart Ports’ and the deployment of Internet of Things devices, Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation and blockchain mean that ports will have to integrate cybersecurity in their global strategy and look beyond physical safety.

It is arguable that a port could be rendered unsafe if it has not taken any active measures to guard against cyber attacks. While a single cyber event would probably not suffice, if a port suffers repeated cyber attacks or if it can be shown that the port has not taken measures to protect against cyber attacks, then the port could be rendered unsafe as per The Ocean Victory [2015].

Conclusion

Recent developments including Covid-19 and cyber attacks revive the old doctrine of safe port and the charterers’ obligation to nominate a safe port. Safe port is a question of law but safety is a question of fact.

For this reason, it is recommended to consult experts at an early stage. Members of our Greek office can advise on all aspects of charterparty disputes and would be happy to assist with any queries and matters arising."

Crystal Clifton hopes it will help her finally get some answers about her unemployment claim after eight months without a payment.","work, states, guidance, refuse, safety, state, unsafe, clifton, workers, virginia, refusing, unemployment, benefits",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"In his first weeks on the job, President Joe Biden has taken a number of actions to improve safety for workers during the pandemic by ordering the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to strengthen workplace safety rules, and by making sure workers know they have the right to refuse work that isn’t safe.

Biden directed the Labor Department to issue clear guidance to states that those who decline work due to safety concerns should qualify for unemployment benefits. Until now such decisions have been left to states, leading to wide variation and confusion.

Crystal Clifton had been working at a restaurant in a small town in rural Virginia on and off for the past decade or so, but when the pandemic hit, the work suddenly became risky.

“I was afraid to have that close contact,” she said. “There wouldn’t have been a way to put yourself 6 feet apart, and with my circumstances, if I get [COVID-19], I might be one that didn’t make it.”

Clifton has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure and a heart condition that put her at increased risk from COVID-19. Masks weren’t mandated in Virginia until December.

In May, her boss asked her to return to work after the initial lockdown ended, but Clifton said she expressed concern about the safety of returning.

Clifton’s employer notified the state that she had voluntarily quit, which stripped her of the unemployment benefits she had been getting since March.

She and her boyfriend are now getting by on his disability check and food stamps. She said she’s been unable to pay for medical expenses, her car loan or utility bills, and she worries her heat will soon be turned off.

“We’re, like, 27 degrees right now and it’s snowing,” she said. “It’s a lot of hardship. You know, it’s hard to make it without money.”

Clifton has been getting help with her unemployment claim from attorney Pat Levy-Lavelle at the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia. He believes Clifton should qualify for benefits, but her contention that she refused work for safety reasons hasn’t been evaluated yet.

“In Virginia, when somebody refuses work, the state agency looks on a case-by-case basis as to why the job refusal happened,” he said. “And, as with many states, it’s months and months behind on case processing.”

The lack of clear federal guidance on this issue has led to a patchwork of different standards from state to state and case to case that has left workers not knowing where they stand, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

“People were really put in a ‘it’s your money or your life’ situation,” he said. “They could refuse to go back to work, but they had no guidance about it.”

He said there’s been a spike in unemployment claims being denied because the applicant was deemed to have quit or refused work. But the numbers are all over the map.

Century Foundation analysis of federal reports found Nebraska, for instance, denied about 30 times more of these unemployment cases than California between April and December even though its population is about 20 times smaller.

New federal guidance won’t completely erase those differences, but it could send a powerful signal to workers who otherwise wouldn’t know their rights.

“People will trust the president,” said Mazahir Salih, who directs the Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa, which assists low-wage essential workers. “If the president says the sun comes up tomorrow, they will say ‘yeah.'”

She said Biden’s message about workplace safety could give more workers confidence to speak out.

To qualify for unemployment, workers will need to offer some proof of safety concerns, and it’s still not clear whether the Labor Department guidance will cover workers who quit a job for safety reasons or just those who are already unemployed and refuse work.

Crystal Clifton hopes it will help her finally get some answers about her unemployment claim after eight months without a payment.

“Even though you don’t sleep a lot because everything’s on your mind, it’s like a nightmare you can’t wake up from,” she said."

​On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) clarified in guidance that laid-off individuals who refuse work because of COVID-19 safety concerns may be eligible for unemployment benefits.



""For many of America's workers, choosing between unsafe employment and refusing work to avoid the risk of coronavirus infection has serious consequences,"" the DOL stated. ""Too often, those who do not return to work or accept a job offer over concerns about workplace exposure lose their state unemployment benefits.""

In response to a directive from President Biden, the DOL issued guidance to state unemployment insurance agencies that expands the number of instances in which workers may be eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA).

The guidance uses the example of an individual who was laid off in June 2020 and began receiving regular unemployment compensation. The individual was recalled to work in October 2020. However, because the worksite was not in compliance with the local mask mandate, the individual refused to return to work and, as a result, was disqualified from continued receipt of regular unemployment compensation under state law. The individual is now eligible to apply for PUA under this new COVID-19-related reason.

In another example, an individual was laid off in October 2020 and began receiving regular unemployment compensation. The individual received a new job offer in January 2021. However, the new worksite was unsafe due to noncompliance with physical distancing measures under state law. The individual, after declining the offer, was disqualified from continued receipt of regular unemployment compensation under state law. The individual is now eligible to apply for PUA under this new COVID-19 related reason.

An individual is not eligible for PUA if he or she is otherwise eligible for regular unemployment compensation. Many states have provisions in their state unemployment compensation law that consider work that unreasonably exposes an individual to health and safety risks to be unsuitable work, the DOL stated.



We've gathered articles on the guidance from SHRM Online and other trusted media outlets.

Guidance's Application

The DOL guidance broadens the PUA program designed for workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits. The guidelines do not apply to workers who quit because of COVID-19 concerns. The guidance notes, ""This new COVID-19-related reason applies only to individuals who had already been receiving unemployment benefits but were determined to be ineligible or disqualified under state law because they refused an offer of work at a worksite that was not in compliance with local, state or national health and safety standards directly related to COVID-19."" The DOL added that there is a separate item in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act providing eligibility to an individual who quits his or her job as a direct result of COVID-19.

(Forbes) and (DOL guidance)

Three Categories of Workers

The new guidance expands unemployment benefits eligibility to three categories of workers:

Workers receiving unemployment benefits who had their continued regular unemployment claims denied after they refused to work or accept an offer of work at a worksite not in compliance with coronavirus health and safety standards.

Workers who have been laid off or who have had their work hours reduced as a direct result of the pandemic.

School employees working without a contract or reasonable assurance of continued employment who face reduced paychecks and no assurance of continued pay when schools are closed due to the coronavirus.

The new reasons apply retroactively—as if they had been included from the beginning of the PUA program.

Tens of Thousands Affected

The guidance is partly aimed at the approximately 37,000 people who were denied unemployment insurance after being laid off and declining to return to work last year. But it will have little effect on the 1.23 million people who have been denied unemployment insurance after quitting. The change in eligibility takes effect immediately. Nonetheless, workers' claims could take at least a month to be approved, given delays at state unemployment agencies.

(The Washington Post)

PUA Benefits

Congress created the PUA benefits program in March of last year to provide payments to certain people affected by COVID-19, as well as freelancers, independent contractors, gig workers and others who don't typically qualify for unemployment insurance. The program already is available to those who can't work because they have a health condition that puts them at risk or because their children's schools have closed.

(CNN)

State Function

Unemployment insurance is primarily a state function, and each state can set its own rules and procedures, noted Rob Duston, an attorney with Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr in Washington, D.C. ""It does not appear that the DOL has any authority to require states to change the terms of their eligibility for unemployment insurance,"" he said.

In addition to supplying 20,000 direct jobs, including 8,500 unionized workers, the market generates $5 billion in revenue annually.
“People need to be respected and treated well,” said Leo Servedio, vice president of Teamsters Local 202.
The Hunts Point strike was part of a series of actions across the country by unionized food-distribution workers for higher pay and better workplace protections, both in general and specific to the pandemic.
Standing outside the gates of Hunts Point market after he announced the victory, Kane emphasized the importance of the strike, and of solidarity, for essential workers.","pandemic, wages, point, largest, market, hunts, teamsters, unsafe, striking, low, fooddistribution, exposes, strike, centers, unfi, workers, local, conditions",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"On January 23, after a tense, week-long strike led by Teamsters Local 202, 1,400 employees of New York City’s massive Hunts Point Terminal Produce Market reached an agreement with management that includes the biggest raise ever won by Local 202’s bargaining unit. The victory was the latest in a series of actions by the Teamsters, as the pandemic has ignited long-simmering labor disputes at food-distribution centers across the country.

“I think the pandemic has raised the concerns of workers,” said Daniel Kane Jr., president of Local 202, in an interview with Ag Insider. “Workers in general, have been losing ground in America but I think the pandemic has brung many of these issues to light. Workers are now saying that if we don’t fight now, when will we?”

Hunts Point market, the world’s largest wholesale produce market, is located in the south Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the country. Even before the pandemic, the neighborhood had one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country. And from March through September last year, SNAP enrollment in the Bronx rose by 65,000, the second-highest rise in the city, and the number of people getting cash assistance rose by 21,000, the largest jump in the city.

On any given day the sprawling market complex serves 22 million people and is the main artery in the region’s food-distribution network. In addition to supplying 20,000 direct jobs, including 8,500 unionized workers, the market generates $5 billion in revenue annually.

The vast majority of the workforce is made up of people of color and immigrants who earn, on average, $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Deemed essential, they have continued to work throughout the pandemic, even as the Bronx emerged as the city’s virus epicenter; six market workers have died of COVID-19 so far, and hundreds more have been infected.

Bruno Pena, a porter who has worked at the market for 32 years, says he contracted COVID-19 last spring and was forced to quarantine for two weeks. Although he was grateful that his case was mild, he says the virus is just another threat in a job that is inherently dangerous. In July, while climbing a ladder, he lost his footing and fell, injuring his arm and shoulder. “The job is kind of dangerous because we have to use the machines [forklifts], and many people get hurt,” he said. “Sometimes my arm still hurts, but I got to continue to work because I got to pay the rent.”

The Hunts Point strike was the first at the market in 35 years. Management initially balked at the union’s request for a $1 increase in the hourly wage. But with staff shortages threatening to strangle the region’s food supply, management eventually acquiesced. Under the new contract, workers will get a minimum raise of 70¢ per hour in the first year, rising to a $1.85 increase over three years.

“People need to be respected and treated well,” said Leo Servedio, vice president of Teamsters Local 202.

The Hunts Point strike was part of a series of actions across the country by unionized food-distribution workers for higher pay and better workplace protections, both in general and specific to the pandemic. Led by the Teamsters, the push echoes the more spontaneous protests and general outcry that has arisen from other food-industry workers and their advocates — from meatpacking plants and farm fields to restaurants and food-delivery services — after the virus made it impossible to continue to ignore the neglect and abuse these “essential” workers had long endured.

Last July, 160 members of Teamsters Local Union 414 went on a week-long strike at the United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) distribution center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after going without a contract since 2019. UNFI is the largest public grocery distributor in the country, servicing chains such as Whole Foods and Stop & Shop. The Teamsters reached an agreement with UNFI in August for a new four-year contract. That same month, workers with Teamsters Local 104 in Tucson, Arizona, threatened to strike against US Foods, the nation’s second-largest commercial food distributor, claiming it had failed to adhere to the CDC’s COVID-19 safety guidelines.

Then in November, about 100 truck drivers working for UNFI in New York’s Hudson Valley voted to strike, saying the company had refused to provide basic protective equipment including masks and hand sanitizer and also hadn’t disinfected their trucks in months. Also in November, some 70 drivers and warehouse workers struck against Cash-Wa Distributing, a food distributor in Fargo, North Dakota, saying that the company wasn’t doing enough to protect them from the virus.

The pandemic has created leverage for labor unions in other sectors, too. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, unions representing nurses and other healthcare workers “have seized on the pandemic fallout to organize new chapters and pursue contract talks for better conditions and benefits.”

“We wouldn’t be alive today if we didn’t have the union,” said Elizabeth Lalasz, a Chicago public hospital nurse and steward for National Nurses United, the country’s largest union of registered nurses, told the Times.

Standing outside the gates of Hunts Point market after he announced the victory, Kane emphasized the importance of the strike, and of solidarity, for essential workers. “We appreciate people applauding and thanking essential workers, but we had to keep our families fed as we fed the city,” he said. “You have to work together, fight together, dance together, and smile together. That’s what we did.”

The report, which interviewed Indigenous people from the C-suite all the way down to non-management roles, found a majority experience an “emotional tax” — a feeling of being different from peers at work because of gender, race or ethnicity — which can affect a person’s well-being and ability to thrive. “Indigenous people in Canada, especially women, continue to face some of the workplace’s most entrenched hurdles, including bias and discrimination that impact their health, well-being and ability to progress,” said Vandana Juneja, Catalyst Canada’s executive director, in a statement, adding Indigenous employees who don’t feel psychologically safe are less likely to report a sense of belonging or being valued for their uniqueness, speak up when something isn’t right and be able to share their creativity at work.

Now, the government says a ban on the use of unregulated homes for under-16s will come into force in September.

It comes after a year-long consultation into the housing of children in the care system.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Vulnerable children under 16 are too young for the type of accommodation that provides a place to stay but not the care and support that they need. The action taken today, supported by the sector and in response to their views, is an important step in making sure children in care are placed in settings that give them the highest chances of success.""

But the move has already angered many campaigners who had hoped the government would extend the ban to those up to 18 years of age.

Sam Turner, policy manager at Become, a charity for children in care and young care leavers, said: ""Parents of 16 and 17 year olds don't suddenly change the style of parenting when they reach that age. They don't move them to somewhere else at the age of 16.

""But that's exactly what the government is suggesting should be the norm.

""The reality under the government's proposals is that those who are 16 and over can expect to receive a lower level of support than others. And we don't think that's right at all.""

In response, the government says it will introduce national standards for unregulated settings that are accommodating 16 and 17-year-old children in care, and care leavers.

Ashleigh was 15 when her foster placement broke down and social services had to find her a placement. At first, she was taken to a hotel for the night where she had to share a room with two support workers.

A day later, she was sent to live in the home of someone she had never met before, and was taken to a caravan park a few weeks later.

""When I was in the caravan, I felt pure fear. It was my third move in just over a month. My GCSEs had finished and I knew that I hadn't achieved well because of everything that was going on.""

Ashleigh told Sky News that while she was staying in the caravan, the people who lived next door gave her home-brewed alcohol and that her support workers allowed it to happen, even though she was underage.

""I drank it. The support staff did as well. I went round to the next door caravan on my own.

""After a few drinks I got lightheaded. I felt like I was going to pass out. I heard them lock the door from the inside. I knew something wasn't right. I panicked. I managed to get out and ran. They started chasing me. I've never felt in so much danger as I did in that moment.""

The next day, Ashleigh says she told her social worker what happened.

""She told me there was nowhere else for me to go. I had to stay in the caravan.""

Image: Ashleigh was moved to a caravan park to live

The care of children is in crisis, partly due to a national shortage of regulated children's homes. Councils have relied heavily on unregulated accommodation as a way of housing vulnerable children.

Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, told Sky News that she had urged the secretary of state to ban unregulated accommodation for under-18s.

""I asked him to go further and actually ban that provision for any child under 18 because they are the most vulnerable children who need the most support.

""Unregulated provision is what it says on the tin. These are places where there will obviously be very vulnerable children who often will be sharing accommodation with older adults.

""There may be addiction issues, there may be drugs, there may be criminality.

""There should be no instance where a child under the age of 18 who is in the care of the state should be left without proper supervision, proper support and the regulation around it to ensure that they are safeguarded against harm.""

An independent review into children's social care system is now under way, headed by Josh MacAllister.

A former teacher, Mr MacAlister founded the social work charity Frontline in 2013. He will step down from his role as chief executive to lead the review.

""The basic test for me is whether we can create a system which better guarantees for every single child growing up in England safety, stability and love as the bedrock of being able to go on and have a successful future and there are lots of things at the moment which are an obstacle to that.""

Carolyne Willow, director of the care rights group Article 39, said: ""The education secretary states in his foreword that he cannot imagine a circumstance in which a child under the age of 16 would be put somewhere where they don't receive care.

""But children aged 16 and 17 also need care. Today's shameful policy announcement entrenches a two-tier care system. Children who live with foster carers are already entitled to remain part of these families until they are 21.

""Yet the government is saying today that it is entirely legitimate for children who don't live with their own family or a foster family to be denied care from their 16th birthday.""

The group of Isle of Wight fishermen were jailed for a collective total of 104 years in 2011, after being found guilty of attempting to smuggle £53m of cocaine into the UK. They have maintained their innocence in the years since the conviction, with their battle to have the convictions overturned covered in a Guardian five-part podcast mini-series.

Two members of the Freshwater Five, Jonathan Beere, 51, and Daniel Payne, 46, are this week challenging their convictions, which led to them being jailed for 24 and 18 years respectively for conspiracy to import 250kg of the class A drug on to UK shores.

On the opening day of their trial, the court of appeal heard that new evidence showed it was “simply impossible” for the men to have collected the drugs.

At the original trial prosecution, lawyers argued that Payne – along with skipper Jamie Green, Zoran Dresic, and Scott Birtwistle – collected the vast quantity of drugs out of the English Channel in a fishing boat, the Galwad-Y-Mor, before tying them together and leaving them in the water by Freshwater Bay, off the coast of the Isle of Wight. Dresic was also sentenced to 24 years, while Birtwistle received a 14-year sentence.

Jon Beere, a scaffolding business owner, was found to have acted as a liaison between Green, who was also jailed for 24 years, and the criminal masterminds organising the smuggling.

In 2011, Kingston crown court heard the Galwad-Y-Mor crossed the path of the Oriane, a container ship sailing from Brazil, and slowed down to collect the cocaine in the middle of the night in May 2010. The jury was told that the next day the group had tied 11 holdalls containing the cocaine together using rope, and had deposited them in Freshwater Bay attached to a buoy before returning to land.

But at the appeal hearing on Tuesday, lawyers for Beere and Payne argued that new radar evidence showed that the Galwad-Y-Mor never crossed behind the Oriane and rendered their convictions unsafe. The original hearing heard evidence about the positioning of the vessels from a different source.

Joel Bennathan QC for the appellants told the court that data obtained from a UK Border Agency boat, the Vigilant, obtained seven years later and not examined in the original trial, “transforms the picture that was presented to the jury in 2011”.

He added: “The Galwad-Y-Mor did not, contrary to the evidence at trial, ever get sufficiently close to the origin or the trail of the Oriane to permit the transfer of the drugs.”

In written submissions, Bennathan said: “The correct interpretation of this new data shows that Galwad never crossed behind the Oriane.”

He added that the idea that the Galwad-Y-Mor had been able to “cooper” – a term used to describe goods being transferred from one vessel to another at sea – the drugs in high seas “reduces from being difficult but conceivable to being simply impossible”.

The submissions continue: “The possibility of the coopering of the cocaine mid-Channel by the Galwad was a central and determinative issue at trial. Once there are respectable experts mounting credible arguments that would render that coopering all but impossible, how can these convictions be seen as safe?”

Bennathan told the court that the Vigilant data also showed “another relatively small vessel traveling at high speed to Freshwater Bay, where the drugs were recovered and doing so shortly after the Galwad-Y-Mor had sailed nearby,” he told the court, which should be considered “an alternative suspect for depositing the drugs”.

The court heard that data from the Vigilant also showed a surveillance plane flying over Freshwater Bay around the time that the fishermen were said to have deposited the drugs in the water. “And yet there was no report from that surveillance aircraft of seeing anything in the water,” he said. Previously it had been understood that the aircraft could not have been flying over the bay at the moment of the deposit, but “a very recent bit of disclosure now means that argument is no longer sustainable,” he said.

Submissions from the prosecution, which will argue the men’s convictions are still safe, are expected to start on Thursday.

Bennathan said the evidence they were relying on to defend the appeals “cannot simply plug the gaps caused by what we now know”, adding: “In consequence, it will be our submission, of course, that both these applicants’ appeals leave should be given, and the appeals should be allowed.”

Speaking outside court before the hearing, Payne said being back at court felt “surreal”, and brought back negative memories of the original trial.

While he believed the case for appeal was strong, he added: “Me, personally, confidence in the British justice system is pretty low to be honest.”

The hearing before Sir Julian Flaux, Mr Justice Andrew Baker and Mr Justice Calver is due to conclude on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. The ruling is expected to be reserved until a later date.

Burlingame’s employer did not respond to a request for comment.

Burlingame was denied unemployment insurance by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, falling into the gaps between state and federal laws that only give limited protection to people who choose to quit work for safety reasons. He has been living without any income since July.

Burlingame is one of more than 1.5 million people who quit their jobs voluntarily last year and filed for unemployment insurance, according to data from the Department of Labor, more than twice the amount over the same period in 2019. Some 80 percent have had their claims denied. A separate group of 75,000 have applied for unemployment insurance after being laid off and declining to return to work; 49 percent of that group had their claims denied.

The statistics speak to an unfortunate legacy of the pandemic: Many workers have been forced to choose between a paycheck and their or their family’s health.

“My dad beat cancer twice,” Burlingame said. “I’m not going to bring something home to him and let him have two big wins beating cancer and then have this kind of thing shut him down because someone wanted their profit margin to be high.”

Complicating matters, a jobless claim gets treated differently under disparate state unemployment systems, pointing to the challenges facing the Biden administration, which seeks to cut down on the number of workers who have been denied unemployment assistance because they were concerned about the safety risks of going to work.

An executive action issued by President Biden in January directs the Department of Labor to clarify federal rules so that workers who refuse to go to unsafe workplaces will be more likely to be granted unemployment insurance. A White House official said the Department of Labor’s guidance will clarify what qualifies as an unsafe workplace.

“You could be denied unemployment insurance because you’re offered a job and you didn’t take it. It’s wrong,” Biden said, announcing the executive action last month. “No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic.”

The Washington Post interviewed more than a dozen people who said they quit their jobs, or declined to return to work after the reopenings last year because of fears about coronavirus infections. Another handful of workers said that they continued attending jobs they believed were unsafe because they did not think they would be granted unemployment insurance.

Nawal Abbas, 52, a Sudanese immigrant with blood cancer told The Post she worked for months at a Walmart in Iowa City during the pandemic, unaware that her health condition could qualify her for unemployment.

“If I stop, how I’m going to survive?” she said in Arabic, with translation from an advocate at the Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa, which has helped Abbas with her rent. “And if I work, I might die, too.”

All spoke of the impossible decision they faced.

Many spoke of months of back-and-forth calls with unemployment administrators, watching bank accounts dwindle as they struggled to get by without a paycheck or aid. And many said they had high hopes that the executive order could result in their receiving some support at long last.

“I was absolutely elated,” said Troy Williamson, 29, who hasn’t received any unemployment aid since he quit his job at a day-care center in Toledo over the summer, worried about his high-risk girlfriend and concerned about a lack of proper safety precautions at his workplace. “This is something that really needs to happen. Not just for myself — there are so many people who need this help.”

But experts caution that the executive order’s influence could depend on how the Biden administration defines “unsafe workplaces,” as well as the complicated dynamics between federal and state unemployment law and administration.

Workers who quit their jobs voluntarily may still have trouble getting unemployment benefits, experts say. The new order appears to help only those who are already unemployed or who turn down return-to-work offers or other employment offers because the workplaces are unsafe.

Story continues below advertisement

To qualify for unemployment benefits, workers who quit their jobs for safety reasons face a higher threshold than those who turn down work: Typically they have to show that not only was there a significant health risk in the workplace, but also that they first sought to remedy their concerns by bringing them to their employers’ attention, according to George Wentworth, an unemployment expert at the National Employment Law Project.

That hasn’t always worked out for workers like Williamson, who said he raised safety concerns with administrators and managers repeatedly after the day-care center reopened before quitting — and communicated that in his unemployment claim. He also complained to the county health department. The day-care center did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

These provisions are complicated by other factors as well: the unprecedented volume of jobless claims that have swamped underfunded state unemployment agencies and the way that unemployment benefits became politicized, like many other issues raised by the pandemic.

Story continues below advertisement

Many Republican-led states pressured people to go back to work during the reopening push last spring, warning that those who turned down suitable work would be penalized, amid concerns workers would take advantage of historically generous unemployment benefits available at the time. Oklahoma, Ohio, Tennessee and Iowa even set up specific channels for businesses to report employees who turned down work.

Businesses have been in a difficult position when it comes to unemployment insurance during the pandemic, said Kevin Kuhlman, a vice president at the National Federation of Independent Business.

“They had either had employees decline the job offer or had to offer higher salaries for employees to return,” he said. “Our overall concern is just, you know, inserting more friction between the small-business owners and small-business employees.”

The Labor Department under President Donald Trump signaled support for restrictions, writing in guidance last spring that “barring unusual circumstances, a request that a furloughed employee return to his or her job very likely constitutes an offer of suitable employment that the employee must accept.”

Experts said that a more worker-friendly interpretation of federal unemployment laws could push some state unemployment agencies to side more frequently with workers who turn down employment that poses a significant risk to them.

“The fact that the Department of Labor hasn’t pushed back when governors or other officials make statements that are running roughshod over a thoughtful, reasoned application of the law to the facts has been problematic,” Wentworth said.

For their part, workers told The Post of the challenging decision they faced early on in the pandemic, with most having little awareness of the technicalities of their state’s unemployment insurance laws.

James Burrus, 54, who worked as a poker dealer at a casino in Maryland before the pandemic, said he did not even file for unemployment insurance after declining to return to work during the reopening in late June, fearing for the safety of himself and his asthmatic 13-year-old daughter. He said he was not able to get clear information from the state about whether he was eligible. He did not want to be accused of fraud and potentially be told he owed the government money.

Ashley Vacek, 23, who lives outside of Houston, said she was denied unemployment by Texas after quitting her secretary job at a veterinary clinic in December.

She said nearly half of the couple dozen workers at the clinic came down with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. After taking herself to get tested for at least the fourth time, Vacek said, she decided to quit, wanting to protect herself and family members, like her fiance’s father and her pregnant sister.

On her unemployment benefits application, she detailed what she said were basic safety lapses at the clinic, describing clients not wearing masks and a lack of sanitizing procedures, she said.

Her claim was denied within days, she said. Her sister was also denied unemployment after quitting a job for similar reasons, she said.

“I feel like I shouldn’t have had to be put in the position — where you either choose to be healthy or choose to keep making money,” Vacek said.

Other workers spoke about the real costs of the pressure they felt to continue working.

Harry Wilson, an 83-year-old from Denver, Iowa, left his part-time job at supermarket chain Hy-Vee in March over health concerns. Wilson’s age, heart disease and COPD made him high-risk for the coronavirus and therefore “unable to work,” according to a health provider’s note later submitted to a judge. He received unemployment insurance through April.

Later, the state told him he never should have gotten the money and ordered him to pay back $4,835.

Wilson spent months appealing the decision and finally reapplying for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which covers workers told to stay home by a doctor because they are highly vulnerable to covid-19, according to guidance from the Department of Labor.

But state employment officials and a judge said he did not qualify. Iowa Workforce Development, the state’s employment agency, did not respond to questions about their policies and specific workers.

By then it was late October. Wilson was supporting a daughter with cancer, he said, and still under orders to pay back thousands of dollars in benefits.

He decided it was time to go back to work.

Within a couple of weeks of his return, Wilson said, the telltale symptoms showed up: coughing, achy bones, a headache. Wilson tested positive for the coronavirus. Soon, his 82-year-old wife came down with it as well, a bout so severe she needed to be hospitalized and put on oxygen. Wilson feared for her life, but she recovered.

Wilson is back at work now. Hy-Vee confirmed he works for the chain but did not comment further. Wilson’s jobless benefits from March through December were finally granted on Dec. 21, after his story was covered by the Des Moines Register.

“I was kind of disgusted with them for taking so long,” Wilson said.

Biden’s executive action could help workers like Wilson get jobless benefits more quickly. But states will still have significant authority over the process, said Matthew Bodie, an expert in employment law at Saint Louis University School of Law, noting how broadly worded Biden’s order is.

The order itself says that government agencies should “promptly identify actions they can take within existing authorities” to address the economic crisis caused by the virus. An accompanying fact sheet is more specific, saying Biden wants the Department of Labor to “consider clarifying that workers who refuse unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance.”

“I don’t know how much that’s going to change things on the ground, though, because I think the red states will still be kind of tougher and the blue states will still be more open-ended,” Bodie said.

Still, many unemployed workers say they have high hopes the Biden administration will make it easier for workers trying to keep themselves or their families safe to receive jobless benefits.

“It’s been one thing after another that just brings you down and gives you less and less hope every time,” Burlingame said. “And this was the first thing where someone finally said, ‘Hey, you’re not replaceable. You matter to us, and we’re going to try to do something to help you out.’ ”"

Carol McGuinness, 60, who has rheumatoid arthritis and respiratory problems, said she has been complaining to the housing association about severe disrepair issues at her three-bedroom terrace home in Liverpool for around five years.

Carol and her son Michael, who also lives there and has heart failure, said there have been 58 issues in total with the property, including a rat infestation in her garden, damp, leaks, faulty electrics, mould and cracks. There has also been blocked drainage, a hole in the ceiling, defective radiators and broken windows, they allege.

Carol and Michael say that while repairs were being carried out, they were moved into temporary accommodation which they discovered is a “former drug den”, which was in even worse condition.

Legal action

They say being forced to isolate and shield during the Covid-19 pandemic in a house in such poor condition has hugely impacted both of their mental health.

Last year the mother and son took legal action, but the housing association, despite paying compensation and promising to fix the issues, failed to carry out the works, according to CEL Solicitors, which specialises in housing disrepair.

Your Housing Group has apologised and claims all repairs reported in 2019 were completed and the tenants have recently raised new repair requests which they intend to fix.

Carol said: “After initially moving back home and the works starting up, it all stopped again, and my doctor told me it simply wasn’t safe for me to stay there.”

Social housing reforms

Long-awaited social housing reforms were announced last November, more than three years after the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster.

The Charter for Social Housing Residents’ white paper sets out what tenants can expect from a landlord, including to be safe in their home and to know how the landlord is performing in areas such as repairs, complaints and safety.

It’s been promised that tenants will be treated with respect and have their voices heard by landlords, for example through regular meetings, scrutiny panels or being on its board.

It also promises a strengthened housing regulator through a “new arm” to ensure robust oversight of landlords in these areas.

The Government has not yet given any indication about when these changes will be brought into effect.

While the reforms are welcomed by many, campaigners say the chronic shortage of social housing desperately needs addressing. The building of new social rented homes has significantly reduced over the past decade, contributing to the sharp rise in homelessness and people living in temporary accommodation.

The number of households in England in need of social housing is 1.6 million, according to The National Housing Federation, and just over 6,000 social homes were built between March 2019 and April 2020, the lowest level since the 1980s. Housing charity Shelter has warned that “any new dawn for social renters must come with major investment in new homes too”.

It’s also argued that tenants of the 4.5m privately rented homes in the UK need better protection.

‘I just don’t sleep… My mental health has suffered significantly’

After moving into the temporary accommodation in December 2019, Carol moved out after a month because it was “unsafe” and is now temporarily staying with her sister. Michael continued to live there for a year before being forced to move back into their original home.

Michael, 33, said: “The temporary home was shocking – there were cages over the windows, so there was no clear fire exit. On our third night there was nearly a fire when the electric metre exploded.

“The police told us it was a drug den and someone had tampered with the metre. There was water running down the walls, flooring issues, and the heater was never working.

“One of the windows was coming out of the frame and we had three attempted burglaries while we were there. There had been no real attempts to convert it back into a safe, suitable home. My mum’s doctor said he wouldn’t let her stay in that home either.”

Michael says Your Housing Group promised again to complete the repairs by October last year, which still haven’t been done satisfactorily, he claims.

The housing association paid Carol £2,000 in compensation, but Michael says the money doesn’t offset the stress. “In our original home where I am now, there are rodents in my bedroom and I just don’t sleep. My mental health, and my mum’s, has suffered significantly as well lately and on top of physical issues.

“The housing association say we are raising new repairs but this just isn’t true. Repairs they say they carried out haven’t been. There are two tunnels outside of the back gate that are giving the rodents access throughout the house which they say have been filled in but there’s definitely no cement in them. All we get is broken promises.”

Cases like this ‘are not a rarity’

CEL Solicitors say the disrepair issues at Carol’s home fall under the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018, which came into full force in March last year, creating a legal obligation for both social and private landlords to ensure their properties are safe, healthy and free from hazard.

Repairs paralegal Gavin Spruin said: “Unfortunately, cases like Ms McGuinness’s are not a rarity. Housing associations are putting some of the country’s most vulnerable people at risk by allowing this to happen and refusing to make, or needlessly delaying, vital repairs. This is not something we will stand for and we will continue to hold landlords to account.”

Jacque Allen, Your Housing Group’s chief operating officer, said: “We have previously carried out repairs that the customer reported through to us in 2019 and all those repairs were completed. Our customer has recently raised new repair requests and we have already arranged for a surveyor to visit the property and assess any works that are required.

“We apologise for any inconvenience and upset caused to our customer, we will carry out any necessary repairs that are identified and continue to keep our customer updated.”

37,2021-02-23 00:00:00,BC Tests Found Unsafe Lead Levels in Water of 35 First Nation Schools,https://thetyee.ca/News/2021/02/23/BC-Tests-Found-Unsafe-Lead-Levels-Water-35-First-Nations-Schools/,"Health authorities began testing nearby schools for copper and lead and found elevated levels in the drinking water at several schools in the community.
Unsafe levels of lead were found in 26 per cent of the taps tested in non-First Nation schools between 2016 and 2017.
Andrew has been a water operator for over 20 years and his work has been recognized by the BC Water and Wastewater Association.
and 191 of them have a total of 333 on-reserve water systems that are part of the FNHA Drinking Water Safety Program.
Metlakatla First Nation water operator Dallas Leighton says it’s really important that pH is monitored on a constant basis.","nations, lead, schools, water, bc, drinking, tests, levels, unsafe, 35, nation, community, school",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"When Trever Andrew found out there was a small amount of lead leaching into the tap water in the girl’s washroom at T'selcéwtqen Clleq'mel'ten/Chief Atahm School, he knew it was important to act fast. There is no safe level of lead exposure and children are particularly vulnerable. In adults, lead exposure increases the risk of high blood pressure and kidney damage. In children, lead can affect the development of the brain and nervous system, causing learning disabilities and behavioural disorders.

Looking back, Andrew, who is the water operator for the Adams Lake Indian Band on the edge of Little Shuswap Lake, understood the consequences of lead in water can be “quite dramatic.”

But if Andrew had waited for official guidance on what to do next, he might have been frustrated. Sources at First Nations schools in B.C. say dealing with water worries can mean facing a confluence of confusing bureaucracy, secrecy and funding scarcity.

Thirty-five schools in First Nations across the province had unsafe levels of lead in their drinking water, according to a 2018 briefing note prepared for Health Minister Adrian Dix obtained by the Institute for Investigative Journalism. The tests, done in 2017, were conducted by the First Nations Health Authority in 261 different daycares and schools on reserves across the province. The authority is responsible for the delivery of health programs and services to First Nations in B.C.

What the FNHA discovered should not have come as a total surprise, given that water testing in all B.C. schools had revealed nearly a quarter of those tested had lead problems, and public money and effort had been invested in tackling the issue.

But First Nation schools in B.C. face several barriers to taking similar measures to ensure water is lead-free, reveals an investigation that is part of the project “Clean Water, Broken Promises,” led by Concordia University’s Institute for Investigative Journalism with a consortium of universities and media outlets. Reporting for this article was done in collaboration with The Tyee and journalism students at the University of British Columbia.

Once lead is discovered in a First Nation school in B.C., the obstacles can start with getting money to fix the problem. On top of these funding challenges, Indigenous communities described a lack of transparency, support and guidance from government bodies to ensure safe water.

The First Nations Health Authority would not provide the names of the schools where elevated lead levels were measured or say what, if any, specific steps were taken to protect children in those schools. “We are only responsible for the water testing, which is done according to best practices on a regular basis,” said an FNHA spokesperson via email. “The results are shared with community along with any recommendations the officers might have.”

The spokesperson referred reporters to Indigenous Services Canada, stating that First Nations in B.C. work with the federal government on next steps.

Indigenous Services Canada wouldn’t provide specifics, but said if lead is found in drinking water, it provides funding for any remedial measures needed. It pointed back to FNHA, saying that provincial authority “has taken on the responsibility” for sampling water and giving health advice and technical support to First Nations communities in B.C. “For drinking water sampling questions, please contact the FNHA.”

In a February 2020 briefing note, Indigenous Services Canada stated that “no system-wide drinking water advisories regarding lead are in place and we continue to monitor children's facilities, including schools. If lead exceedances are found in drinking water, we work together with First Nation community leaders to implement remedial actions such as flushing or the replacement of affected taps.”

Adams Lake Indian Band water operator Andrew describes the relationships between water operators for First Nations like himself, FNHA and Indigenous Services Canada as “dysfunctional.”

He says he received no direction from FNHA after it provided the drinking water test results that tipped him off to elevated levels of lead at his community’s school. Andrew said he didn’t go to Indigenous Services Canada because, after 20 years on the job, he felt his funding request would just get denied.

Andrew decided to take action anyway — even though the lead, he says, wasn’t above the maximum acceptable limit at the time. By the time Andrew was done, he had replaced the tap and sink and added new fittings.

“I just stripped it right down and made sure that I had everything covered. But there’s no instructions to say rip it down, right? I just went ahead,” said Andrew. “And there’s no recommendations in how to address it. So I just stripped everything down, I did my research and found out where it was coming from, put in all new parts and then I resampled and it came back negative.”

Whether similarly thorough actions have been taken to safeguard the health of children in 35 First Nations schools and daycares identified to have lead issues is not clear. Such facts appear to be hidden even from public scrutiny.

For First Nations, more obstacles

Testing for lead in water in B.C.’s schools started after a class in Kitimat noticed salmon eggs in their aquarium were dying. In 2012, a school staff member alerted Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which tested the school’s water and found the school had eight times the safe level of copper. Health authorities began testing nearby schools for copper and lead and found elevated levels in the drinking water at several schools in the community.

As more tests came in, multiple health agencies recommended routine testing in schools across the province. By 2017, the B.C. government made regular testing in public and independent schools for lead in drinking water the law. Schools are expected to work with their local health authority to test for lead and have a clear communication plan in place for sharing results. First Nation band-operated schools work with the FNHA.

Unsafe levels of lead were found in 26 per cent of the taps tested in non-First Nation schools between 2016 and 2017. In some cases, schools had levels more than 100 times the safe limit set by Health Canada at the time. Affected schools responded with a range of solutions in consultation with their regional health authority, including plumbing upgrades, installing lead removal filtration systems, deactivating water sources, putting up signs and flushing to remove stagnant water, according to the Ministry of Education.

By 2017, the provincial government made $7.25 million available through grants for schools to fix or replace lead or copper piping. Six schools received “accelerated investment.”

“My goal is to have every student in B.C. attend a healthy and safe school, and this is another step toward achieving that goal. We know we have more work to do, and that is why we are accelerating capital investments throughout B.C.,” stated then-education minister Rob Fleming.

Public schools in B.C. have access to an annual facilities grant to address routine maintenance, including health and safety issues, which is currently $115.5 million.

It was “fairly easy” to get funding to address lead problems in School District 27, said manager of facilities and transportation Alex Telford. The Cariboo-Chilcotin school region has 22 schools, many of them rural, with 13 getting their water from wells.

In 2017, more than a third of the tested fixtures in the district had elevated levels of lead in the drinking water. A few schools in the district received funding to re-pipe and the rest got funding to replace their drinking fountains. Telford says the lead filter fountains were approximately $1,500 each, costing the entire district about $30,000. They’ve also added some funding to their budget to replace the filters about once a year as part of preventative measures.

But First Nation schools on reserves don’t qualify for any of these grants, as their infrastructure funding comes from Indigenous Services Canada.

“I’m lucky it was just one sink,” says Andrew of the Adams Lake Indian Band, who estimates it cost $300 to $500 to replace the plumbing and fixture. He worries that other communities might have far more expensive problems and no guidance or specific budget to address them. The Institute for Investigative Journalism surveyed 122 water operators in First Nations across the country. Many said they feel there isn’t enough funding to address water-related problems in their communities. They face tough choices about how to spend limited money in their operations and maintenance budgets meant to address the needs of the entire community.

“First Nations, for years, have been fighting to get safe drinking water,” said Chief William Seymour of Cowichan Tribes. Cowichan Tribes is the largest First Nation Band in B.C. with over 4,900 members. Their traditional territory covers much of southeastern Vancouver Island extending across the Strait of Georgia. About half their members live on reserve lands, most of which were placed in the floodplain of the Cowichan or Koksilah Rivers by the federal government, which causes damage to homes and contaminates drinking wells.

Parts of the community living on reserve didn’t have access to clean water for almost three decades, until hooking up to the nearby city of Duncan’s water system in 2018. It was a major undertaking.

“I've got community members that have never been able to bathe or shower, or cook without boiling water. So it's a change for them to have something safe.” Today, some parts of the community have arsenic in the water and a new agreement with Duncan hopes to address that, says Seymour.

Told that 35 First Nations schools and daycares in the province tested positive for lead in their water, Seymour responded, “One is too many.”

Cowichan Tribes’ new source of water doesn’t mean it’s immune to the lead problem. While the daycare, elementary school and middle school on reserve are all hooked up to Duncan’s municipal water system, lead and copper can find its way into drinking water through older plumbing, faucets or drinking fountains.

Neither the Cowichan Tribes health director nor the supervisor for the community water testers was able to confirm if FNHA provided the 2017 water testing results for lead and copper in schools to the community.

‘You’re competing against each other’

When school administrator Edith Loring-Kuhanga joined Stein Valley Nlakapamux School about four years ago, she knew that getting access to their school’s water data was important. Before working at at the school, Loring-Kuhanga was on Greater Victoria’s water advisory committee and served as the board chair for the Greater Victoria School District. While she was on the board, the school district installed new water fountains, bottle fillers and in-line filtrations systems in all 47 schools to reduce lead in drinking water.

Stein Valley Nlakapamux School is part of Lytton First Nation and is a registered independent school and a member of B.C. First Nations Schools Association. First Nation schools are either operated by the band or through an independent body. First Nation schools are outside the province’s jurisdiction unless they choose to also become a certified independent school. Loring-Kuhanga is from the House of Gwininitxw, Gitxsan Nation, and has navigated both the public school system and the First Nation schools.

Loring-Kuhanga says she always requests the reports from water testing done by the FNHA. “And if they forget that, I usually follow up because one of the other things that has to happen is, if you're an independent school, and you're registered under the Ministry of Education, you have to follow those same guidelines that all public schools have to follow.”

As a newer facility erected 11 years ago, Stein Valley Nlakapamux School hasn’t had a lot of issues regarding lead in the water, Loring-Kuhanga says. Changes to B.C.’s plumbing code introduced in 1989 limited the use of lead in plumbing, so schools built after 1989 are at lower risk of having elevated levels in their water, according to an FNHA fact sheet.

But until 2014, national regulations allowed faucets made principally of brass to be as much as eight per cent lead. And lead has been found in water in B.C. schools built up until 2014.

Loring-Kuhanga says FNHA still recommends that they flush the water fountains and taps in the kitchen every morning for about 30 seconds as a safety measure.

If Stein Valley Nlakapamux School were to discover lead in its water, it would be important to respond quickly. But a cumbersome process stands in the way.

The school wouldn’t be able to get funds from the same provincial annual facilities grant that non-First Nation schools can access. Instead it would have to apply to Indigenous Services Canada in a process that also looks at the needs of the entire community and is reviewed every three years.

It’s as if B.C. public schools were made to compete with municipalities for capital investments, explains Loring-Kuhang. And if you miss your funding opportunity, you have to wait three more years to re-apply.

“When you have competing needs in the community, it's really difficult because you're competing against each other.” She ticks off all the entities vying for slices of the same pie, including all community buildings, perhaps another school or daycare, the band office, housing. Even the operations and maintenance department responsible for keeping water supplies safe draws its budget from the same overall source. “So you're competing with all of that.”

Sometimes outside funding is a possibility. But to try for it takes the time and skill to write proposals, and the experience to know where to look, says Loring-Kuhanga.

“And so for schools who don't have that extra, they just get further and further behind, because they can't do all of what's being expected of them, because they don't have the funding to do it.” She believes having a more streamlined funding approach for First Nations schools could help make the process easier.

Indigenous Services Canada officials responsible for water safety in First Nations schools declined an interview request and in an email confirmed there is no specific fund to deal with lead in First Nation schools and that communities apply for funding through the Capital Facilities Maintenance program. Part of that program includes “$969.4 million over five years, starting in 2016-2017, for the construction, repair and maintenance of First Nations education facilities” across Canada. Indigenous Services Canada could not confirm how much funding has gone towards addressing any lead issues in schools.

But in January, the Institute for Investigative Journalism conducted a wide-ranging interview with federal Minister of Indigenous Affairs Marc Miller in which he said that Indigenous Services Canada works with the priorities of the community to address clean water and acknowledged old piping in schools can be an issue. ""Anytime that's raised, I think there's a real keen interest to ensure that any projects relating to fixing acceptable lead situations are remedied quickly.""

A simple test, a ‘big concern’

Communities in coastal B.C. are naturally more at risk for lead exposure in drinking water. That’s because many of them get their water from lakes replenished solely or mostly by rainfall, and that rainfall tends to be acidic.

When that acidic water makes its way through plumbing, it can corrode the pipes and pull lead and copper into drinking water. While B.C. restricted lead in plumbing over 30 years ago, trace amounts can still be found in faucets and solders used to join pipes. In 2018, investigations by IIJ found acidic water in dozens of communities across B.C., creating a higher risk of lead leaching into drinking water because of old pipes or plumbing.

The way to know whether water is acidic enough to cause corrosion and potential lead and copper poisoning is to do a pH test.

But more than one out of three water operators for First Nations in B.C. surveyed by the Institute for Investigative Journalism didn’t immediately know the pH of their water systems, some saying they don't test pH as part of their role.

Andrew has been a water operator for over 20 years and his work has been recognized by the BC Water and Wastewater Association. He says that water operators should “absolutely” know the pH of their own systems. “What causes lead to leach into your water system is that it could have a low pH to it. So that means it’s corroding or it’s slowly eating away at the lead or the lead fittings or the lead pipe,” explains Andrew. Testing the pH levels of the water is one way to flag any potential corrosion.

Yet many of the 41 surveyed water operators in First Nations in B.C. said they relied on someone else to test pH levels and share with them the results — either the FNHA or the operator of a municipal water system they used.

FNHA has a lot of water to monitor. There are over 200 First Nations across B.C. and 191 of them have a total of 333 on-reserve water systems that are part of the FNHA Drinking Water Safety Program. On top of that, there are more than 1,300 well clusters or private systems that are also periodically monitored by FNHA.

The First Nations Health Authority does chemical testing on all First Nations community water systems every five years, and in 2015 reported no samples were above the drinking water guideline levels for copper and lead. FNHA did not provide the results of its 2020 tests.

One water quality expert finds it “really shocking” that so many water operators said they don’t do pH tests themselves or know the pH of their water. “That’s a big concern,” said Charles-François de Lannoy, an assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at McMaster University. He’s part of an interdisciplinary team of McMaster researchers analyzing contaminants in the water and co-developing solutions to water quality issues on reserves with Six Nations of the Grand River.

His work convinces him there should be regular, rigorous testing on reserves for not only lead but mercury, cadmium and arsenic, he says. “These are found in trace levels and even though they’re very small concentrations, they can cause chronic harm in consistent, chronic exposure,” says de Lannoy. Water is part of everyday life, we have to be exposed to it to live.

Experience shows testing can sound valuable alarms. Documents obtained by the Institute for Investigative Journalism consortium via access-to-information request revealed tests conducted by the City of Prince Rupert in 2019 measured elevated levels of lead in the tap water of 41 out of 65 homes. Health Canada’s current guidelines for measured lead in water is five parts per billion, or ppb. Municipal testing in Pemberton revealed lead levels as high as 107 ppb in 2016. Tests conducted by students from the University of British Columbia in the City of Whistler in 2019 found elevated levels of lead in seven out of 10 homes constructed before 1994. Unlike other provincial governments, B.C. did not implement regulatory changes in response to the Institute for Investigative Journalism consortium’s findings.

While testing for heavy metals is expensive, testing for pH is easy and inexpensive and pH meters are widely available, said de Lannoy. “Without having an infinite number of resources to test every single water main in every single city every week, you have to be judicious about where you test.”

Having water operators check and monitor pH is an inexpensive way to monitor any red flags in a community’s water quality, he said.

But many water operators in First Nations the Institute for Investigative Journalism spoke to throughout the course of a year-long investigation described feeling overworked and underpaid compared to municipal counterparts and pointed to a severe lack of funding for training and operations and maintenance.

Metlakatla First Nation water operator Dallas Leighton says it’s really important that pH is monitored on a constant basis. The community is about five kilometres north of Prince Rupert on a site that’s been occupied for thousands of years by the Metlakatla people.

Leighton, who has been a water operator for over 10 years, believes that high turnover, lack of training and low wages are likely why some water operators didn’t know the pH levels of their community water systems when surveyed.

Last year, the Institute for Investigative Journalism tested one of the taps at Metlakatla’s daycare and found 0.29 ppb of lead which is well below Health Canada’s guideline. Leighton says FNHA’s 2017 testing also showed that there were no issues with the water in the daycare.

“What makes Metlakatla successful is basically we’ve kept a commitment to the community and kept all our water operators trained,” Leighton said. He also points out that the community has access to other funding outside of Indigenous Services Canada through the Metlakatla Development Corp., the business arm of the Metlakatla First Nation, to help fund their training.

Leighton is currently one of two certified water operators for the on-reserve community of about 120 people, and says the rest of his team is getting more training. While COVID-19 has made training a little more challenging, Leighton says they’ve continued with online courses.

Caught in a ‘jurisdictional juggle’

Jim F. Brown, a member of Lytton First Nation, started First Nation Operator Waters Net, a support group for water operators in B.C. and Yukon that aims to bring attention to the expertise of water operators in community decision-making.

“I think the frustration a lot of the operators are having is there’s no support from First Nation Health Authority,” said Brown. He was the water operator for Lytton First Nation for over 35 years until he resigned in 2016. Lytton First Nation’s 56 reserves are scattered in a 100-kilometre radius between Hope and Cache Creek on both sides of the Fraser River. A small part of the community has been on a do-not-consume advisory since 2013.

Like Andrew, Brown thinks the FNHA and Indigenous Services Canada bureaucracies need to work together better to help First Nations know about and deal with lead and other toxins in their water. “If there's high levels of lead, then they can make a recommendation to whoever is going to make a decision to look into it further.”

Coty Zachariah, with the Southern Chiefs’ Organization, says government confusion and inertia are endemic to the ongoing water crisis in Indigenous communities across Canada. The organization represents 34 Anishinaabe and Dakota communities in what is now called southern Manitoba. “This is a situation that the government created, by pushing us off into the margins,” he said. “The roots of this are a systemic discrimination.”

Sixty-six long-term water advisories and dozens of short-term water advisories are in place across the country and access to water remains a major challenge for many communities.

Through colonization, the Canadian government forced Indigenous people onto reserves and created the Indian Act to undermine thousands of years of traditional self-governance. Colonizers tried to destroy the structure and hierarchy of First Nations as well as their established ways of sustaining their health, education and culture.

The government “put us on reserves and took us away from our water source,” says Brown. Indigenous communities were forced into areas without reliable water and that history is “probably one of the biggest reasons we have all these boil water advisories.”

Today, First Nations people across the country are caught in a “jurisdictional juggle,” says Zachariah. “It wastes a lot of time having to go and plead that case to whichever government will listen, whether provincial or federal,” he says.

“In the meantime, people are still getting sick from the water. In the meantime the water quality still goes down, from a myriad of issues.”

Zachariah, from Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte, Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, says lack of access to data and the ability to do their own testing has prevented First Nations from tackling water issues. So this summer, members of the Southern Chiefs’ Organization travelled to 25 First Nations in southern Manitoba to conduct their own water testing.

The team tested the water for total metal content, dissolved oxygen, E. coli, total coliform bacteria and phosphorus levels with the goal of presenting a report to the community and creating a regional database.

“I know that we have to provide the information, but I’m scared at how drastic those numbers are going to be,” he said. “And it highlights the need for consistent, annual monitoring, which is what we’re going to do, because we can’t rely on anybody else to give us those numbers.”

Trever Andrew decided to take matters into his own hands by developing an app that tracks all his community’s water data. It gives him instant access to any measurements he takes and lets him share that data with leaders. The app is called Sewllkwe, which means “water” in the language of the Secwepemc people. The Sexqéltkemc te Secwepemc (People of the Shuswap Lakes Region) which includes the Adams Lake Indian Band, have traditional territories from Sts’xum (Monte Creek) to B.C.’s Rocky Mountains.

“With innovation and tech, you can organize. You can clear the hierarchy,” says Andrew. When communities and water operators have access to their own data in a transparent and easy-to-manage format, they can detect trends and advocate for specific solutions, he says.

The long-term solution, says Zachariah, is “First Nations control.”

The Atlantic First Nations Water Authority signed a framework agreement in June to transfer water and wastewater services to 15 First Nations in Atlantic Canada from Indigenous Services Canada. Now the Southern Chiefs’ Organization is working on a proposal to create a First Nations water authority for their communities.

“Generations of neglect have got us into this situation,” says Zachariah. “It’s going to take generations of investment, generations of capacity building and generations of handing over the keys of the things that you took.”

Such injuries, which often have a lasting impact on the workers' lives and livelihoods, are preventable, stressed Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad on Thursday (March 25) when he launched this year's Safe Hands Campaign.

""We need to persevere in our efforts to ensure such incidents do not recur,"" he said, as he encouraged companies to embrace a culture of reporting near misses.

The campaign, an initiative by the Workplace Safety and Health Council, focuses on raising awareness on machinery safety and practices to avoid hand and finger injuries.

Mr Zaqy said that there were 1,756 injuries due to machinery incidents last year, down from 2,262 in 2019.

But he pointed out that the drop could be due to the circuit breaker period and the suspension of business activities then.

""Overall, for the manufacturing sector, machinery incidents still account for nearly one-third of all injuries in the sector, so we must continue to press on,"" he added.

Last month, 11 workers died in nine separate workplace accidents. Some of the fatalities involved the use of machinery such as forklifts.

""These tragic accidents provide a stark reminder that if not used properly, machines can lead to needless loss of lives, not just the loss of hands or fingers,"" said Mr Zaqy, urging firms to conduct a safety time-out to review their practices and assess possible risks.

While Singapore has resumed almost all its manufacturing activities since the end of the circuit breaker on June 1 last year, workplace safety and health cannot be taken for granted as firms catch up on order delays or adjust their operations, he said.

""Every accident and every life lost is one too many.""

The campaign is held in collaboration with the Singapore Manufacturing Federation. Last year, some 560 firms pledged their commitment towards enforcing greater safety.

Mr Zaqy called on more employers to take proactive steps to ensure their workers' safety.

These include installing machine guards, which prevent operators from having their hands and fingers caught between moving parts, or light curtains, which are sensors that can detect if an operator's fingers get too close to a machine's moving parts.

While such measures are a necessary first step, a company's management has to ensure the guards are maintained and are not intentionally removed for the sake of convenience.

""Companies cannot delegate this responsibility to the workers,"" he noted. They should also be receptive to feedback and act immediately when lapses are flagged."

Because of their size, speed and high-horsepower drive motors, conveyors pose a number of risks to personnel working on or near them. In addition to all of the physical danger zones, when an injury occurs, “fault” is often attributed to injured workers’ actions or inactions. However, safety experts point out that injuries generally occur due to a series of factors.

“Accidents are typically a result of a complex combination of probabilities, rather than a single unsafe act,” observed Martin Engineering Process Engineer Daniel Marshall. “Except for the unsafe act, it can be said that the accident would not have occurred if there was a safer design, better maintenance or less pressure for production.”

Assessing the risk of a conveyor

A thorough risk assessment by trained professionals is the ideal way to bridge the gap between workers and managers when the rules need review, to identify hazards and implement controls to reduce risks. “A belt conveyor is a powerful machine with thousands of moving parts,” Marshall continued. “These moving components might severely injure a worker, and can produce that injury in a fraction of a second.”

A typical conveyor belt moves at a relatively constant speed, commonly running between 0.5 to 10 meters per second (≈100 to 2000 fpm). At the very minimum, a worker who inadvertently touches a running conveyor belt–even with world-class reaction time and total focus on the danger of a conveyor–will come in contact with at least one carrying idler, and the potential is there to hit return idlers, chute uprights, stringer supports, pulleys and drives. The results are often disastrous.

Working around a moving conveyor

It’s been estimated that 2/3 of the fatalities involving conveyor belts take place while the belt is moving, usually as a result of a worker becoming entangled or crushed by moving equipment. The majority of these take place when maintenance or housekeeping is being done on or around an energized conveyor.

These fatalities are generally caused by two compounding practices. The first is performing maintenance without thoroughly locking, tagging, blocking and testing the conveyor. Another unsafe practice is touching a moving conveyor belt with a tool or implement of any kind. When these two choices are combined, the results are usually severe and often fatal. Even working on a conveyor that is turned off, but not locked out, can lead to tragedy.

Workaround and shortcuts

“An intelligent and creative worker will often invent or discover ways to expedite certain functions or make work easier,” Marshall said. “Unfortunately, some of these shortcuts bypass safety hardware and/or best practices, putting the worker in harm’s way.”

The most common of these workarounds involves the improper locking out of a conveyor system. The purpose of a lockout is to de-energize all sources of energy, whether latent or active. Failure to properly lockout can exist in many forms -- varying from disregarding lockout requirements, to working on a moving conveyor, to improperly stopping the conveyor. An example would be pulling the emergency-stop cord and assuming that the conveyor is de-energized.

Another common workaround involves entering a confined space without following established procedures. A confined space is any enclosure that is large enough and configured so that an employee can enter and perform assigned work, has limited or restricted means for entry or exit and is not designed for continuous employee occupancy. Very specific rules apply to workers when dealing with confined spaces. Failure to follow those rules can result in increased danger or death.

Other potential unsafe behaviors include crossing a conveyor in a risky manner. Conveyor belts are often lengthy systems bisecting a production facility. Workers may be required to cross a conveyor line to get to an area that is in need of service or maintenance. To save time, a worker is likely to step over or cross under a conveyor.

Crossing under offers multiple hazards. If any of the worker’s body parts come in contact with the moving conveyor, it will either act like a grinder and abrade the skin or pull the worker toward rolling components. Crossing under also places the worker at risk from falling objects.

Crossing over a conveyor without using a designed and designated crossover structure offers dangers, as well. There is a high potential for a slip and fall. If lucky, the worker may fall on the ground; if not, the worker will fall onto the conveyor belt. If the conveyor is in operation, the worker may be carried downstream. This can result in contact with the conveyor structure and rolling components or being thrown off the conveyor at the discharge. The safe approach to crossing a conveyor is to use a designated crossover or cross-under point engineered for that purpose.

Anything in a worker’s line of travel is a potential obstruction. These can range from piles of spillage, items lying on the walkway or work areas, as well as low overheads. An obstruction can cause several hazards, the most obvious being the opportunity for a trip or fall. If the obstruction is in the middle of the walkway, a worker will have to go around it. If that revised path brings the worker closer to a conveyor, this decision places the worker closer to the hazards of the conveyor.

Neglected safety and control mechanisms

“Emergency-stop pull cords are the last line of defense if the belt needs to be stopped quickly in response to an entrapment or impending equipment failure,” Marshall added. “The reaction time when such an event occurs is usually extremely brief, so workers need a way to stop the conveyor as fast as possible. In addition, the belt will not halt immediately and must coast to a stop. If the cord is broken, the switch is not working or the system is disabled, workers have lost the one final tool they have to protect themselves.”

The multiplying effect of unsafe practices

Often an accident occurs due to a combination of several poor work practices. A Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Fatalgram from 1999 in the USA recounts an event that caused a fatality at a mine when a worker entered an unguarded area alone, near an operating conveyor that was not locked out. The worker’s clothing then became trapped in the conveyor’s operating tail pulley. Four unsafe practices and two unsafe areas combined to produce a catastrophic event. Any individual factor may have led to injury or even death, but the combination essentially sealed the worker’s fate.

In a 2003 study, ConocoPhillips Marine found a correlation between fatalities and unsafe practices. The study showed that for every fatality there are an estimated 300,000 unsafe behaviors.

The research also quantified lost-time accidents, recordable injuries, and near misses. These are independent variables, so the numbers do not mean that Lost Day Incident number 31 will be a fatality. But they do indicate that there is a statistical probability of a fatality for every 30 lost workday incidents. As a result, statistically speaking, an effective way to reduce fatalities is to reduce unsafe behaviors.

“While even one unsafe practice has the statistical potential to lead to serious repercussions, conveyor accidents are rarely the result of a single action,” Marshall concluded. “More often, they result from a combination of company culture and unwise decisions. If workers can eliminate these unsafe practices and minimize their presence in danger zones, their chances of avoiding an accident will improve considerably.”"

The survey, which is the first nationwide poll of safety reps during the pandemic, reveals widespread concerns about the lack of protections, with nearly half of reps warning social distancing is not enforced all of the time and a third reporting a lack of adequate PPE. More than three-quarters of the 2,100 reps surveyed dealt with work Covid cases and almost 60% had seen significant workplace outbreaks.

Yet only a quarter of firms were visited by a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector or environmental health officer during the pandemic, according to the biennial survey. Despite more than 4,500 Covid workplace outbreaks, not a single employer has been prosecuted for breaching Covid regulations during the pandemic.

This comes as many staff are preparing to go back into workplaces under the government’s roadmap out of lockdown. Non-essential businesses including shops, leisure centres and outdoor attractions are due to reopen in April.

England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, warned this month that despite Britain’s impressive vaccination programme, modelling indicates there would be another wave if lockdown were eased too quickly. Even if 90% of the UK’s priority groups are vaccinated, up to one million people are still vulnerable to the disease.

Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, has called on ministers to order the HSE to crack down on bad bosses who risk workers’ safety. “Britain’s safety representatives are sounding the alarm. Too many workplaces are not Covid-secure. If we want to keep people safe, we must stop infections rising again when workplaces reopen,” she said.

The food industry has been one of the worst hit sectors, with figures obtained by the TUC showing there have been 440 outbreaks in food manufacturing and food distribution since April.

New research, due out this week, claims there is a “climate of risk and fear” in workplaces where unions are excluded or sidelined from risk assessments. It found that one in four managers in the food sector are unaware of Covid risk assessments and that half of non-unionised food factories do not have enough PPE.

Professor Sian Moore, from the University of Greenwich, who led the TUC-commissioned research, said: “Our research found a worrying lack of health and safety structures in British workplaces. But we also identified the very real contribution to workplace safety made by union reps during the pandemic.”

There have also been frequent Covid outbreaks in offices, with 687 recorded between April and February. More than 2,000 workers are currently going into the DVLA’s offices in Swansea, where workers have told the union they are receiving “continual notifications to isolate” from the NHS app, even through the outbreak was declared as over in February.

The PCS said the strike would be the biggest so far in the pandemic. Mark Serwotka, the union’s general secretary, accused DVLA management of playing “fast and loose” with the safety of its workers. “That PCS members are prepared to take unprecedented strike action shows just how badly DVLA management have failed in their responsibility to keep staff safe,” he said.

The DVLA said it had introduced a range of safety measures and carried out thousands of lateral flow tests for those on site. It said only 10 staff were isolating following a positive test. “We are continuing to carry out risk assessments and have gone beyond the recommendations set by Welsh government by sending home members of staff on full pay,” said a spokesperson. It added the strike would have a detrimental impact on motorists as restrictions start to ease.

A government spokesperson said: “HSE has acted swiftly to ensure that making workplaces Covid-secure is a priority, carrying out more than 138,000 spot checks – over 90% of businesses checked have the right precautions in place or are willing to make the necessary safety changes without any need for enforcement.”"

A Vancouver coffee shop has created what it is calling a ‘code order’ for anyone to come in and use if they feel unsafe, if they are being stalked or if they need help.

“We get that there’s a lot of anxiety in the world with some of the events that’s happened and mostly this is in response to just relieving some of that anxiety and let people know if you’re in the area and you don’t feel safe, you’re being followed you can pop in,” said Eldric Stuart, owner of Harken Coffee at 338 Powell St. in Vancouver.

He said the code coffee order comes from the fact that sometimes a person can’t always vocalize that they need help.

This comes on the heels of a video that went viral last week of a Vancouver woman saying she was followed closely by a strange man for more than half an hour.

Jamie Coutts filmed much of the encounter that started around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday near Keefer and Columbia streets on the edge of Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside.

Coutts said her stalker didn’t appear fazed by the camera at all.

During the night of 24 February, a member of MSF’s team was killed in the tent in which they lived. Three days later, the child of another staff member died in an accidental fire at a wedding in the camp, in which three staff members were also injured.

“During the night of 24 February, our colleague was off-duty with their family when they were killed,” says Will Turner, MSF emergency manager for Syria. “We are trying to better understand the situation and circumstances around their death. MSF is providing support to the family during this difficult time and we offer our sincerest condolences to our colleague’s family and friends.”

The second incident occurred on the evening of 27 February when a fire broke out in a tent where people were gathered to celebrate a wedding after a child knocked over a diesel heater by accident.

The fire spread to adjoining tents. At least seven people were killed in the blaze, including the four-year-old daughter of an MSF staff member. Around 30 people were injured, including three MSF staff members and several of their family members.

Security and safety situation in AL Hol camp has been unacceptable for the past two years. This year the situation has deteriorated further, with more than 30 killings since January. Most of those killed were targeted by gun violence, with others caught in crossfire, killed in knife attacks or dying in avoidable accidents.

In the second half of January, four gunshot victims, including a mother and child, were received at an MSF clinic in the camp that treats malnourished children, in two separate incidents of gun violence.

As a result of the worsening security situation in Al-Hol, MSF has been forced to temporarily suspend its outreach activities within the camp, including providing medical care within people’s tents and some water and sanitation activities.

The recent tragic incidents demonstrate the human toll of the violence and unsafe living conditions experienced by camp residents. Al-Hol is under the control of local authorities and security forces who prevent most residents from leaving the camp’s perimeters.

“People are being killed with a brutal frequency, often in the tents where they live,” says Turner. “Many of those killed leave behind children who have no one else to take care of them. The authorities have a responsibility to provide people with safety and security at all times. This is not a safe environment and certainly not a suitable place for children to grow up in. This nightmare must stop.”

MSF calls on the international community and countries with citizens in Al-Hol camp to take responsibility to find longer-term solutions for people living there – solutions which must be voluntary and in line with international legal norms, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

The list is long: Funding cuts without the former chief’s insight and a climate that spurred an exodus of officers have hurt the department’s ability to respond to trouble.

Detectives and other specialists are pulling routine patrol shifts to respond to 911 calls rather than working to prevent or investigate crimes because the department is so short-handed. After calling 911, residents throughout the city have had to wait for police response that, in some instances, never happens. The pandemic’s restrictions on gatherings have helped keep some crime down, but police cannot keep up with even a reduced demand for help.

The council is poised to make yet another defunding mistake, even though a federal judge warned of court intervention if public safety is further eroded. On Tuesday, the council’s public safety committee could vote on a proposed $5.4 million reduction to Seattle police for community program spending, sending it to the full council.

Already, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart has warned the council that its actions could put it out of compliance with the 8-year-old federal consent decree. The binding agreement aims to correct what the U.S. Department of Justice found was a pattern of excessive force by Seattle police and evidence of biased policing.

Since 2012, the department has followed that decree’s mandates for specific training and policies, among other reforms. Any cuts that reduce training and supervision resources undermine those years of work.

Council members should better recognize their fundamental duty to keep the city safe each day while building toward its worthy long-term goal of a less police-centric safety system. This means delaying further cuts to the police budget until community resources intended to take over more services are in place and ramped up.

The national protests of 2020 after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police spoke to the real hurt that communities of color have endured from unjust policing. Cities, including Seattle, urgently need to meet these calls to remake public safety. The “defunding” movement to channel police resources into other public services cut $870 million from policing in 25 major American cities, the Guardian found.

To succeed and help cities, this approach needs to be pursued strategically, not rashly. The Seattle City Council has gone the other way, cutting police by $69 million without realistic strategies for the next move. Chief Carmen Best, who was not consulted, quit, rather than lay off younger officers of color she worked to recruit. And 186 officers left the department in 2020 — more than double the expected number.

The consequences are stark. An SPD analysis found the department 158 officers and supervisors short of acceptable minimal staffing needs. On 221 days in 2020, officers in at least one precinct could respond only to high-priority 911 calls. Response times on even those calls shot up. The median response time for theft and alarm calls went from under 12 minutes in April to nearly 18 minutes in December.

Even after interim Police Chief Adrian Diaz described an unworkable “staffing crisis,” the council is foolishly considering more cuts. Committee chair Lisa Herbold and Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda are spearheading this legislation, which would send the city further in a bad direction.

The council cannot plead ignorance. Deputy Mayor Tiffany Washington told the committee March 9 how unrealistic it is to hope Seattle’s current street safety would be helped by shunting more money into community services, no matter how visionary. Council members should reflect on the powerful personal story Washington, a Black woman, told of watching her brother “being thrown down by police and arrested on multiple occasions.” She still has an expectation that police will come help if she calls. This is the real-world perspective that needs to guide policy.

“We will not see significant changes for decades as the community immune system is strengthened,” Washington said. “What this funding will not do is result in instant community safety.”

Until city agencies and other entities can reliably provide the vast array of social services, further hollowing out the police will only add to damage done. That’s not showing sensitivity to hurt communities. That’s creating an unsafe city."

Exposure to ethylene oxide can be unsafe. However, it is commonly used to sterilise medical equipment, including lateral flow tests, and does not pose any danger in this way.

In England, secondary school and college students and staff, and their households, are being asked to regularly take a lateral flow test to check for Covid-19. We’ve seen a large number of posts on social media warning people not to use Covid-19 lateral flow tests, as the swabs are sterilised with ethylene oxide, which can cause cancer. Our readers have also asked us to check these claims.

Ethylene oxide is a colourless gas which is used to sterilise medical equipment around the world and, although overexposure can be dangerous, its use does not make medical products like lateral flow tests unsafe.

It is correct that too much exposure to ethylene oxide can carry health risks, including cancer.

Ethylene oxide for sterilisation

As the posts on social media claim, lateral flow tests are sterilised using ethylene oxide. Sterilisation of medical devices is very important to ensure infections do not spread.

A spokesperson for the DHSC told Full Fact: “Lateral flow tests used in schools have been rigorously tested and are safe to use on a regular basis.

“Any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate and harmful misinformation.”

The DHSC also confirmed that a minimal amount of ethylene oxide is used for sterilisation of the swabs—just 1-2μg (millionths of a gram) per gram.

The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, also confirmed to Full Fact that ethylene oxide is a highly controlled and safe method of sterilisation, which is assessed and evaluated through the sterilisation process to ensure it meets agreed safety standards.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests around half of all sterile medical devices in the US are sterilised with ethylene oxide, including equipment used in general healthcare practices like wound dressings and more specialised equipment like stents (small tubes that can help keep blocked arteries open). The FDA says that, for many medical devices, sterilisation with ethylene oxide may be the only effective method that does not cause any damage to the object being sterilised.

Is ethylene oxide harmful?

Exposure to large amounts of ethylene oxide can have serious health consequences. However, there is no suggestion that using something that has been sterilised by ethylene oxide will be harmful.

Many of the misleading Facebook posts we have seen have quoted from the National Cancer Institute in the US, which sets out the risks from ethylene oxide. Although the health risks set out by the page are genuine, this is not to say that anyone who uses a medical device that has been sterilised with a small amount of ethylene oxide will suffer them.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US says that “acute exposure” can result in irritation and central nervous system depression, while “chronic inhalation” of the gas has been linked to cataracts, cognitive impairment and neurologic dysfunction. It also notes that in some cases, burns in patients have been associated with ethylene oxide residues in implants used in surgical procedures.

Chronic exposure to ethylene oxide has been associated with an increased risk of leukemia, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. As some of the Facebook posts suggest, over exposure to ethylene oxide can alter the DNA in a cell. There has been recent controversy in America over the health concerns of people living near sterilising factories using ethylene oxide.

In the UK, there are exposure limits set by the Health and Safety Executive to protect workers who may interact with the chemical.

Professor Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, told Full Fact that ethylene oxide has been used as a sterilising agent in the medical industry “for decades”.

“When ethylene oxide is used in large quantities, being an alkylating agent, it will cause damage and disrupt DNA and protein in a cell. Indeed that is the basis of its use as a sterilizing agent,” she said.

“However, the sterilization process involves exposing a material to ethylene oxide for a few seconds or minutes, and then removing the gas entirely before the now sterile item is packaged. There is nothing left of the ethylene oxide once it is packaged, and there is no conceivable harm that can come from using an item sterilized in this way.

“Using ethylene oxide is far safer than using, say, bleach, that is much less discriminating in its chemistry and leaves residues that may be undesirable.”"

Failure to properly lockout can exist in many forms – varying from disregarding lockout requirements, to working on a moving conveyor, to improperly stopping the conveyor.
Four unsafe practices and two unsafe areas combined to produce a catastrophic event.
In a 2003 study, ConocoPhillips Marine found a correlation between fatalities and unsafe practices.
If workers can eliminate these unsafe practices and minimise their presence in danger zones, their chances of avoiding an accident will improve considerably.”","work, belt, mining, practices, unsafe, workers, moving, worker, potential, marshall, result, addressing, conveyors, conveyor",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Due to their size, speed and high-horsepower drive motors, conveyors pose a number of risks to personnel working on or near them. In addition to all the physical danger zones, when an injury occurs, ‘fault’ is often attributed to injured workers’ actions or inactions. However, safety experts point out that injuries generally occur due to a series of factors.

“Accidents are typically a result of a complex combination of probabilities, rather than a single unsafe act,” Martin Engineering Process Engineer, Daniel Marshall, observed. “Except for the unsafe act, it can be said that the accident would not have occurred if there was a safer design, better maintenance or less pressure for production.”

Assessing the risk of a conveyor

A thorough risk assessment by trained professionals is the ideal way to bridge the gap between workers and managers when the rules need review, to identify hazards and implement controls to reduce risks.

“A belt conveyor is a powerful machine with thousands of moving parts,” Marshall continued. “These moving components might severely injure a worker and can produce that injury in a fraction of a second.”

A typical conveyor belt moves at a relatively constant speed, commonly running between 0.5-10 m/s. At the very minimum, a worker who inadvertently touches a running conveyor belt – even with world-class reaction time and total focus on the danger of a conveyor – will come in contact with at least one carrying idler, and the potential is there to hit return idlers, chute uprights, stringer supports, pulleys and drives. The results are often disastrous.

Working around a moving conveyor

It has been estimated that two thirds of the fatalities involving conveyor belts take place while the belt is moving, usually because of a worker becoming entangled or crushed by moving equipment. Most of these take place when maintenance or housekeeping is being done on or around an energised conveyor.

These fatalities are generally caused by two compounding practices. The first is performing maintenance without thoroughly locking, tagging, blocking and testing the conveyor. Another unsafe practice is touching a moving conveyor belt with a tool or implement of any kind. When these two choices are combined, the results are usually severe and often fatal. Even working on a conveyor that is turned off, but not locked out, can lead to tragedy.

Workaround and shortcuts

“An intelligent and creative worker will often invent or discover ways to expedite certain functions or make work easier,” Marshall said. “Unfortunately, some of these shortcuts bypass safety hardware and/or best practices, putting the worker in harm’s way.”

The most common of these workarounds involves the “improper locking out” of a conveyor system, Martin Engineering says. The purpose of a lockout is to de-energise all sources of energy, whether latent or active. Failure to properly lockout can exist in many forms – varying from disregarding lockout requirements, to working on a moving conveyor, to improperly stopping the conveyor. An example would be pulling the emergency stop cord and assuming that the conveyor is de-energised.

Another common workaround involves entering a “confined space” without following established procedures. A confined space is any enclosure that is large enough and configured so that an employee can enter and perform assigned work, has limited or restricted means for entry or exit and is not designed for continuous employee occupancy. Very specific rules apply to workers when dealing with confined spaces. Failure to follow those rules can result in increased danger or death, Martin Engineering says.

Other potential unsafe behaviors include crossing a conveyor in a risky manner. Conveyor belts are often lengthy systems bisecting a production facility. Workers may be required to cross a conveyor line to get to an area in need of service or maintenance. To save time, a worker is likely to step over or cross under a conveyor.

“Crossing under” offers multiple hazards, according to the company. If any of the worker’s body parts come in contact with the moving conveyor, it will either act like a grinder and abrade the skin or pull the worker toward rolling components. Crossing under also places the worker at risk from falling objects.

“Crossing over” a conveyor without using a designed and designated crossover structure comes with dangers, as well. There is a high potential for a slip and fall. If lucky, the worker may fall on the ground; if not, the worker will fall onto the conveyor belt. If the conveyor is in operation, the worker may be carried downstream. This can result in contact with the conveyor structure and rolling components or being thrown off the conveyor at the discharge. The safe approach to crossing a conveyor is to use a designated crossover or cross-under point engineered for that purpose, Martin Engineering says.

Anything in a worker’s line of travel is a potential “obstruction”. These can range from piles of spillage, items lying on the walkway or work areas, as well as low overheads. An obstruction can cause several hazards, the most obvious being the opportunity for a trip or fall. If the obstruction is in the middle of the walkway, a worker will have to go around it. If that revised path brings the worker closer to a conveyor, this decision places the worker closer to the hazards of the conveyor.

Neglected safety and control mechanisms

“Emergency stop pull cords are the last line of defence if the belt needs to be stopped quickly in response to an entrapment or impending equipment failure,” Marshall said. “The reaction time when such an event occurs is usually extremely brief, so workers need a way to stop the conveyor as fast as possible. In addition, the belt will not halt immediately and must coast to a stop. If the cord is broken, the switch is not working or the system is disabled, workers have lost the one final tool they have to protect themselves.”

The multiplying effect of unsafe practices

Often an accident occurs due to a combination of several poor work practices. A Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Fatalgram from 1999 in the USA recounts an event that caused a fatality at a mine when a worker entered an unguarded area alone, near an operating conveyor that was not locked out. The worker’s clothing then became trapped in the conveyor’s operating tail pulley. Four unsafe practices and two unsafe areas combined to produce a catastrophic event. Any individual factor may have led to injury or even death, but the combination essentially sealed the worker’s fate.

In a 2003 study, ConocoPhillips Marine found a correlation between fatalities and unsafe practices. The study showed that for every fatality there are an estimated 300,000 unsafe behaviors.

The research also quantified lost-time accidents, recordable injuries, and near misses. These are independent variables, so the numbers do not mean that lost day incident number 31 will be a fatality. But they do indicate that there is a statistical probability of a fatality for every 30 lost workday incidents. As a result, statistically speaking, an effective way to reduce fatalities is to reduce unsafe behaviors.

“While even one unsafe practice has the statistical potential to lead to serious repercussions, conveyor accidents are rarely the result of a single action,” Marshall concluded. “More often, they result from a combination of company culture and unwise decisions. If workers can eliminate these unsafe practices and minimise their presence in danger zones, their chances of avoiding an accident will improve considerably.”"

Under the guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 4 percent of the nation’s schoolchildren live in counties where coronavirus transmission is low enough for full-time, in-person learning without additional restrictions, according to a New York Times analysis of the agency’s latest figures.

In addition to implementing mitigation strategies within schools, the CDC calls for less than 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week as a measure of moderate to low community transmission before children can return to school full-time. The agency acknowledges in-person instruction is a priority, especially considering the disproportionate disadvantage of remote learning on low-income and minority students, and calls for schools to be the first community institutions to reopen. But public health experts believe younger students are likely to have less risk of in-school transmission than older students, suggesting a phased opening.

A map by The New York Times shows where cases are low enough for elementary schools to fully open for both full in-person learning (in several states out west, including Iowa and Nevada) and hybrid learning (in much of the East Coast and Midwest). For middle and high schools, the map shows a majority of the country is still recommended to continue remote learning full-time.

This means it's all the more unlikely that students will be back in school full-time before this summer, although some districts are considering extending the school year due to lost in-class instruction time. Still, some states are disregarding the CDC’s guidelines and reopening against the advice of public health experts. Arkansas, Florida, Iowa and Texas have all ordered all schools to open, although several counties in these states don't meet CDC guidelines.

My heart hurts for the millions of women who feel unsafe and unequal every single day because of men.","feeling, single, dont, normal, women, men, woman, unsafe, shouldnt, feel, violence, life, world",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"By Olivia Martin | Social Media Editor

Every girl knows the universal women’s safety protocol. Don’t walk alone at night. Put your keys between your knuckles in case you need a weapon. Always have pepper spray ready. Wear something bright. Don’t wear anything too scandalous. Tell someone your whereabouts and even call someone if you do end up walking alone. And always be aware of your surroundings, even during the daytime.

For Sarah Everard, this was not enough. Her tragic murder that took place on March 3, 2020, has left women all over the globe feeling angry, heartbroken and desperate for change. I am one of those women, and I am here to say that ending violence against women is not something that can be pushed off any longer. It should not take a horrible situation such as this to cause people to finally be aware of the injustices occurring in our world, and yet time and time again that continues to happen. From the death of George Floyd to the killing of six Asian women last week in Atlanta, it has taken the most extreme and heart-wrenching situations to show people that injustice, inequality and racism are real and happening every single day.

Everard did all the things women are told to do. She was on the phone with her boyfriend while walking home at night from her friend’s house in a well-lit London neighborhood. She was wearing bright clothing, and more than one person knew her whereabouts. And yet, Edwards was abducted and murdered by a 48-year-old cop who was arrested and charged on March 12, 2020. Since this incident took place, there have been protests all over the world of women who are not only infuriated and tired of feeling unsafe, but tired of men not being held accountable for violence against women.

The hashtag #NotAllMen has been trending around the world these past weeks after the death of Everard as some people have felt that the pleas from women for men to take responsibility and take action to do better are too accusatory. Some feel the need to say that “it’s not all men” who do these bad things to women.

However, these arguments are invalid. No woman actually believes that every single man in the entire world is violent or abusive or a harasser of women. Just as the phrase, “All Lives Matter” makes black people unheard and completely misses the point of the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” the phrase “Not All Men” not only makes women feel unheard, but completely takes away from the original outcry of women wanting to feel safer.

Did you know that in the UK 97% of young women have been sexually harassed? In the same study, researchers found that nine out of 10 women in cities around the world feel unsafe in public spaces. This is a global issue. This is affecting every single woman in every single place around the world. And it has taken a murder of a 33-year-old woman who had an entire future and life ahead of her for the world to wake up and realize that it’s not all men, but it is every woman.

Every woman has a story. It doesn’t matter how extreme, every woman has felt unsafe at one point in their life because of a man. I can think of numerous times that I have felt extremely afraid or uncomfortable because of a certain situation where a man made me feel unsafe in public. It happens all the time. Ask one of your female friends if you don’t believe me.

If you are a male, and you are reading this, please educate yourself on ways to help make women feel more safe. There may be things you are doing on accident that you don’t even realize are affecting women around you. Take time to check in with the women in your life and ask them what you can do to make them and other women feel safer. Here is a simple article on ways men can be more conscientious in helping women feel safer.

My heart hurts for all the women in my own life who I know personally have gone through traumatic experiences involving men and harassment. My heart hurts for Everard’s family and friends who loved her dearly. My heart hurts for the millions of women who feel unsafe and unequal every single day because of men. As a society, we need to do better at hearing the cry of those who are hurting, so please hear me out when I say that the violence against women needs to stop.

OutcomesSeveral cases of uterine rupture during pregnancy or childbirth have been described following uterine perforation [24].","perforation, 18, review, risk, abdominal, report, 17, strangulated, womens, health, procedure, unsafe, patient, transvaginal, literature, uterine, case, pregnancy",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Definition, epidemiology, etiology and risk factors

Uterine perforation is a fairly frequent and serious complication of (intrauterine procedure) [17, 18]. It is an uncommon pathology that can be life-threatening as well as compromising a woman’s future fertility [17]. It is defined as a breakdown of the entire full thickness of the uterine wall occurring iatrogenically following a gynecological procedure, usually by a sharp instrument.

The prevalence rate related to the occurrence of uterine perforation is variable depending on the type of intervention performed [17]. Indeed, it is estimated at 5% during the evacuation of retained products of conception for postpartum hemorrhage [17]; 1.6% following a hysteroscopy [19] (more often therapeutic), and at 0.5% after induced or spontaneous termination of pregnancy [14]. Also, partial or complete uterine perforation has been described after the insertion of intrauterine devices [20].

Risk factors have been identified in the literature as predisposing to uterine perforation, we cite uterine anomalies (malposition or anatomical distortion), pregnancy with an increased risk during the second trimester of pregnancy, a uterine scar, even cervical, poor preparation of the uterine cervix before an intrauterine diagnostic or therapeutic procedure and inflammation. However, we identified none of these risk factors in the two cases presented above. Without forgetting procedures carried out by untrained personnel [17, 18]. All these factors contribute to an alteration of the strength of the myometrium wall (body or uterine cervix) which thus becomes conducive to lesions, especially when using a sharp intrauterine instrument [17].

Clinical manifestations and diagnostic

The clinical manifestations are related to the location of the perforation and the time elapsed since the perforation at the moment of diagnosis. Indeed, a perforation seen late is of poor prognosis compared with one diagnosed early [17]. Most uterine perforations are located on the body of the uterus as seen in the first case above. Other perforations occur at the level of the anterior wall (40%), followed by the cervix 36%, and lastly, the fundus in 13% [18] as observed in case number 2 presented above.

Early diagnosis can be made intraoperatively by direct visualization of the opening or a pelvic viscus (intestines,omentum, or ovaries) through the breach [19]. It can be suspected during the procedure by the loss of resistance during the progression of the instrument, or when the latter progresses beyond the fundal length. It can also be suspected based on signs of visceral or vascular damage, including hemorrhage. The latter can be externalized by the vagina, or be intraperitoneal in the abdominal cavity, or manifest as a hematoma of the broad ligament [21]. The bleeding can be significant when the perforation sits laterally on the uterine body or at the level of the cervix. In these cases, it is reasonable to suspect a lesion of the uterine vessels or one of its branches [18]. In the event of internal bleeding following a perforation that went unremarked during the procedure, the patient may present with progressively increasing abdominal pain, fever or even shock [17].

However, the diagnosis of perforation may be later in the postoperative period. The clinical manifestations are often a persistent vaginal hemorrhage, abdominal pain related to a visceral perforation, hematuria or more rarely evisceration of the abdominal contents, notably the small intestine, the sigmoid, the omentum, and the ovary [22]. The protrusion of the small intestine through a reduced uterine opening (tight uterine opening) leads to incarceration of the loop, particularly serious situation given the complications associated with it [23]. From there, 4 clinicopathological forms can be observed, classified by order of severity [23]: obstruction, strangulation, mesenteric detachment (stripping) and small bowel degloving injury. Therefore, the patient will present with signs of acute intestinal obstruction, or even peritonitis as part of a diastatic perforation. Examination of the pelvis shows an exteriorized bowel loop protruding unto the vulva and perineum; the bowel is dilated and difficult to reintroduce [23]. After 6 h, a necrotic appearance of the loop can be observed, as described in case No. 1. In the case of mesenteric stripping, the intestine is exteriorized in the form of a long tube, non-dilated, with no mesentery observed [23].

Management

Treatment of uterine perforation can be conservative or surgical depending on clinical manifestations (bleeding) and the risk of damage to the abdominal viscera [17, 18]. The indications for conservative treatment are: asymptomatic patient and perforation secondary to the use of a blunt instrument without an electrosurgical energy source, such as dilators, curette with no suction and hysteroscope. The conservative treatment of the latter indication consists of the placement of a urinary catheter, antibiotic therapy and monitoring in the hospital for signs of bleeding (abdominal pain, abdominal distention, hematocrite and hemoglobin levels), peritonitis or intestinal obstruction.

Surgical exploration is indicated in case of persistent and severe uterine bleeding, in case of suspicion of visceral or vascular lesions, in case of the use of sharp instruments, of suction and in case of perforation occurring after a termination of pregnancy or retention of conception products [17, 18]. Evisceration through the uterine breach is an absolute indication for surgery. Surgical exploration is done preferably by laparoscopy than by laparotomy. During laparoscopy, careful exploration of the pelvis and abdominal cavity should be performed.

In the case of small perforation, several methods can be used to treat the defect: simple interrupted or continuous suture or use of biological substances. Laparotomy is indicated in case of persistent hemorrhage at laparoscopy despite the hemostatic gesture, a large ligament hematoma or an inadequate technical platform [17]. Regarding transvaginal evisceration associated with uterine perforation, the initial management will consist of resuscitation taking into account the consequences related to occlusion or perforation [23]. In a second step, surgery will allow intestinal resection with anastomosis associated with suturing of the uterine perforation, or even a hysterectomy in the event of significant uterine tearing [23].

Outcomes

Several cases of uterine rupture during pregnancy or childbirth have been described following uterine perforation [24]. However, the cause and effect relationship is not established, especially since these patients had other risk factors for uterine rupture. This risk must be discussed with the patient following management.

Prevention of uterine perforation

The case of safe abortions, prevention measures consist of a preoperative clinical evaluation and preventive measures during gynecological procedures [17, 18]. This preoperative preparation also includes a rigorous clinical evaluation of the patient looking for risk factors for perforation, a correct calculation of gestational age in order to adapt the method of termination of pregnancy and adequate preparation of the uterine cervix [18]. The latter involves progressive dilation using misoprostol, osmotic and/or candle dilators. During the intervention, the additional preventive measures require to position the patient and the uterus adequately and safe use of operative transcervical instruments."

Parents download parental control apps onto a child’s mobile phone, laptop or tablet.
Most parental control apps enable parents to monitor or restrict inappropriate online content from wherever they are.
Boomerang, another popular parental control app, enables parents to set time limits per day, per app.
Parental control apps have also been targeted by attackers due to their insecurities, exposing children’s personal information.","kids, screen, sdks, children, parental, apps, online, protect, parents, cybercrime, unsafe, permissions, control, help, app",Unsafe,idiosyncratic,"Children, like adults, are spending more time online. At home and school pre-schoolers now use an array of apps and platforms to learn, play and be entertained. While there are reported benefits, including learning through exploration, many parents are still concerned about screen time, cybersafety and internet addiction.

An increasingly popular technical solution is parental control apps. These enable parents to monitor, filter and restrict children’s online interactions and experiences. Parental control apps that work by blocking dangerous or explicit content can be marketed as “taking the battle out of screen time” and giving parents “peace of mind”.

But such a quick fix is inadequate when addressing the complicated reasons behind screen time. Much worse though, the apps expose users to privacy and other safety issues most people aren’t aware of.

What apps do parents use?

Research by Australia’s eSafety Commission shows 4% of preschoolers’ parents use parental control apps. This increases to 7% of parents with older children and 8% of parents with teenagers. Global trends suggest these figures are bound to rise.

Parents download parental control apps onto a child’s mobile phone, laptop or tablet. Most parental control apps enable parents to monitor or restrict inappropriate online content from wherever they are. They provide parents with insights into which sites their child has visited and for how long, as well as who they have interacted with.

Qustudio, for example, claims to keep children “safer from cyber threats” by filtering inappropriate content, setting time limits on use and even monitoring text messages.

Boomerang, another popular parental control app, enables parents to set time limits per day, per app.

Why they may not be safe

Parental control apps need many permissions to access particular systems and functions on devices. 80% of parental control apps request access to location, contacts and storage.

While these permissions help the apps carry out detailed monitoring, some of them may not be necessary for the app to function as described. For instance, several apps designed to monitor children’s online activity ask for permissions such as “read calendar”, “read contacts” and “record audio” — none of which are justified in the app description or the privacy policy.

Read more: 83% of Australians want tougher privacy laws. Now’s your chance to tell the government what you want

Many are considered “dangerous permissions”, which means they are used to access information that could affect the user’s privacy and make their device more vulnerable to attack.

For example, Boomerang requests more than 91 permissions, 16 of which are considered “dangerous”. The permission “access fine location” for instance, allows the app to access the precise geographic location of the user. The “read phone state” allows the app to know your phone number, network information and status of outgoing calls.

It’s not just the apps that get that information. Many of these apps embed data hungry third-party software development kits (SDKs). SDKs are a set of software tools and programs used by developers to save them from tedious coding. However, some SDKs can make the app developers money from collecting personally identifiable information, such as name, location and contacts from children and parents.

Because third-party SDKs are developed by a company separate from the original app, they have different protocols around data sharing and privacy. Yet any permissions sought by the host app are also inherited by third-party SDKs.

The Google Play Store, which is used for Android phones, does not force developers to explain to users whether it has embedded third-party SDKs, so users cannot make an informed decision when they consent to the terms and conditions.

Read more: Children can be exposed to sexual predators online, so how can parents teach them to be safe?

Apple’s App Store is more transparent. Developers must state if their apps use third-party code and whether the information collected is used to track them or is linked to their identity or device. Apple has removed a number of parental control apps from the App Store due to their invasive features.

Many popular parental control apps in the Google Play Store have extensive security and privacy vulnerabilities due to SDKs. For example, SDKs for Google Ads, Google Firebase and Google Analytics are present in over 50% of parental control apps in the Google Play Store, while the Facebook SDK is present in 43%.

A US study focusing on whether parental control apps complied with laws to protect the personal data of children under 13 found roughly 57% of these apps were in violation of the law.

Not all parental control apps request dangerous permissions. The Safer Kid app, for example, does not request any dangerous permissions but costs US$200 per year.

Why should I worry?

Personal data has become a valuable commodity in the digital economy. Huge volumes of data are generated from our digital engagements and traded by data brokers (who collect information about users to sell to other companies and/or individuals) and tech companies.

The value is not in a singular data point, but the creation of huge datasets that can be processed to make predictions about individual behaviours. While this is a problem for all users, it is particularly problematic for children. Children are thought to be more vulnerable to online threats and persuasion than adults due to more limited digital skills and less awareness of online risks.

Read more: Kids need to learn about cybersecurity, but teachers only have so much time in the day

Data-driven advertising establishes habits and taste preferences in young children, positioning them as consumers by exploiting insecurities and using peer influence.

Parental control apps have also been targeted by attackers due to their insecurities, exposing children’s personal information.

There are better ways to reduce screen time

It is also questionable whether parental control apps are worthwhile. Research suggests issues of screen time and cybercrime are best managed through helping children self-regulate and reflect on their online behaviour.

Rather than policing time limits for screen use, parents could focus on the content, context and connections their child is making. Parents could encourage their children to talk to them about what happens online, to help make them more aware of risk and what to do about it.

Read more: Stop worrying about screen 'time'. It's your child’s screen experience that matters

Restrictive approaches also reduce opportunities for kids’ growth and beneficial online activity. Unsurprisingly, children report parental control apps are overly invasive, negatively impacting their relationships with parents.

Instead of a technical “quick-fix,” we need an educational response that is ethical, sustainable and builds young people’s digital agency. Children will not be under their parents’ surveillance forever, so we need to help them prepare for online challenges and risks."

It prompted many women to share their own stories of feeling constrained in moving around in their local area. CCTV footage of Everard before she vanished was a reminder for many women and a wake up call for many men.

And indeed, data shows that 32% of women in the UK feel unsafe or very unsafe when walking alone in their local area at night. Meanwhile, only 13% of men expressed the same concern.

There have been hundreds of personal stories from women on social media discussing how they are constrained by safety concerns when walking around after dark. These have been particularly resonant while much of Europe is living under various states of lockdown. For many people, getting out of the home whenever possible has become an important coping mechanism. During the winter months, and especially for people working full time from home, that often necessarily means going out when it’s dark – or not at all.

Data from the European Social Survey shows just how different the experiences of men and women are when it comes to the fundamental freedom of being able to walk alone at night. In all 29 countries included in the ESS, men reported feeling safer than women while walking alone in their local area after dark. It’s a question we’ve been asking every two years since 2002/03. Assessing our most recent data (2018/19), we find significant differences between men and women.

In Bulgaria, a staggering 62% of female respondents feel unsafe or very unsafe. The figure in Bulgaria is also the highest in Europe for male respondents, 38% of whom said they would not feel safe – but most men there still report feeling safer than women by a substantial margin.

In Germany 37% of women felt unsafe and in Italy 36%. In Lithuania and France, 34% of women felt unsafe and in Latvia 33%. For Spain and Ireland the figure was 31%.

In contrast, the proportion of male respondents who felt unsafe was only 13% in Germany, 12% in Spain and Ireland, 11% in France and 10% in Latvia.

Even in relatively safe countries such as Denmark, Finland and Iceland, the gender divide remains. Men are are still five times less likely than women to report being fearful at night walking in their local area.

In a group of five other countries – Slovenia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway – women are four times more likely to feel unsafe than men.

Progress?

We can see by looking back at the data from 2002/03 – when we first ran our survey – that some progress has been made. Back then, 52% of female respondents in the UK reported feeling unsafe after dark, compared to about a third (32%) 18 years later.

EPA

But while this is a significant and welcome improvement, overall gender differences stubbornly persist. The figure dropped for men over the same period, from 20% to 13% feeling unsafe, meaning British men were 2.6 times more likely to feel safe than women in 2002/03 and 2.5 times in 2018/19. So, it seems everyone feels safer overall but gender differences remain.

This trend is similar across Europe: overall feelings of safety have generally improved for both genders but women remain between 2.5 and 5.7 times more likely to feel unsafe than men in almost all countries.

Norway provides an example of a country where the gender gap on this issue has significantly narrowed over time. In 2002/03, 23% of female respondents and 3% of men reported feeling unsafe or very unsafe walking in their local area after dark. In 2018/19, this had dropped to 13% of female respondents with the male figure basically unchanged (2%).

Perhaps policymakers, the police and communities might look to countries such as Norway for inspiration on how to work towards making women feel just as safe as men in their local area."

A survey conducted in two districts of Punjab reveals that both poor and well-off sections of society use solid biomass for various reasons, and women suffer from various health problems due to the inhalation of smoke released from the burning of these fuels. Policies need to be put in place to ensure the affordability of clean fuels, and people should be made aware of the adverse effects of this practice on health and the environment.

Through targeted subsidy schemes regarding clean fuel, India has laid the ground for affordable, secure and clean energy during the last five years. Despite arduous efforts of the ruling government, rural regions of India are still in the grip of dangerous cooking. In 2011–12, the National Sample Survey Office’s 68th round disclosed that more than 66% of the households in rural India relied on firewood and cow dung cakes to fulfill their cooking fuel needs. Since the passage of time, the figures remain rigid, as reported by National Family Health Survey (NFHS) (IIPS 2015–16). Besides this, the picture of usage of solid biomass in rural Punjab is outrageous. As per the NFHS report of 2015–16 (IIPS 2015–16), 75.2% households in rural Punjab depend on traditional biomass. Ironically, 99% use traditional cook stoves (open chulha), and this is a direct indicator of the limited access to cleaner energy options.

The government has made prominent efforts to provide liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to 7.7 crore households across India through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) (Patnaik et al 2019). Moreover, it also states that 94% of the households now have an LPG connection. Yet, the ground reality is different from above stated figures, especially in Punjab. Despite knowing the socio-economic cost of burning cow dung cakes, households persistently use solid biomass due to financial and other constraints, as well as certain illogical beliefs. Moreover, the inefficient combustion of cow dung cakes in open space produces umpteen number of toxic pollutants, like fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide, which ultimately add to the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and household air pollution (HAP)."

Manufacturers must embrace digital culture for safe human-robot working.

When Robots are Unsafe

“Safety is not a gadget but a state of mind,” said the safety expert Eleanor Everet. Industrial robots are used to separate workers from dangerous tasks—but what do we do when robots are the problem? Here, Claudia Jarret, US country manager at EU Automation, explains why a culture shift is needed if manufacturers are to guarantee safety in their robots.



Robots have long been used to separate human workers from dull, dangerous or dirty tasks in factories and warehouses—that’s nothing new. Considering that 888,220 instances of non-fatal injury or illness caused private workers in United States to miss at least one day of work in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there’s always a requirement for better workplace safety.



But, what about instances where robots are the unsafe problem? Forbes highlights the widely-reported 2016 incident where a semi-autonomous driving Tesla car collided with a tractor-trailer in Florida, killing its driver. But it also highlights lesser-known example, such when an industrial robot killed a German factory employee in 2015 and another killed a Michigan worker in 2017.



Concerns of robots injuring their human colleagues will become a more pressing issue as the continuing COVID-19 pandemic accelerates the adoption of automation in the workplace, to support social distancing and fewer workers on the shop floor. In The Future of Jobs Report, more than 80 per cent of business executives said they are accelerating plans to digitize work processes and deploy new technologies. 50 per cent of employers are expecting to accelerate the automation of some roles in their companies.



Who’s responsible?

Robots can’t be blamed for the accidents they cause, of course. Accidents must be attributed to the people behind the machines—to human error, miscalculations or programming errors. That’s why initiatives are needed to prepare the workforce for automation, and to operate robots both effectively and safely.



Reskilling employees will be crucial to embracing automation. In fact, the McKinsey Global Institute report, Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, estimates that as many as 375 million workers—or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce—may need to reskill in digitization, automation and artificial intelligence by 2030. According to some, bringing workers into the automation fold will be the biggest challenge since the large-scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing in North America and Europe, during the early 20th century.



Having the skills

It’s true that making sure workers have the right skills to deal with robots, and automation in general, won’t be easy, and different companies are approaching this in different ways. Upskilling workers seems to be the most popular course—one example is Amazon’s ‘Upskilling 2025’ initiative, an announcement that it plans to spend $700 million dollars to retrain a third of its workforce with skills for automation.



Other companies have further to go. 52 per cent of industrial workers interviewed in the Digital Factories 2020: Shaping the future of manufacturing report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) believed their company lacks a true digital culture.



“Culture” is the keyword here. In order for any upskilling program to be truly effective, employers must give workers a seat at the table. Automation will create, as well as reduce, opportunities for employees of varying skill levels. It will require higher levels of skill from some workers, while reducing the levels of skill needed from others.



Therefore, companies must invest in and train their staff to get the most from the latest human machine interfaces (HMIs) for robots, along with SCADA and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems—wherever they fall on the skills ladder.



A better digital culture means winning employees’ confidence. PwC’s Digital Factories 2020 report puts it best: “It is absolutely vital to include employees at all stages of developing and introducing new technologies.” The report suggests that workers be involved in evaluating possible robotic technologies; testing and rolling out the technologies in pilot projects; and finally rolling them out in production. The buy-in of employees can be earned through these steps.



Safe in the knowledge

Which brings us back to safety. Getting workers involved, and trained, with technologies at the earliest stages can double-up with effective risk assessment and understanding potential safety hazards. Safety and training can go hand-in-hand by ensuring each worker is trained to follow the safety protocol and avoid risks of on-site accidents and injuries—whatever their skill level.



Training in the safe use of robots also goes beyond the technologies’ installation. As the national safety guidelines for the manufacturing industry are always changing, periodic training must be delivered to workers to ensure they can operate the machinery safely.



Safety of robots must also be guaranteed over the long-term. One way to achieve this is being explored by MIT in collaboration with the automobile manufacturer BMW, by using simulations to develop algorithms that help robots predict and respond to humans in close proximity, such as on a car production line.



And, as well as the humans, let’s not forget the robots themselves. Effective maintenance is absolutely integral to the safe operation of robots. This is where the support of an automation parts supplier like EU Automation is vital for ensuring the right robot parts are sourced and delivered globally, on-time—even during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.



Not only can robots have a positive impact on the workplace, they can also separate their human work colleagues from injurious tasks—but manufacturers must reskill their workforces accordingly. As Everet said, “Safety is not a gadget, but a state of mind.”

The 23-year-old student started dating the Call Me By Your Name star last September but broke things off with the 34-year-old actor when he started making rules for her.

She recalled to Vanity Fair magazine: He started making rules for me of things I could and couldn’t do, who I could have over, who I couldn’t. He told me that I couldn’t have anyone else in my bed.

And then I just started to feel really unsafe and really sick to my stomach about things.

“I was also emotionally dependent on him.”

Paige decided to end their relationship over text because she was worried about Armie's unpredictability.

She said: You never know what you’re going to get with him — he’s kind of a scary person.”

Alarm bells had rung for Paige shortly after she met the Rebecca actor and he quickly confided in her some dark family secrets.

She said: “A lot of really dark stuff. I felt confused why he was telling me this stuff so instantly... It was stuff I would never share off the bat...

He said his grandfather was this kind of very scary person who had these crazy sex parties where there would be guns.

“He thought it was cool and was proud of him in a way.”

During their time together, Paige claimed she had to pay for everything because Armie didn't have any money and was getting by on loans from friends.

Another of Armie's former girlfriends, Courtney Vucekovich, also spoke to the publication about her three-month romance with the Lone Ranger star, who she bonded with over past trauma .

Courtney, 30, said he initially made her feel like the only girl in the world but she was left uncomfortable following one sexual encounter where the actor allegedly persuaded her into a bondage scenario that [she] was not comfortable with.

Courtney said she eventually consented and really regretted doing so , and after they split last September, she checked herself into a treatment programme for trauma.

Andrew Brettler, Armie's lawyer, insisted everything between the Man From U.N.C.L.E. star — who has children Harper, six, and Ford, four, with estranged wife Elizabeth Chambers — and his former partners was consensual .

He told Vanity Fair in a statement: All interactions between Mr. Hammer and his former partners were consensual. They were fully discussed, agreed upon in advance with his partners, and mutually participatory.

The stories perpetuated on social media were designed to be salacious in an effort to harm Mr. Hammer, but that does not make them true.

An Instagram account called House of Effie first sparked reports about Armie's alleged sexual behaviour when they posted a series of unverified direct messages allegedly from the actor, which referenced cannibalistic fantasies.

Following the scandal, Armie left his upcoming film Shotgun Wedding — which also stars Jennifer Lopez — because he didn't want to be away from his children amid the vicious and spurious online attacks .

He said: I’m not responding to these bulls*** claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for 4 months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic. Lionsgate is supporting me in this, and I’m grateful to them for that.” — BANG

Leonie Hayden reports.

A landmark survey of contemporary Māori art, Toi Tū Toi Ora, opened at the Auckland Art Gallery late last year to a wave of critical and popular acclaim. In stark contrast to the plaudits for the exhibition, however, the institution has been plagued by internal ructions leading up to and since its launch. Concerns around gallery leadership and cultural safety have culminated in the suspension of an employee accused of leaking a recording of a heated all-staff meeting, the resignations of 11 staff, half the gallery’s Māori advisory board standing down and a lengthy complaint submitted via the staff union.

The unrest follows the departure of the gallery’s curator Māori, Nigel Borell (Pirirākau, Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Ranginui, Te Whakatōhea) soon after the opening of the exhibition.

More than 800 people attended the Toi Tū Toi Ora opening night event on December 4, which saw a who’s who of Māori arts practitioners, media personalities and community leaders filling the central Auckland gallery. While arts patrons and gallery supporters celebrated the launch, disquiet simmered underneath. News of Borell’s resignation had not yet been made public, but many of his supporters, including artists featured in the exhibition, wore badges that read “NB” in large type; and, beneath, “Not today coloniser”, a message of solidarity with the curator.

Borell announced his resignation in an interview with NZ Herald’s Canvas magazine in January, citing irreconcilable differences with the gallery’s director, Kirsten Lacy, with whom he had worked closely on Toi Tū Toi Ora. He told Canvas that he and Lacy, who arrived from Australia having previously worked as the deputy director at the National Art Gallery, had “different ways of viewing aspirations for Māori”.

Artist Elizabeth Ellis, the former chair of the gallery’s Māori advisory board Haerewa, and a foundation member since its creation in 1994, also announced her resignation in November. In the same story, she told the Herald it wasn’t a “protest” resignation. Since, however, four more foundation members have resigned.

In a letter provided to The Spinoff, dated February 18, sent on behalf of Ellis, Dr Benjamin Pittman, Mere Harrison Lodge, Fred Graham and Dr Patu Hohepa, the group states: “We have valued our time guiding and supporting the curator Māori and wider gallery, ensuring it is a culturally safe place for all. However, changes over the past two years at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki have set a different vision for Māori.” The letter is addressed to Lacy, who took up the role of director in May 2019.

In response to questions from the Spinoff, Lacy said via email this was “not a total surprise” as “some of the members had indicated they were going to retire once they had achieved a long-held aspiration of exhibiting Toi Tu Toi Ora”.

She added that the gallery is undertaking “structural changes” which included a discussion about Haerewa extending its memberships to include mana whenua voices. “This has not occurred but this may have been seen as a change of direction for some Haerewa members.”

A former board member spoken to by The Spinoff says that membership has never been closed to mana whenua – Ngāti Whātua carver Bernard Makoare was a member of Haerewa for six years – but that the board is primarily for arts experts whose main role is to support the curator Māori. The former member said Auckland Council recognises 19 iwi with mana whenua interests in Auckland, and a 10-person board cannot give representation to all on mana whenua status alone.

Lacy said the resignations could be attributed to “a mix of retirement, new employment opportunities, study leave and leaving the region”.

On Borell’s resignation, she said: “Nigel has spoken for himself publicly and to many in the community on the reasons for his resignation and there is nothing additional that I can add to his comments. It was his decision and choice to make, and, as I said at his farewell, I wish nothing but the very best for him in his next endeavours.”

She said a new curator Māori will be appointed “in the coming weeks”.

Multiple sources have told The Spinoff the breakdown of the relationship between Lacy and Borell was in part a result of decisions on the leadership of the discussion series to accompany Toi Tū Toi Ora.

The Auckland Art Gallery website shows a cancelled October 28 event was a conversation with three Māori artists, to be hosted by Lacy.

The cancelled Toi Talks event.

In response, Lacy said that Borell was “consulted on a specific public programme to be delivered in October over a number of meetings. When he advised me that he disagreed with the tenets of the programme and the inclusion of a series of Māori guests being included, I cancelled the programme and it was not delivered.”

The staff meeting

A recording of an all-staff meeting that took place on January 18 has been the subject of an employment “misconduct” investigation, leading to the suspension of a Māori employee who worked as a security guard.

The staff member was stood down for a number of weeks under suspicion of circulating the recording and for tweeting in support of Borell’s exit and his interview in Canvas. They attended the January 18 meeting in person, but say there is no evidence that they made the recording or circulated it.

The 40-minute recording features opening remarks from Lacy and Helen Te Hira, the general manager kaupapa Māori for Auckland Unlimited – Auckland Council’s economic and cultural agency, a recent merger of ATEED and Regional Facilities Auckland, which oversees the Auckland Art Gallery. In it, Lacy addresses negative press received by the gallery and herself. She references a number of new Māori roles and initiatives at the gallery and talks about her relationship with Ngāti Whātua and other Māori arts experts, but makes no mention of Haerewa or Borell. Te Hira acknowledges both in her remarks, and gives mihi to the kaiārahi Māori working within the gallery.

A number of gallery staff are then heard voicing their concerns about racism and cultural safety at the gallery, and a lack of transparency around five recent staff redundancies, which included people of colour. Some of the speakers are audibly distressed and in tears. The final comments come from a staff member asking the gallery’s leadership to take responsibility for the events leading to Borell’s resignation, and not to gloss over it by talking about the future.

Union action

The Auckland Art Gallery’s union, the PSA, has issued a member submission to Auckland Unlimited on behalf of more than 50 Auckland Art Gallery employees. Staff received an acknowledgement of receipt on March 17.

In the submission, a copy of which has been seen by The Spinoff, staff union members say the “most significant” issue is “lack of competency in leadership and an ongoing lack of trust between gallery leadership and gallery staff”.

They argue that other avenues taken to raise these issues have “not resulted in any meaningful outcomes”. The submission says a lack of senior staff who “live and lead from a place of te ao Māori” makes the gallery an “unsafe space for Māori” and the existing cultural framework, including the longstanding relationship with Haerewa, has been undermined; bullying is “rife” in the workplace, they say; staff fear they will be in the “firing line” if they raise issues; and positions previously held by “ethnic minority staff” have been downgraded to much lower salary scales.

The staff behind the submission say Lacy’s approach is “at odds with the rest of the staff” and her leadership style is “autocratic”. They claim she “regularly misses team meetings and then dismisses group recommendations that are agreed in the meetings”. Concerns are raised around the appointment of external contractors, too. “Decision-making on programmes, acquisitions and expenditure, including investment made in personal projects and multiple external consultants, is done without [the] transparency expected of a public institution,” reads the submission.

One staff member currently working at the Auckland Art Gallery told The Spinoff the mood at the gallery right was close to “mutinous”.

“In the hui that I’ve been in, 100% of union members have supported the submission, and in fact there’s probably even more staff that aren’t unionised who would side with the submission too,” they said.

Lacy’s video series Cultured Conversations, in which she interviews arts and arts-adjacent subjects, also comes under fire. “It does not appear to serve the gallery beyond providing networking opportunities for the director,” reads the submission. It claims that staff are not consulted on guests, nor are relevant staff invited to meet and engage with guests, such as Māori staff welcoming Māori guests.

Lacy defended the Cultured Conversations exercise, saying it was a “director-led programme amongst some 3,000 public programmes and events” and it has been a “very effective programme in raising the profile of the importance of the arts and culture to Tamaki”. She said she has invited Māori cultural leaders to meet with staff at staff meetings, and five guests have presented to staff over the past few months.

Since the recorded meeting in January, smaller departmental meetings have been held to discuss the issues that were raised. The PSA submission claims that the issues around Borell’s departure have not been properly addressed, and staff have been made to feel they cannot discuss it in the workplace. Lacy disputes the point. She told The Spinoff that Auckland Art Gallery and Auckland Unlimited are currently engaging with the union to understand the issues being raised, and “how current they are”.

“Like many other organisations experiencing the impact of Covid, the gallery staff and programme have also been impacted. I have been very concerned for the wellbeing of my staff over the past year.”

One staff member told The Spinoff that the experience was “disempowering”, saying: “It’s a hard place to work, not because of the work itself, but because of the unacknowledged historical trauma. There seems to be a lack of will to actually look at what is. Instead you just get ‘that’s not going to happen again’. Well it has happened, and no one’s talking about it.

“The thing that blows my mind is that it feels like she’s being protected at the expense of the gallery. That’s blowing the minds of the people who have committed their entire lives to the place.”

The PSA document also details a range of concerns that pre-date Borrell’s resignation. Workloads are described as “exhausting” and “relentless” as a result of understaffing, and staff say they are concerned the high workload will continue throughout 2021.

“Everyone passionately believes in what they’re doing,” the staff member said, “and people are so committed to their colleagues, but there’s no real infrastructure of support for the actual people who make up the gallery.

“The best bit about the gallery is the staff. That’s why people turn up every day.”

When approached by The Spinoff, Borell wouldn’t be drawn further on his reasons for leaving, or the ongoing issues between gallery staff and leadership. Instead he paid tribute to the staff and the artists who contributed to Toi Tū Toi Ora, saying “it’s about Māori being at the centre of their own story”.

“This in itself is an act of tino rangatiratanga: of sovereignty as guaranteed under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. These current actions are a powerful reminder of why that is important.”"
