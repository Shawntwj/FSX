A Dutch court has ordered the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell to pay compensation over oil spills in Nigeria’s Niger Delta, a ruling which could pave the way for more cases against multinational oil firms.

The Court of Appeal in The Hague on Friday ruled that the Nigerian arm of the British-Dutch company must issue payouts over a long-running civil case involving four Nigerian farmers who were seeking compensation, and a clean-up, from the company over pollution caused by leaking oil pipelines.

It held Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary liable for two leaks that spewed oil over an area of a total of about 60 football pitches in two villages, saying that it could not be established “beyond a reasonable doubt” that saboteurs were to blame.

The Hague appeals court ruled that sabotage was to blame for an oil leak in another village.

However, it said that the issue of whether Shell can be held liable “remains open” and the case will be continued as the court wants clarification about the extent of the pollution and whether it still has to be cleaned up.

Under Nigerian law, which was applied in the Dutch civil case, the company is not liable if the leaks were the result of sabotage.

“Shell Nigeria is sentenced to compensate farmers for damages,” the court said in its ruling, which can be appealed via the Dutch Supreme Court.





The amount of compensation will be established at a later date. The court did not specify how many of the four farmers would receive compensation.

The court did not hold Shell’s parent company, which is based in the Netherlands, directly responsible.

However, it ruled that Shell’s parent company and its Nigerian subsidiary must fit a leak-detection system to a pipeline that caused one of the spills.

Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris, reporting from the Nigerian capital, Abuja, said the verdict would be greeted with “relief and joy” by farmers in Nigeria and could “open the floodgates” for many other similar cases.

“Hundreds of people have queued up to sue shell for contaminating the Niger Delta,” Idris said, citing cases brought against Shell in the UK and the Netherlands.

“I spoke to an activist a short while ago who said, ‘This is just the beginning’, and a lot of analysts also believe [the ruling] will open the floodgates to so many litigations against oil production companies that have been operating in Nigeria.”

‘Tears of joy’

The case was initiated in 2008 by the farmers and the Friends of the Earth campaign group, who were seeking reparations for lost income from contaminated land and waterways in the Niger Delta region, the heart of the Nigerian oil industry.

The spills concerned were between 2004 and 2007, but pollution from leaking oil pipelines remains a big problem in the Niger Delta.

“Tears of joy here. After 13 years, we’ve won,” the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth tweeted following Friday’s ruling.

Donald Pols, head of the NGO’s Dutch branch, described the court’s decision as “fantastic news for the environment and people living in developing countries”.

“It means people in developing countries can take on the multinationals who do them harm,” he said.

Shell argued that saboteurs were responsible for leaks in underground oil pipes that have polluted the delta. The company also argued that it should not be held legally responsible in the Netherlands for the actions of a foreign subsidiary, meaning Shell Nigeria.

After the ruling, Shell said it continues to believe the spills were caused by sabotage, adding it was dismayed that its Nigerian subsidy – the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) – was judged to be culpable.

“We are … disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that SPDC is liable,” the company said in a statement.

The Nigerian subsidiary added: “Like all Shell-operated ventures globally, we are committed to operating safely and protecting the local environment.”

Shell discovered and started exploiting Nigeria’s vast oil reserves in the late 1950s and has faced heavy criticism from activists and local communities overspills and for the company’s close ties to government security forces.

Friends of the Earth, which has supported the Nigerian farmers in their legal battle, argues that leaking pipes are caused by poor maintenance and inadequate security and that Shell does not do enough to clean up spills."

A Dutch court has delivered a major victory to a group of Nigerian farmers in their 13-year-long effort to hold Shell's Nigerian subsidiary accountable for oil spills on their lands.

The Court of Appeal in The Hague sided with farmers and environmentalists on most of their legal claims, ruling that the Nigerian subsidiary owes the farmers financial compensation for the oil spill pollution in two villages.

""The court ruled that Shell Nigeria is liable for the damage caused by the spills. Shell Nigeria is sentenced to compensate farmers for damages,"" Senior Justice Sierd Schaafsma said, as reported by Agence France-Presse.

The parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, and its subsidiary must also install a leak detection system to one pipeline to prevent further spills.

The court is still considering whether to hold Shell responsible for spillage in a third village, which was caused by sabotage. The spills happened between 2004 and 2007.

""Finally, there is some justice for the Nigerian people suffering the consequences of Shell's oil,"" Eric Dooh, one of the Nigerian plaintiffs, said in a statement after the verdict. His father was also a plaintiff but died before the case wrapped up.

""Three of the four Nigerian plaintiffs and their fellow villagers must now be compensated for the damage caused and Shell must ensure that there is a leakage detection system in the pipelines in Nigeria,"" Friends of the Earth, the environmental organization that sued Shell, said in a statement. ""It is the first time that a court has held Dutch transnational corporation accountable for its duty of care abroad.""

The court has not yet set the amount of compensation the farmers will receive, and the verdict can be appealed to a higher court.

The plaintiffs said the spills were caused by the company's negligence.

Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd., maintains that spills were caused by sabotage, which could reduce its liability. But the appeals court ruled that Shell has not proved that claim ""beyond reasonable doubt.""

""We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that SPDC is liable,"" a spokesperson for the company told NPR. ""Sabotage, crude oil theft and illegal refining are a major challenge in the Niger Delta.""

In a previous ruling in 2013, a lower Dutch court took a narrower view of the case. As The Associated Press reported, it said the Nigerian subsidiary should compensate just one of the farmers, and found that the Dutch company could not be held liable. In 2015, after appeals from both sides, judges ruled that Shell could be held liable for the pollution in Dutch courts.

Shell is facing another major legal challenge in The Netherlands, in a case also brought by environmentalists including Friends of the Earth Netherlands. The plaintiffs want Shell to be forced to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. As NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported, the lawsuit ""could have implications for future cases and the role of companies in meeting climate targets."""

A Dutch court on Friday ordered Shell to pay compensation in a long-running case brought by four Nigerian farmers who accuse the oil giant of causing widespread pollution.

After 13 years of legal wrangling, an appeals court in The Hague ruled that Shell's Nigerian branch must pay out for oil spills on land in two villages.

It also held the Anglo-Dutch parent company Royal Dutch Shell liable for installing new pipeline equipment to prevent further devastating spills in the Niger Delta region.

The case, backed by the Netherlands arm of environment group Friends of the Earth, has dragged on so long that two of the Nigerian farmers have died since it was first filed in 2008.

""The court ruled that Shell Nigeria is liable for the damage caused by the spills. Shell Nigeria is sentenced to compensate farmers for damages,"" judge Sierd Schaafsma said.

The amount of damages would be determined later, the court said. It did not specify how many of the four farmers would receive compensation.

The farmers first sued Shell in 2008 over pollution in their villages Goi, Oruma and Ikot Ada Udo, in southeastern Nigeria.

A lower court in the Netherlands found in 2013 that Shell should pay compensation for one leak but that Shell's parent company could not be held liable in a Dutch court for the actions of its Nigerian subsidiary.

But in 2015 the Hague appeals court ruled that Dutch courts did indeed have jurisdiction in the case.

- 'Environmental damage' -

On Friday, the court ruled that Shell Nigeria must pay compensation for the leaks at Goi and Oruma.

""In the Uruma cases, Shell Nigeria and... Royal Dutch Shell are ordered to equip the pipeline with a leak detection system so that environmental damage can be limited in the future,"" the court said.

Shell Nigeria should have shut down oil supplies on the day of the spill in the cases in Goi, it said.

The court said it needed more time to resolve the case of Ikot Ada Udo, saying that the leak was due to sabotage but it was not clear whether Shell could still be held liable for it, and for cleaning up.

""For the inhabitants of the Niger Delta it is crucial that their land is cleaned up and their lost crops and livelihoods are compensated by the guilty party: Shell,"" Donald Pols of Friends of the Earth Netherlands said in a statement ahead of the case.

Shell has always blamed all of the spills on sabotage and said it has cleaned up with due care where pollution has occurred.

At a hearing last year lawyers for the farmers showed gushing and burning oil spills as well as villagers dragging their hands through water sources, their hands streaked with the substance afterwards.

Nigeria was the world's ninth-largest oil producer in 2018, pumping out volumes valued at some $43.6 billion (37 billion euros), or 3.8 percent of total global production.

In a separate case in the Netherlands, the widows of four Nigerian activists executed by the military regime in the 1990s have accused Shell of complicity in their deaths.

Shell also faces a landmark legal bid to force it to meet emissions targets in the Paris climate accords, brought by several environmental groups in the Netherlands led by Friends of the Earth in 2019.

Members of the Ejama-Ebubu community and law enforcement officers entered a FirstBank branch in Port Harcourt on Tuesday to seize assets following a court award relating to the spill that took place in the 1967-70 civil war.

The community was awarded damages worth 17 billion naira ($44.7 million), with accruing interest, in a federal court ruling in 2010. Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) has long challenged the award. The community says the value with interest is now more than 180 billion naira.

Shell, the pioneer of Nigeria's oil industry in the 1950s, has for years battled to deal with oil spills, theft and unrest in the Niger Delta, the industry's heartland in the south.

FirstBank, which signed an agreement in 2012 to act as guarantor for SPDC, said the action by the community to enter its branch was ""unjustified, illegal and a reckless misuse of the machinery of justice/the state for an unlawful purpose.""

In November, Nigeria's Supreme Court denied SPDC's application seeking to appeal the 2010 decision.

But SPDC said the Supreme Court's ruling did not determine liability or decide the size of the award. It said it had an injunction preventing enforcement while the size was in dispute, adding ""any attempt to enforce payment should not be permitted.""

SPDC is 55% owned by state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and 30% by Shell. Other firms own the rest.

Asido Emmanuel, a lawyer for the community, said Tuesday's action was a ""lawful execution of the Supreme Court judgement"" and said it was conducted with a writ of attachment, an order that allows seizure of property.

He said law enforcement officers were present and said those involved took ""a long inventory of items"" from the bank branch, without giving details.

FirstBank said ""valuable properties of the bank were either destroyed or carted away"" by the group that included law enforcement officers. It did not say what was taken. The bank said it was involved in a legal bid to overturn the writ.

ZURICH/LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Dutch lender ING (INGA.AS) and France's BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) have decided to stop financing trade in crude oil from Ecuador, the banks said on Monday, after pressure from campaigners aiming to protect the Amazon rainforest.

The role of European lenders in backing the trade came under scrutiny in August, when a report by advocacy groups Stand.earth and Amazon Watch named six European banks as major financiers of Ecuadorean oil exports to U.S. refineries.

Indigenous leaders battling to prevent further oil exploration in their territory said the banks' role had made them complicit in oil spills, violations of land rights and the destruction of rainforest by Ecuador's oil industry.

""The banks' commitment is a milestone,"" Marlon Vargas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, told Reuters. ""The banks should finance other forms of economic development, but not oil extraction.""

The August report had named the three banks alongside France's Natixis (CNAT.PA), Switzerland's UBS (UBSG.S) and Dutch bank Rabobank as the main backers of the shipment of about $10 billion of Ecuadorean oil to the United States over the past decade.

Campaigners had accused the banks of using double standards for making climate change pledges while backing trade in oil from Ecuador, where the industry plans to drill hundreds of wells in the Yasuni National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.

ING said it shared many of the concerns in the report over protecting the Amazon and had decided to review its exposure to oil and gas exports from Ecuador.

'ENGAGEMENT ONGOING'

""Our research and resulting engagements are ongoing,"" the bank said. ""In the meantime, we have decided not to engage in any new contracts for the financing of oil and gas trade flows from the Ecuadorian Amazon.""

Credit Suisse said it had decided to phase out financing for oil exports from the Ecuadorean and Peruvian Amazon after completing existing commitments.

""Credit Suisse reviews and updates its sector-specific policies on a regular basis,"" the bank said.

BNP Paribas said it had decided in December to exclude oil exports from Ecuador's Esmeraldas region - home to Ecuador's export terminal for oil from its Amazon region.

""BNP Paribas is committed to the continuous improvement of its sustainability strategy,"" the bank said.

Rabobank said in August that it had stopped financing Ecuadorean crude cargoes earlier in 2020.

UBS, for now, has stopped short of committing to end its financing of Ecuadorean crude oil cargoes. The bank said it maintained dialogue with advocacy groups and was committed to the highest environmental and social standards.

""As such we have declined transactions where the origin of oil is verifiably associated with breaches of our standards, such as indigenous peoples' land rights or UNESCO World Heritage Sites,"" the bank said.

Natixis, meanwhile, financed cargoes of 5.5 million barrels of oil from the Ecuadorean Amazon from July to December - more than double the volume it backed in the first half of the year, according to an analysis of U.S. customs data by Stand.earth and Amazon Watch.

Natixis said that it continued to ""proactively"" screen transactions for potential environmental or social risks and understood that financing Ecuador's oil exports could encourage plans by the industry to expand into the Yasuni National Park.

""Given this situation, Natixis has declined to finance any new clients involved in oil exports from Ecuador since mid-2020 and has reduced the number of existing clients it works with in this area,"" a Natixis spokesperson said.

'GROWING SCRUTINY'

Ecuador's oil industry says that taking care of the environment and maintaining a harmonious relationship with people living in its operational areas is a priority. State-owned oil company Petroecuador did not respond to a request for comment.

With oil output of about 0.5 million barrels per day, or 0.5% of global volumes, according to BP's statistical review, Ecuador ranks as a mid-sized producer. Much of its oil is used to pay the country's debts to China.

The move by the banks could complicate the export of oil from Ecuador because trading companies that were using their services will have to find other banks to back their transactions. Swiss trading house Gunvor, identified in the report as one of the firms trading Ecuadorean crude, declined to comment.

""Any banks involved in this trade will face growing scrutiny, unless Ecuador's government puts a moratorium on new drilling and addresses the environmental damage and rights violations caused by existing production,"" said Tzeporah Berman, international programmes director at Stand.earth.

""Ecuador is going to need support to get out from under crushing debt, but new drilling in primary forests without consent from indigenous peoples is not the solution.""

With asset managers under pressure to rebalance their portfolios to help to slow climate change, tropical deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, the stance of emerging market governments on such issues is facing growing scrutiny.

""We have to position as investors with countries that are taking an active approach to governing and environmental concerns, and obviously some countries are better placed to do that than others,"" said Carlos de Sousa, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, which has exposure to Ecuador's sovereign bonds.

Alaska SeaLife Center has announced plans to become a first responder for marine mammals affected by oil spills in Western Alaska.

The nonprofit center in Seward said a new partnership with the Alaska Chadux Network will greatly expand the center’s service area, the Juneau Empire reported Saturday.

Alaska SeaLife Center is the state’s only permanent marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation facility, the center’s website said.

SeaLife Center chief operating officer Chip Arnold said the facility did not have the ability to respond to oil spills when it opened in 1998, but people knew the time would come.

“We knew we would be involved,” Arnold said. “It was never a question of if we were going to respond. We are going to respond.”

Alaska SeaLife Center has trained more than 430 responders from across the U.S. over the last several years who are ready to “drop everything” and travel to Alaska to assist with relief efforts in the event of an oil spill, Arnold said.

The center has developed infrastructure to treat marine mammals affected by oil spills, including eight mobile containers and a cleaning station, Arnold said.

Alaska Chadux Network is a nonprofit oil spill response organization headquartered in Anchorage with 17 equipment hubs and the capacity for 24-hour response, the network’s website said.

Chadux Network President Buddy Custard said in a statement that the collaboration with SeaLife Center meets the requirements of state and federal agencies and companies that will benefit from the oil spill response capabilities.

“We are now extending wildlife rehabilitation all the way out to Western Alaska,” Custard said. “Alaska is home to many species that are endangered or threatened, so we want to make sure we can protect those species for generations to come.”

Western Alaska incorporates the coastline from Point Barrow in the state’s northernmost region to the end of the Aleutian Islands chain, Custard said.

The partnership with SeaLife Center comes as regional shipping activity is expected to increase because of ongoing Arctic ice melt, Custard said.

“Because the sea ice is receding, that’s expanding shipping lanes up north,” Custard said. “Which means there’s going to be more and more encounters up there with marine mammals and shipping, as well as an increased risk of a potential oil spill up in those regions.”"

Eventually the ship broke in half and her cargo of 85,000 tonnes of light crude oil spilled out into the North Atlantic. You could smell hydrocarbons in the air 25 miles away in Lerwick. It was Scotland’s worst environmental disaster, but it could have been so much worse.

The Braer was on the way to Canada with oil from Norway travelling through hurricane force winds blowing around Shetland. Around 5am on January 5, 1993, the crew reported a loss of power but they said the ship was in no immediate danger. An attempt to tow the tanker away from the shore failed and in the late morning she was well and truly stuck on rocks.

Over the next six days, the storm and the rising and falling tides ground the ship against the rocks until she split in two. All her cargo of oil escaped.

Seven-year fishing restrictions

At least 1,500 sea birds died and up to a third of the local grey seal population was affected, despite heroic efforts by volunteers trying to save wildlife. Local people also reported experiencing respiratory problems.

After plenty of legal wrangling, £45 million was paid out in compensation, much of it seven years after the actual oil spill. Local fishing restrictions were not lifted until the summer of 2000.

Shags and thousands of other oiled seabirds were taken to Inverkeithing SSPCA in an attempt to clean them (Picture: Allan Milligan)

Unlike the heavy crude oil which blanketed beaches and waterways in disasters like the Torry Canyon and the Exxon Valdez, the Braer was carrying light crude oil. This is more like diesel than the treacly sludge of those other spills. Very fortunately for Shetland the continuing stormy weather blew the oil mainly away from the shore and much of it was dispersed by the rough seas.

The subsequent Donaldson inquiry recommended the stationing of massive sea-going emergency tugs in strategic locations around the UK including Lerwick and Stornoway. Over the years these two have been reduced to one tug based at Kirkwall. When the Transocean Winner oil rig ran aground in the Western Isles in 2016 the Kirkwall tug was 12 hours away. Even this provision was threatened with withdrawal and only saved by a public campaign.

126 oil spills last year

Oil tankers are part of a vicious circle. The more oil we use, the worse climate change gets, the higher the risk that another tanker will be caught in a storm it cannot cope with. And with the threat of oil production in the Arctic, the problems of dealing with any spill are magnified many times over.

The tanker's final movements as it is broken up by the sea (Picture: Ian Rutherford)

It is not just tankers that lose oil. The North Sea oil industry accidentally released oil or gas 126 times last year, up from 100 times the year before, with three incidents classified as major in preliminary figures from the Health and Safety Executive.

This month Denmark, the largest oil producer in the EU, joined a growing list of countries which have decided to end exploration for further oil and gas and plan to phase out fossil fuel production entirely. Ending oil production is the only sure way of ending the risk of oil spills.

But one reality is eternal: The arguments against Keystone XL are as weak today as ever.

The all-purpose climate argument is the central focus: Keystone XL supposedly would worsen anthropogenic (manmade) climate change.

The pipeline would transport 830,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude oil, the total greenhouse gas emissions from which would be about 150 million metric tons per year, or about 0.3 percent of the world total. If we apply the EPA climate model using the least favorable set of assumptions, those emissions would have a global temperature effect of about four ten-thousandths of a degree Celsius by 2100. The impacts upon sea levels and other climate phenomena would be similarly undetectable; so much for the ubiquitous empty rhetoric about the “climate disaster” supposedly to be engendered by Keystone XL. Why do the opponents attempt to obscure this?

The opponents of the pipeline occasionally concede that, yes, the climate impacts of stopping Keystone XL would be very close to zero, but that many such actions globally would add up to something significant. Nope: The global climate effects of even large emissions cuts also would be very small. Net-zero emissions by the U.S.: 0.17° Celsius The entire Paris agreement: 0.17° Celsius. Net-zero emissions by the entire OECD: 0.35° Celsius. A 25 percent emissions reduction by the entire world: about 0.5° Celsius.

The opponents argue as well that the pipeline would create a danger of spills. But transport of oil by pipeline is substantially safer than transport by rail or truck, the real-world alternatives to Keystone XL. For crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S., pipelines carry about 70 percent of the ton-miles; the respective figures for water transport, trucking, and railroads are 23 percent, four percent, and three percent.

If we ignore water transport (not relevant as an alternative for Keystone XL), the data on adverse incidents—explosions or fires, spills of five gallons or more, fatalities, personal injuries requiring hospitalization, or all-inclusive property damage exceeding $50,000–show that pipeline incidents per ton-mile are about a quarter of those for rail transport, and about three percent of those for truck transport.

This vastly greater safety of Keystone XL over the alternatives is important because the heavy Canadian oil will be produced with or without the pipeline. This is because for the heavy Canadian oil to be transported by Keystone XL, the fixed costs sunk into the projects before any oil is produced are uniquely high relative to the cost of actually producing the oil. So given that the fixed costs have been incurred, even sharp declines in world oil prices will not prevent the oil from being produced.

Accordingly, without Keystone XL, the heavy oil will be produced, but transported by rail or truck, to be refined in northern or eastern refineries. Lighter oil from U.S. hydraulic fracturing operations will be sent to the Gulf Coast refineries despite the fact that those facilities are optimized for heavier crudes. So, the net effect of stopping Keystone XL will be an inefficient allocation of crude oil geographically. In short: Without the pipeline, railroad capacity will grow, overall safety will decline, and economic costs will be higher. Who would benefit from that outcome?

These realities demonstrate that the opposition to Keystone XL is almost wholly ideological, driven by a quasi-religious abhorrence of fossil fuels and the wealth, human wellbeing, and independence from government coercion that they facilitate. When President Biden announces the revocation of the permit, perhaps a journalist might ask him to explain his reasoning, and how that rationale was informed, or not, by the truths summarized above."

What happens to hair after it’s been trimmed? Usually, the piles of clippings are simply swept off the floor and discarded.

But if you’re at a salon or barbershop in France, there’s a chance your hair will end up cleaning the ocean. More than 3,000 hairdressers have signed up to the Coiffeurs Justes, an organization that takes discarded hair and turns it into booms that can absorb oil.

Floating sausages

The project is the brainchild of Thierry Gras, a hairdresser in Saint-Zacharie, a small town in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region of France. Since 2015, he has been recruiting salons from all over France, and now beyond, to recycle waste hair.

Members collect the clippings, bag them up and send them to a warehouse in the town of Brignoles. There, workers who were formerly unemployed, or who left school without qualifications, are paid to stuff the hair into nylon stockings, creating floating sausages that can absorb up to eight times their weight in oil.

These sausages have been used in a successful trial in the harbour at Cavalaire-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean. Now Gras is hoping to expand production, selling each nylon tube for €9 (approximately $11), and reinvesting some of the proceeds in the employment centre where the tubes are stuffed.

Super absorbent

The absorbent properties of hair are well known – after all, billions of dollars are spent every year on shampoos and other products to wash oils out of it. “Hair is lipophilic,” Gras told AFP, “so it absorbs hydrocarbons.” As a child, he remembers hearing stories of hair being used to help clean up after the Amoco Cadiz oil spill off northern France in 1978.

More recently hair was used to mop up oil from the MV Wakashio, a bulk carrier that ran aground on a reef on the island of Mauritius. Locals donated their hair, and packed it in bags with straw and fabric in a desperate attempt to stop oil damaging the fragile ecology of the region.

Hair is superior in many ways to manufactured materials often used to soak up spills. It costs nothing to produce, is biodegradable and there is an inexhaustible supply (hair grows on us at a rate of roughly 1cm a month). It can be washed so that hair sponges can be used again and again.

Using hair in this way also stops it from ending up in the trash, where it can cause damage to wildlife. In fact, cleaning up oil spills is just one of many potential uses for hair – from making wigs, weaves, mats and rope, to deterring pests like deer from gardens, and even as a source of amino acids to make cosmetics and pet food.

So next time you get a trim, check where your discarded hair is going – it could be making a small contribution to a cleaner planet."

It pledged to support regulators in tracing the source.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that fishermen around the Atlantic Ocean coastline reported an oil leak suspected to be from the Funiwa fields on Sunday.

Esimaje Brikinn, General-Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Chevron, said the oil firm remained committed to tracing the source of the spill, as part of a joint effort by operators in the area to investigate the leakage.

“The observed spill has been reported by CNL to the appropriate regulatory agencies.

“For spills found within an operator’s operational area, the operator is required to contain the spill, followed by a Joint Investigation Visit by all stakeholders for assessment and further action.

“No spill has been observed within CNL’s operational area, but we are monitoring this incident.

“CNL operates in strict compliance with the relevant laws and regulations governing the Nigerian petroleum industry and remains committed to the safety of people and the environment,’’ he stated.

Chevron and two other companies operate near the spill location.

NAN gathered that the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) had summoned all the oil firms operating in the shallow waters near Koluama in Bayelsa in a bid to identify the source of the leaks.

Musa Idris, Director-General, NOSDRA, told NAN in a telephone interview that the spills regulatory agency would dispatch its officials to the incident site.

Meanwhile, Young Fabby, a community leader in Koluama 1, one of the impacted communities, told NAN that a joint team of Bayelsa government officials, oil firms operating in the area have scheduled a visit to the spill site for Friday.

“With the Joint Investigation Team visiting today, more facts will emerge. We are expecting the team to commence clean-up and remediation activities though the incident took place sometime around Saturday and oil discharge noticed since Sunday.

“There was high tidal currents at that time and it spread the oil ashore to the mangroves; we are ready to show the investigation team round when they arrive,” the community leader stated. (NAN)"

The role of European lenders in backing the trade came under scrutiny in August, when a report by advocacy groups Stand.earth and Amazon Watch named six European banks as major financiers of

Ecuadorean oil exports to U.S. refineries.

Indigenous leaders battling to prevent further oil exploration in their territory said the banks' role had made

them complicit in oil spills, violations of land rights, and the destruction of rainforest by Ecuador's oil industry.

""The banks' commitment is a milestone,"" Marlon Vargas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, told Reuters. ""The banks should finance other forms of economic development, but not oil extraction.""

The August report had named the three banks alongside France's Natixis, Switzerland's UBS and Dutch

bank Rabobank as the main backers of the shipment of about $10 billion of Ecuadorean oil to the United States over the past decade.

Campaigners had accused the banks of using double standards for making climate change pledges while backing trade in oil from Ecuador, where the industry plans to drill hundreds of wells in the Yasuni National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.

ING said it shared many of the concerns over protecting the Amazon outlined in the report and had decided to review its exposure to oil and gas exports from Ecuador.

""Our research and resulting engagements are ongoing,"" the bank said. ""In the meantime, we have decided not to engage in any new contracts for the financing of oil and gas trade flows from the Ecuadorian Amazon.""

Credit Suisse said it had decided to phase out financing for oil exports from the Ecuadorean and Peruvian Amazon after completing existing commitments.

""Credit Suisse reviews and updates its sector-specific policies on a regular basis,"" the bank said.

BNP Paribas said it had decided in December to exclude oil exports from Ecuador's Esmeraldas region -- home to Ecuador's export terminal for oil from its Amazon region.

""BNP Paribas is committed to the continuous improvement of its sustainability strategy,"" the bank said.

Rabobank said in August it had stopped financing Ecuadorean crude cargoes earlier in 2020.

UBS, for now, has stopped short of committing to end its financing of Ecuadorean crude oil cargoes. The bank said it maintained a dialogue with advocacy groups and was committed to the highest environmental and social standards.

""As such we have declined transactions where the origin of oil is verifiably associated with breaches of our standards, such as indigenous peoples' land rights or UNESCO World Heritage Sites,"" the bank said.

Natixis, meanwhile, financed cargoes of 5.5 million barrels of oil from the Ecuadorean Amazon from July to December — more than double the volume it backed in the first half of the year, according to an analysis of U.S. customs data by Stand.earth and Amazon Watch.

Natixis said that it continued to ""proactively"" screen transactions for potential environmental or social risks, and understood that financing Ecuador's oil exports could encourage plans by the industry to expand into the Yasuni National Park.

""Given this situation, Natixis has declined to finance any new clients involved in oil exports from Ecuador since mid-2020 and has reduced the number of existing clients it works within this area,"" a Natixis spokesperson said.

With oil output of around 0.5 million barrels per day, or 0.5% of global volumes, according to BP's statistical review, Ecuador ranks as a mid-sized producer. Much of its oil is used to pay the country's debts to China."

The court also ordered the Anglo-Dutch giant to install appropriate equipment to prevent future damage to oilfield infrastructure.

Lengthy case

The case was launched by four Nigerian farmers in 2008, who alleged that widespread pollution on their land was caused by leaks from oil infrastructure due to a lack of repair and maintenance activities.

Shell had argued that illegal bunkering operations caused the leaks, but the Court of Appeal in The Hague found the oil company had not proven “beyond reasonable doubt” that this was the case.

“This makes Shell Nigeria responsible for the damage caused by the leaks” in the villages of Goi and Oruma, the court said, adding that the amount of compensation would be “determined at a later stage"".

Shell 'violated duty of care' - FoE

The farmers’ 13-year legal case was backed by the environmental groups Friends of the Earth International through its Dutch branch, known as Milieudefensie.

Article continues below the advert

FoE said the court ruled in favour of the farmers “on most points,” highlighting that Shell Nigeria, in particular, “is liable for oil pollution at three locations in the Niger Delta”, while parent company Royal Dutch Shell “also violated its duty of care"".

FoE said three of the four Nigerian plaintiffs and their fellow villagers must now be compensated for the damage caused and Shell must ensure that there is a leakage detection system in the pipelines in Nigeria.

“It is the first time that a court has held a Dutch transnational corporation accountable for its duty of care abroad,” said FoE.

The campaign group said the lawsuit centres on oil leaks in three villages that have rendered fields and fish ponds unusable, while the spilled oil has never been “thoroughly cleaned up and new oil is still leaking out regularly"".

'Bittersweet' victory

Eric Dooh from Goi, one of the four Nigerian farmers, said: “Finally, there is some justice for the Nigerian people suffering the consequences of Shell’s oil. It is a bittersweet victory, since two of the plaintiffs, including my father, did not live to see the end of this trial. But this verdict brings hope for the future of the people in the Niger Delta.”

Channa Samkalden, lawyer for the farmers and FoE Netherlands, said that, “after years of litigation, there is finally justice for many of my clients,” with only the case in Ikot Ada Udo still ongoing.

“Not only is Shell liable for the oil spill and my clients will get what they are entitled to, this case also shows that European companies must behave responsibly abroad.”

Tougher legislation call

Donald Pols, director of FoE Netherlands, added that the compensation decision is “enormous” and should serve as “a warning for all Dutch transnational corporations involved in injustice worldwide"".

On the back of the court’s findings, FoE Netherlands and its parent organisation are calling for ambitious European Union and international legislation to hold businesses accountable for harms they do overseas.

Jill McArdle, corporate justice campaigner for FoE Europe, said: “No victim should have to wait 13 years for justice. We need better EU laws now to hold European companies liable for what happens in their supply chain.”

Shell 'disappointed'

In a statement emailed to Upstream, a spokesperson for Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) said: “We continue to believe that the spills in Oruma and Goi were the result of sabotage. We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that SPDC is liable.”

“Sabotage, crude oil theft and illegal refining are a major challenge in the Niger Delta,” said the statement.

SPDC said that, in 2019, around 95% of spill incidents from its operations in the delta were due to criminal acts, adding that “regardless of cause, we clean up and remediate, as we have done with the spills in this case"".

“SPDC also works with a range of stakeholders to find solutions to these complex issues. Like all Shell-operated ventures globally, we are committed to operating safely and protecting the local environment.”"

Record gasoline spill in Huntersville was Colonial Pipeline’s 32nd accident in N.C. since 2000

When Colonial Pipeline initially estimated it had spilled 63,000 gallons of gasoline from a ruptured pipeline in Huntersville last August, that sounded like a lot, about twice the amount in a backyard swimming pool. Now, five months after the disaster, town residents’ fears have come true: At 1.2 million gallons, the accident was the largest individual gasoline spill in U.S. history since at least 2000. To illustrate how many gallons escaped from the pipeline, the “Giant Peach” water tower in Gaffney, S.C., holds 1 million gallons of water.

This was not Colonial’s first spill in North Carolina, according to federal pipeline accident data. In fact, it was the company’s 32nd reported spill in the past 20 years. (There have been no fatalities or injuries attributed to these accidents.) The other major gasoline pipeline company in North Carolina is Plantation; it had one large spill in 2003, which accounts for most of its total in this century.

Today, we examine the spill numbers for Colonial nationwide and in North Carolina, as reported to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

The two were indicted Tuesday for spills in 2015 and 2018, according to complaints by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Workers in one platform joked that their motto was “safe and sound until production’s down,” the indictment said.

Fieldwood’s “top priority is to operate our facilities in a safe manner that protects” workers and the environment, the Houston-based company said in a statement. Fieldwood was not identified by name in the indictments or charged. It referred questions to attorneys for the two men.

Fieldwood area foreman Brandon Wall, 42, of Louisiana, was charged with negligent discharge and bypassing monitoring and safety systems to keep oil flowing at one of the company’s most prosperous platforms, according to the indictment.

“Shutting-in the platform for repairs or maintenance would have resulted in Company A making substantially less money,” the indictment said.

The actions released a “harmful quantity of oil and other hazardous substances.” Wall alerted regulators a month after an oil sheen was first sighted off the Grand Isle 43AA platform, the indictment said.

Wall did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Patrick Huse, 40, of Mississippi, a person-in-charge of other Fieldwood platforms, faces eight charges including knowingly releasing oil, misrepresenting to regulators and making false entries to inspection logs.

The company’s Main Pass 310A platform operated for four days in mid-2015 after operators first noticed the spill and alerted Huse, the indictment said. A harmful quantity of oil was released.

Huse did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Both men face jail time and fines if convicted.

Again. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden rescinded the federal permit that allowed the pipeline to cross the border from Canada. Barack Obama had halted the project in 2015, a month ahead of the Paris climate accord, only to see Donald Trump revive it during his first week as president. The message Biden sent on Wednesday was unambiguous — under his administration, the fossil fuel industry won’t enjoy the pampering and lax oversight it did under the previous one. By canceling Keystone XL, he’s putting Big Oil on notice that he’ll block construction of fossil fuel infrastructure that could undermine the nation’s steady transition to carbon-free energy over the next three decades. Biden — and his impressive climate cabinet -- are serious about decarbonizing the economy, and it’s a head-snapping reversal of U.S. climate policy. Killing Keystone XL sets the tone. The project was conceived in 2008 to transport gooey bitumen about 1,200 miles, from the Athabasca oil sands of Alberta through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Its history is marked by legal challenges, political maneuvering and protests in Washington, Ottawa and many points along the pipeline’s proposed path.

Biden -- and his impressive climate cabinet -- are serious about decarbonizing the economy, and it’s a head-snapping reversal of U.S. climate policy.

Among the prominent activists who fought against Keystone XL was Debra White Plume of the Oglala Lakota, who died just days after Biden was elected. Dedicated to protecting her tribal nation, she was arrested at the White House while protesting the pipeline in 2011. White Plume was motivated in part by climate change concerns but even more so by the immediate danger that the project would have posed to native land and water. Bold Nebraska, a group founded by celebrated activist Jane Kleeb, brought attention to the pipeline’s hazards to the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast groundwater source relied on by millions for drinking water and by High Plains agriculture for irrigation. The pipeline posed a dual threat — potential oil spills as well as critical depletion due to extended droughts caused by rising global temperatures. But the most egregious environmental devastation tied to Keystone XL is found at its origin, in Alberta’s tar sands. The site is “the world's largest industrial project,” where the bitumen is extracted from open-pit mines. The mining operation has created a smoking hellscape in tracts of boreal forest, which provides habitat for threatened wildlife and is a natural carbon sink. Processing bitumen requires an immense amount of fresh water that drains into toxic tailings ponds. And Alberta’s tar sands region has the most carbon-intensive oil production in North America.

(Andrew Burton/Getty Images) TC Energy, the owner of Keystone XL, had hoped to rescue the pipeline’s disastrous public image by pledging $1.7 billion to ensure that it used only renewable energy to operate the hundreds of pumping stations along the pipeline’s route. According to the Wall Street Journal, the firm proposed to “eliminate all greenhouse-gas emissions from operations by 2030,” which likely meant pouring money into renewable energy projects and purchasing carbon offsets. But that plan was only putting green lipstick on a pig of a pipeline — it would have done nothing to limit ecological damage or reduce emissions when the bitumen was ultimately refined and burned. TC Energy’s desperate greenwashing came about during hard times in the oil market, where the pandemic has crushed demand, and also in the pipeline business, which has suffered stunning setbacks over the past year. In July, a consortium of power producers canceled the Atlantic Coast Pipeline due to “legal uncertainties,” which alludes to the persistent challenges from environmental groups along with growing public pressure to make the shift to renewable energy.

The perpetrators of the oil spill remain shrouded in mystery however as a court in Haifa made the surprise decision yesterday to place a seven-day gagging order on the investigation into the spill that has washed up on more than 100 km of Israel’s shores. The court put out the order after some Israeli news outlets reported the name of a ship suspected of dumping the oil. Sometimes these spills are like trying to figure out who farted in a crowded room

Environmental protection minister Gila Gamliel said that the ministry is investigating the possibility that the pollution – believed to be about 1,000 tonnes of bunker fuel – was carried out purposely for malicious reasons.

“They either spilled the oil from the ship into the water or a malfunction occurred and they didn’t report it,” said Gamliel. “Finding those responsible for the disaster is a complicated process, but we will do everything in our power to find those culpable.”

Israeli authorities are working with European officials to review satellite images of ships that passed through the area.

The European Union monitors the location of oil slicks in the Mediterranean using information from a network of weather satellites.

Scientists can then use ocean current and weather data to track the source of the tar that washed up along Israel’s coastline.

Gamliel said over the weekend that nine ships that were in the area at the time were being looked at. Nevertheless, finding the culprit will not be easy.

One well-known US-based ship tracker told Splash today on condition of anonymity: “Sometimes these spills are like trying to figure out who farted in a crowded room.”

On Sunday, the ministry urged Israelis to stay away from the beaches, citing serious health hazards posed by the tar.

Deposits of tar have started washing up in southern Lebanon, including at two marine protection sites.

Caretaker Lebanese prime minister Hassan Diab has asked the defence and environment ministers to follow up and said the government was “acting accordingly to repair the damage caused by the leakage”."

A suspected oil tanker leak off the coast of Israel last week has led to Israel's biggest maritime ecological disaster in many years, with authorities closing the country's beaches and beginning a massive cleanup effort.

Chunks of sticky, black tar began washing up late last week. On Sunday, Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry warned people to avoid going to beaches from the country's northern border with Lebanon all the way to the south near the Gaza Strip. Tar exposure can make people sick and irritate the skin.

More than 4,000 volunteers from the Israeli nonprofit group EcoOcean have helped remove tar from beaches so far, according to the ministry.

The Israel Nature and Parks Authority warned that the ""consequences will be seen for years to come.""

Israeli environmental minister Gila Gamliel said Saturday that there are no more oil slicks visible off Israel's coast, ""which is an encouraging condition."" However the ministry warned that large waves are forecast this week. The waves could carry chunks of sticky tar from beach to beach, complicating cleanup efforts.

Israeli and European authorities are investigating what happened. Israeli officials believe a ship spilled tens or even hundreds of tons of oil in the Mediterranean, beyond the country's territorial waters.

The spill likely happened about a week ago, when stormy weather affected the region. It's unclear which ship or ships are responsible. Israeli authorities are working with European officials to review satellite images of ships that passed through the area.

The European Union monitors the location of oil slicks in the Mediterranean using information from a network of weather satellites. When ships release oil into the water, much of the oil pools at the surface and is carried great distances by currents. Scientists can use ocean current and weather data to reverse engineer the source of the tar that washed up along Israel's coastline.

Gamliel said Saturday that the ministry had zeroed in on fewer than a dozen ships, and was attempting to narrow it down further in the coming days, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

The tar pollution has already affected wildlife. Volunteers rushed to rescue sea birds, turtles and fish that were covered in oily residue or had ingested oil. Israel's National Sea Turtle Rescue Center confirmed that it was treating multiple turtles covered in tar.

One species that has ecologists particularly worried is a reef-building snail called Dendropoma petraeum. As the Mediterranean Sea heats up due to global warming, the snail's population on the Israeli coast has plummeted. That makes the species particularly vulnerable to other ecological disasters.

Environmental groups called it an disaster. Attesting to the cost to wildlife, they posted pictures of tar-covered turtles.

The event began last week during a winter storm, which made it harder to see the tar approaching and deal with it at sea, Israeli officials said.

Together with European agencies, Israel was looking as a possible source at a Feb 11 oil spill from a ship passing about 50km from shore. Satellite images and modelling of wave movements were helping to narrow the search.

Nine ships that were in the area at the time are being looked at, said Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel.

""There is a more than reasonable chance that we will be able to locate the specific ship,"" she told Ynet TV.

If found, Israel could take legal action. One course would be to sue insurance companies for compensation to help deal with the ecological fallout, she said, which could cost tens of millions of shekels.

The ruling is the second judgement against Shell this year regarding claims against its Nigerian operations.
In 2015, Shell agreed to pay out 55 million pounds ($83.4 million) to the Bodo community in Nigeria in compensation for two oil spills, which was the largest ever out-of-court settlement relating to Nigerian oil spills.","nigerian, day, farmers, sue, spdc, court, ruling, shell, spills, oil, uk, communities, vedanta, allows",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"The United Kingdom’s Supreme Court has ruled that a group of 42,500 Nigerian farmers and fishermen can sue Royal Dutch Shell in English courts after years of oil spills in the Niger Delta contaminated land and groundwater there.

Senior judges said there was an arguable case that UK-domiciled Shell, one of the world’s biggest energy companies, is responsible, in the latest test of whether multinationals can be held to account for the acts of overseas subsidiaries.

Represented by law firm Leigh Day, the group of Nigerians have argued that the parent company Shell owed them a duty of care because it either had significant control of, and was responsible for, its subsidiary SPDC. Shell countered that the court had no jurisdiction to try the claims.

“(The ruling) also represents a watershed moment in the accountability of multinational companies. Increasingly impoverished communities are seeking to hold powerful corporate actors to account and this judgement will significantly increase their ability to do so,” Daniel Leader, partner at Leigh Day, said on Friday.

“UK common law is also used in countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand so this is a very helpful precedent.”

The decision comes almost two years after a seminal ruling by the Supreme Court in a case involving mining firm Vedanta. The judgement allowed nearly 2,000 Zambian villagers to sue Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa.

That move was seen as a victory for rural communities seeking to hold parent companies accountable for environmental disasters. Vedanta ultimately settled out of court in January.

Members of Nigeria’s Ogale and Bille communities allege their lives and health have suffered because repeated oil spills have contaminated the land, swamps, groundwater and waterways and that there has been no adequate cleaning or remediation.

SPDC is the operator of oil pipelines in a joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation which holds a 55 percent stake, Shell which holds 30 percent, France’s Total with 10 percent and Italy’s Eni with five percent.

A Shell spokesman said the decision was disappointing.

“Regardless of the cause of a spill, SPDC cleans up and remediates. It also works hard to prevent these sabotage spills, by using technology, increasing surveillance and by promoting alternative livelihoods for those who might damage pipes and equipment,” Shell said.

Shell has blamed sabotage for oil spills. It said in its annual report published last March that SPDC, which produces around one million barrels of oil per day, saw crude oil spills caused by theft or pipeline sabotage surge by 41 percent in 2019.

Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said last week that the firm would take “another hard look at its onshore oil operations” in the West African country.

The ruling is the second judgement against Shell this year regarding claims against its Nigerian operations. In a landmark Dutch ruling two weeks ago, an appeals court held Shell responsible for multiple oil pipeline leaks in the Niger Delta, which is at the heart of the Nigerian oil industry, and ordered it to pay unspecified damages to farmers, in a victory for environmentalists.

Leigh Day said that the amount of compensation sought would be quantified as the case enters the trial stage.

In 2015, Shell agreed to pay out 55 million pounds ($83.4 million) to the Bodo community in Nigeria in compensation for two oil spills, which was the largest ever out-of-court settlement relating to Nigerian oil spills.

Shell discovered and started exploiting Nigeria’s vast oil reserves in the late 1950s and has faced heavy criticism from activists and local communities over spills and for the company’s close ties to government security forces."

But for cleaning tar out of the eyes, throats and nasal passages of sea turtles, a common sandwich condiment proved to be a better option this week following an oil spill in Israel. Employees at Israel's National Sea Turtle Rescue used mayonnaise to treat 11 endangered green sea turtles that washed ashore covered in tar, reports Nicoletta Lanse for Live Science.

Last week, an unknown source caused a massive oil spill in the Mediterranean Sea that left beaches coated in thick black tar. At least 120 miles of coastline was affected, leading Israel's Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) to call it one of the most severe ecological disasters the country has faced, reports Ariel Shalit for the Associated Press.

""They came to us full of tar. All their trachea from inside and outside was full of tar,"" says Guy Ivgy, a medical assistant at the Sea Turtle Rescue Center in Michmoret, to the Associated Press.

To aid the turtles in flushing out their digestive systems clogged with crude oil, workers at the sea turtle rescue are feeding them mayonnaise, which will break down the tar and make it easier to expel out as poop, Ivgy explained to Live Science.

Mayo and other fatty substances are used because they are emulsions, a mixture of two substances that don't usually combine easily, such as oil and water, reports Live Science. Despite being made up of oil and water, mayonnaise is held together by egg yolks. The egg yolks contain lecithin molecules that repel water on one side and dissolve water on the other. Lecithin acts as an emulsifier that mixes the water and oils, creating the sauce, reports Live Science.

The mix gives mayonnaise hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-loving) properties that allow it to interact with the hydrophobic oily tar inside the turtle's digestive tract. The mayonnaise's oil interacts with the tar making it thinner. The lecithin from egg yolks creates a barrier between the tar and the turtle's digestive tract when its hydrophobic side binds to the tar while its hydrophilic side faces the outside, reports Live Science.

On 29 January, a Dutch court found Shell liable for pollution caused by its Nigerian subsidiary in two Niger Delta villages and also ordered Shell to install a leak detection system on an oil pipeline.

Shell claimed the pollution was caused by sabotage, but the court found this was not proved “beyond reasonable doubt"". However, the Dutch court did issue an interim judgement saying an oil leak at Ikot Aka Udo was caused by sabotage, but did not establish liability.

Joeri Klein, a lawyer with Dutch firm Deminor Recovery Services, said: “It is likely we will see more of this type of case in the Netherlands and other west European jurisdictions in the years to come,” due to increasing global awareness of environmental and human right issues.

Friends of the Earth’s Dutch affiliate, which represented the villagers, said it would now lobby the European Union to adopt rules on mandatory supply chain due diligence.

According to London law firm Travers Smith, the European parliament “strongly supports such a law and has, unusually, proposed a draft text"".

Shell’s second blow came on 12 February when the UK Supreme Court overturned an appeal court decision and ruled Nigerian communities can sue the supermajor in England over oil pollution. Mark Dearn, director of Core — a human rights and environmental advocacy group that intervened in the UK case — said the ruling sends a clear message to multinationals: “You have a duty of care and you will be held to account for human rights abuses and environmental damage caused by subsidiaries you control.”

Building on a successful 2019 case in the UK against Vedanta in Zambia, both Shell judgments will leave corporate lawyers nervously eyeing potential liabilities and looking at ways to shield parent companies with overseas subsidiaries from being sued in their home countries.

Lebanese began cleaning beaches on Saturday after an oil spill deposited tar over large stretches of the coast in the southern part of the country.
Within days the spill had spread to southern Lebanon, where clumps of tar contaminated beaches stretching from the border town of Naqura to the southern city of Tyre.
“We will begin to remove the tar spots starting from the reserve coast, and hundreds of volunteers will help in the cleaning operation,” he said.
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told the DPA news agency that UNIFIL is studying ways to possibly help Lebanon counter the threat of an oil spill.","coast, cleaning, begins, tar, beaches, southern, lebanon, reserve, oil, spill, help",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"Volunteers in southern Lebanon begin removing tar from beaches after an oil spill that could endanger marine life.

Lebanese began cleaning beaches on Saturday after an oil spill deposited tar over large stretches of the coast in the southern part of the country.

A storm more than a week ago threw tonnes of the sticky, black substance onto beaches in neighbouring Israel, apparently after leaking from an oil tanker off the Israeli coast.

Within days the spill had spread to southern Lebanon, where clumps of tar contaminated beaches stretching from the border town of Naqura to the southern city of Tyre.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said about $14m had been earmarked to clean up the country’s shoreline, in what has been described as Israel’s biggest environmental disaster.

In Lebanon, the management of Tyre Coast Nature Reserve, one of the country’s last remaining sandy beaches and an important nesting site for endangered loggerhead and green sea turtles, said the spill could endanger marine life and biodiversity in the area.

Mouin Hamze, director of the reserve, told reporters that the cleaning operation will take at least 15 days.

“We will begin to remove the tar spots starting from the reserve coast, and hundreds of volunteers will help in the cleaning operation,” he said.

“The nature reserve is suffering from approximately 2 tonnes of tar, 90 percent of which is hidden under the sand,” he added.

The protected zone covers 3.8 square kilometres (almost 1.5 square miles) of the beach as well as adjacent sea waters, according to its website.

The reserve was included in the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance in 2012.

Hamze had said previously that the pollution could continue washing up on Lebanese shores for up to three months.

A survey of the area using drones is not yet complete, but he said the damage was extensive in the south while tar had even landed on the beach further north in the capital Beirut.

United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told the DPA news agency that UNIFIL is studying ways to possibly help Lebanon counter the threat of an oil spill.

“UNIFIL has been contacted by local authorities to see what help can be provided within our available capabilities and equipment. We are studying these requests to see how we can help,” Tenenti said."

RICHMOND, Calif. (KGO) -- The Chevron refinery in Richmond is investigating an oil spill Tuesday afternoon, according to city and county officials.The spill happened in what's called the ""Long Wharf"" off Point Richmond, where a sheen can be seen on the top of the water at Bear Point.It was first noticed around 3 p.m.""It smelled like somebody spilled gasoline in front of my house it smelled very very badly for whole day,"" said Margaret Berczynski, who is furious that no text alert went out about the spill.Everyone was quick to talk about the smell, ""I smelled it and I thought something is going on,"" said Sue Dennett.California's Office of Emergency Services (OES) says a pipeline was leaking approximately five gallons a minute until the leak was stopped around 4:40 p.m.Contra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia says ""close to 600 gallons"" flowed into the Bay during that time. Something he calls ""unacceptable.""As for wildlife that may have been in the water, Eric Laughlin of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife says, ""There haven't been any oiled animals reported at this time, but we do have the oil wildlife care network on standby.""Some nearby neighbors say this happens near refineries.""It's a necessary evil and it's not going away anytime,"" said neighbor Jeff Mulvihill.Others say what happened is unacceptable and someone needs to be held accountable.""I'm really devastated, I'm really devastated.

A Greek-owned and flagged oil tanker has been named as the main suspect in a major oil spill that drenched Israel’s scenic Mediterranean shoreline with tar last week.

Israel’s Kan public broadcaster reported Monday that the Minerva Helen is under investigation as the likely culprit in the spill. The ship is also suspected of being responsible for a major spill off the coast of Copenhagen, Denmark in January 2008.

The Greek company that owns the Minerva Helen responded to Kan, saying that it was “not the source of the leak” off of Israel’s coast, and also denied responsibility for the Danish spill in 2008.

On Tuesday, Haifa Magistrate’s Court Judge Zayed Falah partially lifted a gag order on details of the investigation into the environmental disaster.

The Minerva Helen left Port Said, Egypt on February 11 en route to Israel. It allegedly experienced a significant leak in international waters, more than 50 kilometers off the Israeli coast, turned around and set sail for another port in Egypt. It is now anchored off the coast of Cartagena, Spain.

Environmental experts warn that the cleanup of Israel’s beaches could take years.

“I’ve been working for over a decade at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and I’ve never seen something like this before,” Roei Shtrauss, manager of the Sharon district at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, told The Media Line.

According to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, some 170 kilometers, or 105 miles, out of 190 kilometers, or 118 miles, of Israel’s beaches have been damaged by the offshore oil spill, marking one of the worst ecological disasters in the country in over a decade.

“I don’t know what led to the spill but it was not reported to the Ministry of Environmental Protection,” Shtrauss said. “This is not right and it’s illegal. If they would have reported the spill, all of the organizations here could have prepared much better and not been taken by surprise.”

Evidence of the tar spill first emerged last week, when a 17-meter (55-foot) baby fin whale was found dead, washed up on a beach in southern Israel, as was other marine wildlife.

Thousands of volunteers are working on a daily basis to remove clumps of sticky tar from the country’s sandy beaches, which are popular with tourists and locals. The Israel Defense Forces also has deployed thousands of soldiers to help with the cleanup.

“The beaches belong to all of us,” a volunteer named Tiviet told the Media Line as she picked up small pieces of tar from the sand at Sharon Beach Nature Reserve north of Tel Aviv.

“The size of the pollution is so big that we need every person available to come and help,” she said.

Michael Raphael is the national coordinator of the Mediterranean People Campaign, a nonprofit coalition of Israeli environmental organizations that is pushing for the establishment of regulated marine-protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea.

“The issue is that the tar has gotten on the very sensitive ecological areas in the Mediterranean Sea and that’s going to be much more difficult to take away and clean,” Raphael told The Media Line. “That could take up to 10-15 years.”

The cost of the beach cleanup alone is expected to reach tens of millions of dollars, according to an initial estimate from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. However, the full economic impact of the incident remains to be seen and the government has promised to sue the responsible party for damages.

I don’t know what led to the spill but it was not reported to the Ministry of Environmental Protection. This is not right and it’s illegal. If they would have reported the spill, all of the organizations here could have prepared much better and not been taken by surprise.

Experts have warned that the spill also spells trouble for another major oil project that Israel has planned. The country recently reached an agreement to transport Emirati crude oil by tanker to a pipeline in the Red Sea port city of Eilat, which was signed after the two nations normalized ties last year.

Over 200 scientists from Israel and around the globe have cautioned the Israeli government against the move, which they say could irreversibly damage the unique coral reefs in the Red Sea.

“The entire world is working to shift away from petrol and oil because of climate change and we are putting ourselves in jeopardy here,” Maya Jacobs, CEO of the Zalul Environmental Association, told The Media Line.

“Our prime minister ran to the beach to take pictures of himself as if he’s doing something to clean up the shore,” Jacobs added. “But [the government] didn’t transfer any money in order to be able to actually fund this.”

Others also lamented what they called a lack of government preparedness to respond to environmental disasters.

“Two to three years ago we understood that the Ministry of Environmental Protection has not been given the tools, authority or budget that they need to protect the seas from oil spills,” Arik Rosenblum, director of EcoOcean, told The Media Line.

For this reason, EcoOcean independently organized and trained a network of volunteers to be able to respond quickly in times of crisis. In addition, the organization’s state-of-the-art research vessel is used by researchers across the country.

“We’ve taken the ship out from Herzliya to the south in order to try to identify the situation as to the quantity of oil components in the water,” Rosenblum explained. “It shows us if there are perhaps more tar elements [that will] come and hit our beaches.”

On Tuesday, the Cabinet approved the allocation of $13.7 million to remove the tar from the beaches and repair the ecological damage. The Cabinet vote also requires Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel to within 30 days submit draft legislation on readiness and response to maritime oil pollution events.

As tar continues to wash up on shore, authorities have warned the public to stay away from the beaches and to not go swimming until further notice.

With many Israelis cooped up at home for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the hopes of some fun and sun at the beach have been washed out to sea, at least for now."

A current ban from Mediterranean seafood and fish is in effect as the public and soldiers pictured above scrambles to clean up the tar. We reached out. The company denies any link.

Update March 2, 2021: The Israel Government sends a team to Greece and exonerates the Greek ship. They now accuse Iran of eco-terrorism.

Give Israelis an emergency and you will see what kind of stuff they are made of. The recent crisis is a large oil spill which is currently washing mounds of goopy tar-like bitumen onto every inch of beach along Israel’s 170-mile coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.

The bitumen also known as dilbit can have some suspected links to rare cancers, and is more dangerous than regular oil (read InsideClimateNews here) and is suspected to be from the bilge of an oil tanker passing through the Mediterranean Sea, about 31 miles off the coast of Israel. The source of the tanker is unknown, but those close to the heart of the matter suspect it was poor weather and just a tanker in trouble that caused the release. Local media are blaming a tanker called Minerva Helen, which flies under the flag of Greece. The name was revealed yesterday after a gag order lifted. We spoke with the company and they deny any link.

The feeling on the ground in Israel is not who or which country is to blame, but what kind of system can we have in place for the future. Because as long as there are tankers and pipelines and us using oil, spills are bound to happen. One tanker off the coast of Yemen is a floating time bomb.

The horrendous photos of dead turtles and a rotting baby whale with its belly full of tar dead ashore an Israeli beach has impacted the public to spring into action –– some 10,000 people have turned up to help pull the beached globs of oil out of corals, rock faces and sand. This was orchestrated through an NGO called EcoOcean which already had a plan of action set up two years ago. The organization has not only helped citizens see how they can make an effort to clean up the problem, but it has set an example to the Israeli government on how to future proof against environmental disasters.

Typically Israel’s Ministries act in response to demonstrations and lobbyists’ concerns du jour. They act when faced with a crisis but they don’t like anyone telling them what to do.

So when Andreas Weil, a then new immigrant to Israel from Sweden wanted to change how Mediterranean marine education and health was managed by Israel, he didn’t whine or point fingers. He made a plan, raised money, built a research ship and an educational system, and started teaching the Israeli colleges, non-profits, government groups and society how to cooperate to protect the sea. That was 15 years ago, and the NGO is called EcoOcean. Among its flagship projects is the Blue Flag Program to clean Israeli beaches, in better times from cigarette butts, and municipal runoff.

In worse times EcoOcean was ready, Weil tells Green Prophet. Two years ago he approached the Ministry of the Environment and asked if he could set up a coordinated beach cleanup system, for emergency purposes. At the time there was nothing in place. He said he would build a pilot. If EcoOcean could use some of their resources, then a system could be up and running well within 3 years, with volunteers trained and equipment set up. At that point he’d convince the government to find money and run it.

EcoOcean raised almost $1 million USD and set up the emergency beach response plan which was mobilized right away: “This week more than 10,000 people were helping, some of them running around in dangerous amounts of tar,” says Weil. “We did all this to push the Environment Ministry to take responsibility for what it needs to do. I hope this accident will make it happen. There is no way they can retract now and say they don’t need a plan like this.”

Unlike other hopeful activists that try and change the Israeli attitude to a “green” one, Weil, as an outsider from Sweden, with a no-nonsense socialist mentality just wanted to “get the money for it and show the government how it can be done.”

“It’s definitely a Swedish thing,” he says. “I guess there is a reason why we are giving out the Nobel Peace Prize,” says Weil, who over the years of knowing him, I can also say it’s also an Andreas thing. He’s consistently persisted and built and encouraged others to be part of the dream of saving the sea, usually putting everyone else from the organization in the spotlight instead of himself. Organizations like the Cousteau Foundation have reached out to cooperate with him.

“This is what I learned from living in Israel,” says Weil. “I saw how they were working. They were spending money on an agenda, demonstrating. And I thought, how can we do it differently? Israelis listen to common sense. They don’t want to hear you telling them to pick up plastic from the street.”

Weil’s foresight rang true.

And from their homes the people came to clean up the sea. Organizing on parents’ Whatsapp groups, Facebook groups that promote parties: everyone was turning out to be part of the cleanup.

Clumps of tar larger than footballs were rolling up onto shore and volunteers mobilized to move it from reefs and rocks into plastic bags for disposal. One of them was Ariel Mielnik, 32, a clinical psychologist from Jaffa. He found some like-minded people on a Whatsapp group, The Friends of Jaffa, to clean up beaches in the Tel Aviv area: “We arrived and the staff gave us all kinds of protective equipment and gave us a fast brief on what to do,” he tells Green Prophet.

“We blasted electronic music throughout the beach, having a good time while cleaning up as much as we could and for as long as we had free time,” he says. “It was heartwarming to see so many volunteers. Runners would clap for us and shout ‘kol hakavod [good for you]’ which was nice.

“I imagined black pools of tar and tar stuck to everything. The good news, when we approached we couldn’t even see it. Now the very bad news is the tar has spread to small pieces of around 4 mm, which makes it super difficult to pick up bit by bit. Only us humans can do this as far as I know, and the job feels impossible to complete.”

Fashion photographer and videographer Doron Barsky, also from Jaffa, headed further north and was shocked by the blobs of tar as far as the eye could see. He was at a beach in the northern part of the country called Nasholim, helping fill bags with tar and hardened oil rocks.

He shows the oil in his hands in the video below.

A gag order kept the identity of the ship unknown, until Wednesday at 4 PM where it was released to the mainstream media that the suspect ship is the Minerva Helen, the same Greek ship involved in major oil spill near Copenhagen in 2008. The gag order was put in place so those running the oil tanker would not destroy evidence.

The Minerva Helen left Port Said, Egypt on February 11 en route to Israel and denies any connection to the oil spill. It also denied its involvement in the Danish oil spill.

The vessel (IMO: 9276561, MMSI 240147000) is a Crude Oil Tanker built in 2004, 17 years old. You can track the Minerva Helen online and environmentalists might consider meeting it as it reaches its next port Piraeus, Greece, on February 27. It is owned by Minerva Marine, from Athens, Greece. A statement from the company denies any connection to the spill.

They announce to the media, “On the 15th of February 2021 the vessel sailed directly to Cartagena Spain. During the period that the vessel was drifting offshore Port Said awaiting her next employment, the vessel was not involved in any operation nor in any other activity that could be connected to an oil discharge at sea.

“The vessel is classed with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). Minerva Helen is well maintained without any structural or other defects that could cause an oil pollution incident.

“It should be noted that on the 22nd of February 2021 the vessel was inspected by the Spanish Port State Control Authorities in Cartagena and was determined to be without any deficiencies or observations, and confirmed that the vessel was in a satisfactory maintenance and operational condition without any defect.”

Jonathan Spencer, a crisis response manager representing the company tells Green Prophet: “There are no formal allegations regarding Minerva Helen, despite speculation having continued in some media outlets. For your reference, I have also attached an article published by one of the shipping industries leading data and intelligence companies which further demonstrates that Minerva Helen could not have been involved (The link to a PDF is here).”

Spencer adds, “Other vessels are clearly shown to be in the area in the Lloyds List piece (links to PDF)), and clearly such vessels will be of interest for any subsequent inquiries that continue. This of course remains a matter for the Israeli authorities.”

____

Characteristically for Lebanon, also seeing its share of tar on the shores, blamed the dump on Israel; its Prime Minister Hassan Diab declaring “a ship of the Israeli enemy” was to blame for the oil spill that has reached Lebanon’s southern Mediterranean shores. His knee-jerk response to the spill was much different than Israel’s which called for a ban on visiting the beach, eating fish and which mobilized thousands to clean up the mess.

Greenpeace Med responded to the lack of action of Diab’s government, still in shambles after the catastrophic explosion last year that ripped Beirut apart. And the whole political cabinet quit. Officially Diab quit as well but is serving as interim PM until a new election can bring about a capable leader for the troubled country.

Greenpeace sent us this message to share about the lack of non-action by Lebanon’s leadership, hardly functioning in the good days: “We call for immediate action from the Ministry of Environment to assess the severity of this spill via an urgent survey and monitoring programme and to put in place a plan to minimize the impacts on the environment and public health.

“Based on the assessment results, the authorities should provide safety guidance to the Lebanese people especially with regards to fishing and swimming activities. This incident adds up to the long list of spills that have been threatening the rich marine biodiversity and impacting the populations of the Eastern Mediterranean region and is yet another facet of the destructive nature of our global systems’ addiction to fossil fuels.”

Future-proofing with this marine biologist who is taking inventory

We spoke with marine biologist Philip Nemoy, a post-doc researcher at the Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research before the gag order was lifted and he said that he had not yet heard from what country the oil spill tanker originated before the gag order was lifted. He didn’t think pointing blame was the right response to a catastrophe.

According to Nemoy there are tight regulations in place at sea and accidents are bound to happen as long as ships carry oil, and as long as oil rigs carry it in pipes undersea. And this all will continue as long as our hunger for oil persists.

The amount of the oil spill on Israel’s shores does not equal the Exxon Valdez, the Gulf War oil spill, or the Deepwater Horizon he says, but it has made the public and government ask itself some important questions: Who is responsible for this kind of marine disaster when it strikes?

“The threat is there and it is not going to disappear in the nearest future because we need oil transported from oil rigs in one way or another and these are prone to disaster despite all the measures and precautions taken. All those dealing with oil at sea have a lot of regulations. And they have a lot to do to avoid any spill,” Nemoy tells Green Prophet.

“I think the last spill was due to a major storm and something went bad to the ship at sea during the storm and it can happen to any ship from any country. Sometimes nature is stronger than us. We need to ask ourselves what do we need to do when we see it happening? We need to cooperate when an oil spill happens.

“The spill is a warning light for our society. That it is not only the government and not only the people and not only the NGOs. We are all connected together. What I can see is that the connection and the dialogue is lacking. It should be developed at good times and not in the time of troubles.”

He credited EcoOcean for the first response and noticed that the israeli society is deeply disconnected from its parts, yet he also acknowledges how “quickly we can become connected today. I see how things happened in the timeline of hours and days. Just in Haifa, hundreds had come together very quickly.”

Generally, Nemoy explains, the Middle East is a “balagan” or mess –- with a lot of hand waving and shouting. From the Former USSR, he saw this a bit during the cleanup but he also saw that even more could be done if more preparations were done in advance with deeper cooperation between the NGOs and Government groups, like there is in times of war.

“This way we can inform people what we can do. The same way we’d inform people when there is a war or earthquake. There can be a list of simple things you can do to help, or what you can do so you won’t harm yourself. Some people who went to the oil spill might have harmed themselves if they inhaled the fumes or touched the tar.”

Nemoy worked for the Environment Ministry at one point and understood that most companies don’t want to pollute the environment: “They want to carry on their business. If they did pollute it was because they did not know or did not want to know. It does not take a huge amount of money to explain to people about the consequences if they do pollute.”

In the past Nemoy worked to understand how he could commercially cultivate sponges in aquaculture effluent of fish farms at sea. “Which was difficult.”

Currently he is building a nationwide database, crowdsourced, to quantify marine life with environmental and commercial usefulness. Had the database been already ready, he’d have been able to tell organizations like EcoOcean where to focus efforts.

With his eyes wide open he has yet to hear of any cleanup efforts from nearby Gaza, Egypt or Lebanon to the North. “I’ve heard nothing. Nothing in Gaza. Nothing in Lebanon. Maybe it’s my bubble – I know nothing about what happens north of Rosh Hanikra and nothing from Ashkelon to the South. I would be more than happy to take a bus of 100 other volunteers and coordinate clean up efforts outside of Israel,” he says. If you’d like to cooperate with him reach out via email [email protected]

National Geographic Explorer and Marine Geo-archaeologist Beverly Goodman, works on the bay at Haifa University. She tells Green Prophet: “It’s really disheartening: none of the plans made were applied- the NGOs and local districts were left to mostly left to handle it. Apparently the spill was recognized even before the storm and models were run predicting this outcome- yet no response until it hit the beaches,” she tells Green Prophet.

Authorities have since banned the sale of all Mediterranean seafood and fish which will put a strain on local fisherman, and locals who line up for fish before holidays and the Friday night meal. Ramadan is coming soon, in April, and no one knows when it might be possible to eat local fish again.

A matter of faith?

Eco-Rabbi Yonatan Neril, who has written an ecology-inspired Eco-Bible, has to admit that “we are deeply embedded in an oil-based lifestyle” and for that “we are both victims and perpetrators of oil spills. But at this time of empowered living, we can claim our power and actively steer our collective destiny away from the profit motives of politicians and companies,” he tells Green Prophet.

Comparing the autopsy of the beached whale from last week, with its body full of oil, to our spiritual position at present, Neril provides an analogy, and a solution which is within reach of all of our nets:

“Each of us is Jonah inside the whale, whose belly and lungs have had enough of petroleum. We do not need to wait until someone rescues us—or until we run out of fossil fuels—since God is both warning and empowering us now to take steps as individuals, communities, and nations to liberate ourselves of this addiction and live fossil free,” says Neril.

“Faith leaders and communities can join together to promote a swift transition to renewable energy and toward reducing our use of energy,” he concludes.

The oil spill in Mauritius was not the only one in 2020.
Neither would the resignation of any Mauritian politician as a result of the scandalous handling of the oil spill.","unaddressed, devastation, mauritius, action, happened, shipping, mol, oil, spill, wakashio, tonnes, mauritiuss",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"Mauritius is known to most people as a popular holiday destination because of its gorgeous beaches, volcanic rocks, its fragile ecosystems of mangrove forests, coral atolls, underwater coral reefs, seagrass, and historic forts. But in early 2020, the tourism industry – a key sector in the Mauritian economy – was hit hard due to the outbreak of COVID-19, hurting the livelihoods of a large part of the local population. And what happened several months later completely devastated the island nation.

On July 25, the Japanese vessel MV Wakashio, transiting too close to Mauritius, crashed into one of its most fragile coral reefs. On August 6, it began leaking fuel, which turned out to be a new type of highly toxic heavy oil. Before the leak was stopped, about 1,000 tonnes of oil had seeped into the Indian Ocean, severely contaminating Mauritius’s shoreline and lagoons in what would become the worst environmental disaster that the country had ever known.

Tens of thousands of people who volunteered for the clean-up, including members of local fishing communities, were exposed to the toxic components of the oil spill, which damaged the island’s food system and degraded its attractiveness for tourism. Three sailors died and one went missing while towing a barge carrying oil from the wreck. More than 50 whales and dolphins washed up dead on the island’s shores; the government is yet to release the full details of the autopsies of the animals which would confirm whether their deaths were caused by the oil spill.

In the months since the tragedy struck Mauritius, instead of ensuring full transparency over the fallout of the oil spill and taking urgent steps to ensure it does not repeat, the government, the Japanese corporation, and international organisations that got involved have withheld crucial information from the public.

Today, uncertainty about Mauritius recovery persists, while no major action has been taken to protect the island’s waters from a future incident.

No comprehensive information has been made publicly available on why the Wakashio ran aground, on the possible impact of the oil spill on people’s health and on nature, or on why the front section of the vessel was sunk into a whale’s nursing ground. Questions have also remained about the completion of oil fingerprinting – an important process that would provide conservationists with important insight into the effect of the oil spill on marine life.

The government has also done little to make sure another oil spill does not happen. Mauritius’s coastline is vulnerable to damage by international maritime activities and it is a risk that must not be tolerated given their ecological, socioeconomic and scientific significance.

One of the steps the government could take in that direction is to create a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) with the help of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A PSSA would establish an area which ships would have to avoid. This would help the authorities preserve the biodiversity hotspots in Mauritius’s waters and ensure a safer route for the shipping industry.

Such PSSAs should be established not just in Mauritius but in other areas around the world to protect marine life and the livelihoods of local people. They should be an integral part of the strategy to protect 30 percent of the planet’s oceans and land by 2030, which will be negotiated at this year’s United Nations Biodiversity Conference to be held in Kunming, China.

Greenpeace has already publicly called on Mauritius’s government to take action and create a PSSA. The same was suggested even by the IMO, recognising the urgent need for greater protection. Yet the government remains silent about what has happened since the MV Wakashio ran aground and about its plans to ensure such an oil spill never happens again.

The companies involved in the incident have also been slow to take full responsibility for what happened and take appropriate action. The MV Wakashio was owned by Japanese company Okiyo Maritime Corp, a subsidiary of Nagashiki Shipping, and was operated by Mitsui OSK Lines (MoL), one of the world’s largest shipping companies.

After the oil spill, MoL rushed to publish an apology letter, but that did not curb the public outrage that ensued in Mauritius and Japan. Mauritius had some of the largest protests in its history demanding urgent action and compensation. In Japan, tens of thousands signed petitions demanding MoL and Nagashiki Shipping take responsibility, make funds available for the people of Mauritius and divest from fossil fuels. Greenpeace Japan continues to engage with the companies over these demands.

But corporate responsibility should go beyond MoL and Nagashiki Shipping. While shipped goods are an integral part of modern life and the global trade system, the shipping sector, which is a significant polluter and source of greenhouse gases, remains entirely out of touch with contemporary political, social and ecological priorities.

Unlike other branches of the global economy, shipping has quietly excluded itself from the Paris Agreement. That is not because there are no solutions for a transition towards renewable energy within the sector, but rather because the shipping industry has simply been let off the hook for too long. As Mauritian development economist Nishan Degnarain wrote in a recent article for Forbes: “shipping remains one of the most dangerous industries in the world – not because of the conditions of the ocean – but the conduct of the regulators and operators”.

The oil spill in Mauritius was not the only one in 2020. Venezuela’s Morrocoy National Park suffered from a massive leak from a nearby refinery, which released about 3,000 tonnes of oil. More than 20,000 tonnes of diesel leaked from a collapsed fuel tank near the city of Norilsk in Russia’s Arctic north, causing massive pollution of freshwater. In Canada, roughly 140 tonnes of oil was spilled at Sumas Pump Station in Canada’s British Columbia province over fields covering the aquifer that the Sumas First Nation use for drinking water; that was the fourth time the pipeline has spilled near the reservation in the last 15 years.

Oil spills always attract international media’s attention for a few days at best and then are forgotten, but people and nature in those affected areas take decades to heal. Some losses for Mauritius’s economy and biodiversity might never be recovered.

While an apology and compensation by MoL is welcome, it cannot change what has happened. Neither would the resignation of any Mauritian politician as a result of the scandalous handling of the oil spill.

These would be empty gestures unless lessons are learned from what happened and the seas around Mauritius are protected. While taking action to prevent future oil spills, corporations and governments must also accelerate their divestment from fossil fuels. A growing movement of citizens is rising up in Africa and across the world to demand action. Their voices must be heard.

Cause for concern: Furnace oil that leaked from Travancore Titanium Products deposited at the adjoining beach, in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday.

Clean-up work begins along the coast near Kerala capital

An emergency clean-up was launched along the coast on Wednesday to mitigate the fallout of a furnace oil leak into the sea from the Kerala government undertaking Travancore Titanium Products Ltd. (TTP) at Kochuveli near the State capital.

TTP officials put the spillage, caused by a rupture in a pipeline carrying the furnace oil, at roughly 5,000 litres. After the alarm was raised in the morning, the district administration declared the coastal stretches along Shanghumughom, Vettucaud, and Veli off-limits to the public and tourists for two days.

Fishing banned

Fishing activities along these regions also stand banned as a precautionary measure, District Collector Navjot Khosa said.

Local residents, largely comprising the fishing community, have expressed outrage over the oil leak, blaming the TTP for negligence. They alleged that the oil leak would have a prolonged impact on marine resources, and consequently, their livelihood.

The leakage occurred around 7 a.m., but it had gone unnoticed at the time. The oil spilled out into a drain that opens out into the nearby beach, contaminating the beach and coastal waters. The leak was promptly plugged once the alarm was raised around 8 a.m., TTP officials said.

Probe ordered

Dr. Khosa, who visited TTP and the affected coastal stretch, said the situation was under control. She has ordered an investigation by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB). The PCB study will also cover the possible fallout of the oil leak. On its part, the TTP too has ordered an internal investigation. A preliminary survey has revealed that the oil spill is largely confined to near-shore waters and the beach. As a troubleshooting measure, the topsoil along the affected stretch of coast would be removed, the collector said.

The Indian Coast Guard is closely monitoring the situation using a ship and a Dornier aircraft. “The ICG Dornier aircraft arrived immediately from Kochi for aerial survey and ensured that no oil spill was found inside the sea. The ICG is closely monitoring the situation and equipped with all logistics in case the oil spill spreads to the sea owing to tidal movements,” the ICG said in a statement.

The leak was reportedly discovered by fishers in the densely populated neighbourhood on Wednesday morning. The fishing community has demanded urgent measures to clean up the beach and the coastal waters. They fear that the oil leak will have a prolonged impact on fishing activities unless prompt measures are initiated."

By Isabelle Gerretsen

Over six months ago, Japanese cargo ship MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef off the coast of Mauritius, leaking up to 1,000 tonnes of heavy oil into a pristine lagoon.

The oil spill has been described as one of the worst ecological disasters ever to hit the western Indian Ocean. It has devastated the livelihoods of local fishermen and tour operators, who were already struggling to stay afloat due to the coronavirus pandemic, campaigners on the ground say.

Shipping and ocean experts told Climate Home News that the incident has raised serious concerns about the safety of the fuel used on board the Wakashio and its long-term environmental impacts. More vessels could fail and cause marine pollution if the lessons of the disaster are not learned, they warned.

Yet the Mauritian government, Japanese ship owner Nagashiki Shipping and fuel supplier BP are withholding crucial information that could aid clean-up efforts and prevent future shipwrecks.

An envoy from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) downplayed the environmental threat, saying the leaked fuel was “just like skin cream”.

“It begs the question whether the shipping industry is really holding itself to greater accountability on the product that it uses,” Yuvan Beejadhur, a former blue economy expert at the World Bank and coordinator of citizen movements in Mauritius, told Climate Home News.

The fuel

In January 2020, the IMO – the UN body responsible for international shipping – introduced a sulphur cap, banning ships from using marine fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5%.

This measure to protect public health from sulphur oxide emissions led to the oil industry developing a wide range of very low sulphur fuel oils (VLSFOs).

VLSFOs are cheap, blended fuels made from residue oil, the dregs at the bottom of the barrel, and more refined products, such as gasoline or diesel.

When VLSFOs started being used in January 2020, very little was known about them, according to Dr Sian Prior, lead advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance. “Nothing on levels of air pollution when they were burned, nothing on how they reacted if spilled and nothing on the environmental impact,” she told Climate Home News.

In 2020 several studies were published which indicate that VLSFOs are far from green. Although they emit significantly less sulphur when burned than other marine fuels, they cause higher black carbon emissions because they contain a large number of aromatic compounds, according to a study by the German Environment Agency, seen by Climate Home.

Besides the emissions they produce, there are also concerns about how VLSFOs react with water.

Two weeks after the Wakashio grounding, the IMO sent representative Matthew Sommerville to provide technical advice and assist with the clean up. In comments to reporters in Mauritius, Sommerville described the spilled VLSFO as “not really black thick oil… It’s just like skin cream.”

“It goes away. It’s not the end of the world – it cleans. Look how easily it is cleaning off. It could have been a lot worse if it had been a different type of oil,” he said.

When asked by Climate Home News if the IMO backed this characterisation of VLSFO, spokesperson Nathasha Brown said: “We will wait for the full report to see [if there are] any lessons to be learned.”

Experts disagree with Sommerville’s assessment and say that VLSFO has similar characteristics to traditional heavy fuel oil (HFO), a viscous oil which solidifies quickly in water, making it incredibly difficult to clean up.

A 2020 study by Norwegian marine research institution SINTEF found that VLSFO has a similar composition to HFO when spilled in water. “The oils tested indicate a high degree of persistence on the sea surface,” the SINTEF researchers said, adding that “the oil spill response can be even more challenging” than in the case of traditional fuel oil, such as HFO, particularly in cold water.

A report seen by Climate Home by the International Standards Organization, which will be discussed at an IMO meeting in March, also classes VLSFO as an HFO based on its density.

“It can be concluded that the vast majority of VLSFOs would fall under the definition of HFO in the HFO ban approved by MEPC 75,” the report noted, citing the decision by the IMO’s environmental committee in November to restrict HFO use in Arctic waters.

In late August, a month after the Wakashio ran aground, dead dolphins started washing up on Mauritius’ shores. A spokesperson for the fisheries ministry attributed the deaths to shark attacks, telling Reuters that the dolphins had wounds and blood around their jaws, “no trace of oil however.” Environmental groups called on the government to conduct an autopsy. To date the results of the autopsy remain unknown.

“The dolphins, whales and porpoises that died – it’s still not been explained whether it was caused by sulphur fuel. No results have been communicated,” said Beejadhur.

Beejadhur said many of the long-term environmental impacts of VLSFO have not been thoroughly assessed, despite the fact that the fuel is now widely used within the industry.

The shipwreck

According to the Wakashio’s owner, Nagashiki, the ship ran aground because the crew was sailing too close to the shore and was not aware of safety procedures.

“There was a lack of awareness of the dangers of navigating close to the coast… and insufficient implementation of regulations that must be observed in order to safely execute voyages,” the company said in a statement.

But experts say that VLSFO has been linked to engine wear and could have caused the engine of the Wakashio to fail. No assessment of the condition of the engine has been made public.

Sulphur has some lubricating qualities and if it is removed from the fuel, engines can get stuck, Branko Berlan, the representative for the International Transport Federation at the IMO, told Climate Home News.

If operators don’t use other acidic lubricants, similar to sulphur, abrasive calcium deposits can build up inside the engine cylinders which could ultimately lead to engine wear or failure, according to a report by fuel testing company Veritas Petroleum Services (VPS), seen by Climate Home. VPS said in May it had identified over 40 ships that had experienced major engine damage since they started using VLSFO in January 2020.

Part of the problem is that operators do not know what type of fuel they are handling and how to ensure it is safe to use on board their ships, according to Berlan. “Exact procedures and involved substances are unknown. You never know what you are receiving as there is no regulation around quality,” he said.

“Any petroleum-based fuel oil has potential safety risks. Ship engineers and ship masters need to be aware of potential safety issues with the fuel they use and have to manage any risks,” said the IMO’s Brown, adding that safety guidance was issued before ships started using VLSFO.

“Through 2020, and into 2021 to date, [the] IMO has not received any reports of safety issues linked to VLSFO,” Brown said.

The missing sample

One of the biggest omissions from the investigation into the Wakashio grounding is that fuel from onboard the ship was never tested by independent analysts.

In September, Mauritius’ ministry of environment said it had asked the Australian Maritime Safety Agency (AMSA) to carry out an independent analysis of a fuel sample from the Wakashio.

AMSA told Forbes in January that it never received a fuel sample from BP, the oil company that supplied the fuel used by the Wakashio.

BP said it has analysed the fuel but has not publicly disclosed the chemical composition.

The fuel on board the Wakashio “fully met the specified standard that is recognised across the international bunkering industry,” BP said in a statement. BP said that the fuel was also tested by Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), a subsidiary of Nagashiki Shipping and the company that chartered the Wakashio.

“MOL raised no concerns about the quality of the oil, nor have the operators of seven other vessels that received the same fuel,” BP said. A spokesperson did not respond to follow-up questions about why BP did not supply a sample to AMSA as requested.

But experts say much remains unknown about VLSFO and it is critical samples from the Wakashio are analysed to avoid future disasters and help Mauritius recover from this oil spill.

“It’s paramount to know the oil’s chemical composition so you can tailor the best and most successful response. You don’t have an idea of the compounds in there. [They] dictate how toxic [the spill] may be,” according to Chris Reddy, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who has analysed major oil spills, including the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.

“Knowledge about this spill could help us inform how things may play out in Mauritius,” Reddy told Climate Home News. He and his team analysed a sample of floating fuel residue, collected on 16 August.

“We don’t know if this was a low-sulphur material, but it’s unlike anything we’ve seen spilled before—that alone demands a closer look,” Reddy said after analysing the sample in October.

“We didn’t get the original product from the ship. A sample was collected from the beach and was a week or two old. Based on experience, it changed a little [compared to] the spilled fuel oil.” Reddy told Climate Home News.

Unanswered questions

“Today, uncertainty about Mauritius recovery persists, while no major action has been taken to protect the island’s waters from a future incident,” climate campaigners wrote in an Al Jazeera article this month.

“No results have been communicated,” said Beejadhur, adding that the IMO and government investigators have had little engagement with local fishermen, whose livelihoods have been destroyed by the oil spill.

Campaigners are critical of the meagre compensation offered to affected communities. The government set up a “Wakashio solidarity grant” for around 3,000 people, offering them a one-time pay out of Rs 20,000 ($500), according to activist group Rezistans ek Alternativ.

According to maritime law, the ship owner is responsible for damage caused by an oil spill. That means Nagashiki Shipping is liable. Nagashiki said in July that it would “deal with compensation claims based on applicable laws”.

Due to a technicality, that compensation could be capped at $18 million, regardless of the scale of the damage.

To date no payout has been made and it remains unclear how far the compensation negotiations have progressed. Mauritius’ ministry of the blue economy, marine resources, fisheries and shipping did not respond to Climate Home’s questions regarding the insurance claim.

Mauritians worry that they will be left to deal with the recovery from the devastating oil spill themselves.

“The saddest fact is if we go back to normal and people forget about the Wakashio crisis,” said Beejadhur."

A glass furnace pipeline ruptured and oil leaked into the sea at the Travancore Titanium Products factory in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The incident took place around 1 am on Wednesday.

A study by the Pollution Control Board found oil spilled up to two kilometers into the sea. Following this, the government has imposed a temporary ban for the public and tourists to the major tourist destinations in Thiruvananthapuram district, Veli and Shankhumugham beaches. The Coast Guard is also monitoring the incident.

Fishermen said that the black furnace oil spilt into the two kilometres of the sea. They expressed their deep concern to local MLA VS Sivakumar, Titanium factory officials and the other representatives who reached the spot.

The fishermen said that a lot of fishes and sea turtles have been found dead on the seashore. They also demanded compensation from the government as are unable to fish while the oil is spilled in the sea.

Titanium factory officials said a leak in the pipeline was immediately discovered and closed. Currently, there is no oil leak. Efforts are being made to remove the furnace oil from the sea as soon as possible.

A team of officials led by Thiruvananthapuram District Collector Navjot Khosa visited the oil spilled areas. The collector said the source of the oil leak was detected and closed quickly and this prevented the spreading of the oil into the sea on a large scale.

The Pollution Control Board is in discussions with experts regarding the removal of oil spills off the coast, the district collector said.

Preliminary reports from the Coast Guard indicate that a large amount of oil has not been dumped into the sea due to the low tide. Instead, the spilled oil has spread along the coast. Apart from this, it has also mixed with the coastal soil.

The district collector said oily topsoil will be removed from the area soon. Currently, the oil is spread from the coastline of Vettukadu to Veli.

Titanium factory will use the excavators to move the oily topsoil to their own land, then will remove and dilute the oil with an oil neutraliser.

The company has been strictly instructed to complete this expeditiously. The oily soil will be removed from densely populated coastal areas first.

Disaster Management Division Deputy Collector GK Suresh Kumar inspected the factory and instructed the company to immediately remove the oil that spread in the area."

A study published in Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry has found long-term impacts of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico on bottlenose dolphins' immune function.



Bottlenose dolphins from an area that received prolonged and heavy oiling were temporarily captured, sampled, and released as part of health assessment programs. The animals were compared with dolphins from an area where no oil was observed.



Investigators documented immunological alterations in bottlenose dolphins tested up to a decade following the oil spill that were similar in nature to those immediately following the spill. The effects were seen even in dolphins born after the spill. The nature of the immunological effects observed in dolphins were also similar to those in mice experimentally exposed to oil in the lab.



The findings suggest that there are long-term consequences of oil exposure on the mammalian immune system, with possible multigenerational effects.



""The parallel between findings in dolphins exposed following the Deepwater Horizon spill and laboratory mice experimentally exposed to oil was impressive and really helped build the weight of evidence between oil exposure and specific effects on the immune system,"" said corresponding author Sylvain De Guise, PhD, of the University of Connecticut. ""However, the long-term effects and potential for multigenerational effects raise significant concerns for the recovery of dolphin populations following the spill,"" he added.

Like many who have witnessed the environmental impact of multinational oil companies in the Niger Delta, we welcomed two recent ground-breaking rulings in the UK Supreme Court and the Dutch appeals court. Both cases signal a shift in the onus of responsibility. It now lies firmly at the feet of multinationals who have prospered, profited, and polluted in the Niger Delta.

In the case heard in the Netherlands in January, the appeals court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell was responsible for environmental pollution by its subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. By failing to introduce effective tracking devices, the judgment said Royal Dutch Shell was culpable for oil pipeline leaks and ordered it to pay unspecified damages to farmers. In the UK, the court overturned a previous ruling and said that similar cases against Shell could be heard in British courts.

Among many others, the Bayelsa State Oil and Environmental Commission has long called for multinational oil companies to be held to account for damage caused by their operations in Nigeria. The environmental impact has been profound. Around 40 million litres of oil are spilled across the Niger Delta each year, according to the Rise for Bayelsa campaign. This has led to devastating pollution that could take 30 years to clean up and shocking health threats for people living in the area. In one community in western Ogoniland, drinking wells were found to be contaminated with levels of benzene, a known carcinogen, at 900 times the World Health Organisation’s guidelines.

For far too long, multinationals operating in the Niger Delta have been able to shirk their responsibilities for this devastation. They have done so by accusing members of the local populations of sabotaging pipelines or blaming their local subsidiaries for negligence in maintaining infrastructure. It appears that these days may soon be over. Following three decades of tireless efforts from hundreds of thousands of people in the Niger Delta and environmental campaigners, both the Dutch and UK courts rightly acknowledged that Shell shares responsibility with its subsidiary.

These rulings are ground-breaking and pave the way for more communities to access justice in international jurisdictions. They are a clear indictment of the duplicitous activity of multinationals for decades. No longer can oil companies hide behind technicalities. They must take responsibility for the operations of their foreign subsidiaries.

No time to waste

At a time when many oil multinationals are claiming to invest in renewables and present themselves as “green”, it is more urgent than ever to ensure that they are not let off the hook for the environmental damage that decades of extractive activities have left in their wake. This is particularly urgent as these impacts are most strongly felt by poor people and are part of what some have labelled “environmental racism”. If nothing is done, generations will continue to struggle with coping with the aftereffects of oil and gas-related pollution.

As our chair, former Archbishop of York John Sentamu, said in 2019, distance does not diminish responsibility. Too many corporations take liberties in remote parts of the world, behaving in ways that would be deemed illegal in the West by foisting the responsibility on local subsidiaries. This practice must stop and the courts have rightly ruled that there is a clear chain of responsibility, from multinational to subsidiary.

It is now time to right the wrongs of the past. Multinationals must compensate affected villages, restore land, and ensure that, whether they are operating in Nigeria or Norway, they hold themselves to the same standards and levels of accountability and responsibility.

At the Bayelsa State Oil and Environmental Commission (BSOEC), we have witnessed first-hand the environmental devastation and human toll that over 60 years of poorly regulated oil and gas production in the Niger Delta have wrought. We know from collecting over 500 testimonies and gathering evidence from polluted sites across the region that there is no time to waste."

The spill was caused by an oil tanker that was carrying pirated cargo from Iran to Syria last month, Israeli Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel said.

The vessel sailed through the Gulf and the Red Sea without radio contact, switching its tracking devices back on before passing through Egypt’s Suez Canal, Gamliel told reporters.

It turned the devices off again before entering Israeli waters in the eastern Mediterranean, and dropped oil into the sea between Feb. 1-2, she said, naming the vessel as the Panama-flagged oil tanker Emerald.

“Iran is (conducting) terrorism by damaging the environment, and (when) Iran is damaging the environment it isn’t just hurting the state of Israel,” Gamliel said.

There was no immediate comment from Iran.

The accusation is the second in a week in which Israel has blamed its long-time enemy Iran of wrongdoing at sea.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Tehran for an explosion aboard an Israeli-owned ship in the Gulf of Oman last week, an accusation rejected by Tehran.

Tensions have risen in the Gulf region since the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers.

ECOLOGICAL DISASTER

The oil spill blackened beaches up and down the Israeli coast, and clumps of sticky black tar have washed up on the shores of south Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, as well.

Environmental groups are calling it an ecological disaster that could take years to clean up.

Gamliel said the vessel was “owned and operated by a Libyan”, without identifying a person or company.

Libya’s state-owned shipping firm, the General National Maritime Transport Company, said it had owned the vessel but sold it at an auction in December.

The vessel was purchased by Emerald Marine Ltd, a company based in the Marshall Islands, according to the shipping database Equasis. Reuters was not immediately able to reach the company for comment.

Gamliel said the vessel turned its tracking devices back on again upon reaching Syria on Feb. 3, where she said it unloaded crude oil. It then returned to Iran, where it is currently anchored, she said.

Refinitiv ship tracking data showed the vessel reported a destination of Sohar in Oman, across the Gulf of Oman from Iran, on Jan. 20, meaning it was around Iran’s coast at that time.

The ship tracking data did not show any destinations in Iran, though it is common for vessels to conceal their movements there.

The vessel reported its position after passing through the Suez Canal on Feb. 1, Refinitiv data showed. It next reported its position with a destination of Mersin in Turkey on Feb. 3, showing a gap between Feb. 1 and 3.

The vessel did not report any destinations in Syria, though it is also common for ships to conceal movements there.

An international convention requires merchant ships to have a satellite tracking device on board when travelling at sea. But a ship’s captain has the discretion to switch the transponder off under certain circumstances, enabling them to avoid detection.

The Israeli environmental protection ministry said it had collected strong “circumstantial evidence” that this was the ship behind the spill, though it did not have “forensic evidence”. It said it also ruled out any other source."

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities said Wednesday that a Libyan-owned tanker suspected of smuggling oil from Iran to Syria was responsible for spilling tons of crude into the eastern Mediterranean last month, causing one of Israel’s worst environmental disasters.

Over 90% of Israel’s 195 kilometer (120-mile) Mediterranean coastline was covered in more than 1,000 tons of black tar, the result of the mysterious oil spill in international waters.

The ecological disaster, one of the worst in the country’s history, has caused extensive damage and forced the closure of beaches and a ban on the sale of seafood from the Mediterranean.

Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel said the Panamanian-flagged “pirate ship owned by a Libyan company” — identified as the “Emerald” — filled its stores with oil in the Persian Gulf, then sailed with its transmitters off toward the coast of Syria.

Ministry officials said it is believed to have dumped its oil in the eastern Mediterranean, around 70 kilometers (40 miles) off the coast of Israel, on Feb. 1 or 2.

The ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com listed the owner as the General National Maritime Transport Co. The company, which describes itself as Libyan state-owned with a fleet of 22 vessels, did not respond to messages left after working hours.

But the U.N.-run International Maritime Organization said that as of late December 2020, the Emerald came under new ownership. It lists the active owner as Emerald Marine Ltd., which is registered in the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands Maritime and Corporate Administrators did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Rani Amir, one of the ministry’s lead investigators into the incident, said “strong circumstantial evidence” pointed to the Emerald’s involvement, and that it was believed to be involved in smuggling oil to Syria in breach of international sanctions.

“We don’t think it had another aim,” he said. “The aim was to smuggle oil illegally from Iran to Syria.”

Amir said the spill could have been either an accident or a deliberate act of terrorism.

Iranian oil tankers increasingly have been accused of smuggling oil out of the country and selling the lucrative crude abroad after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers nearly three years ago. Trump reimposed sweeping sanctions on the country, including on its oil sector, a main source of income for Tehran.

In 2019, the U.K. seized an Iranian oil tanker suspected of violating European Union sanctions on oil shipments to Syria, setting off a series of confrontations. Iranian tankers sometimes turn off their identification system, making them difficult to track.

Gamliel, however, called the incident a deliberate act of “environmental terror” and blamed Iran. Gamliel, a junior minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, provided no evidence to support that theory.

“We will sue for compensation for all citizens of Israel,” she said at a press conference.

Gamliel’s spokesman declined requests for clarification, and Israel’s military and defense and foreign ministries could not confirm the claim.

Iranian officials did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.

Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry had kept the particulars of its investigation into the incident under close guard and obtained a court issued gag-order on all details about the case.

Globules of tar first started appearing on Israel’s coastline on Feb. 19 after a winter storm drove the slick to shore. Tar has also coated parts of Lebanon’s coastline.

The oil spill’s impact on the ecosystem has yet to be fully assessed, but ecologists and environmental groups estimate the damage is extensive.

Last month the ministry allocated 45 million shekels ($13 million) to the clean-up project, which is projected to take months. The sea has continued to dredge up tar onto Israel’s beaches almost two weeks after the disaster hit.

Thirty years ago Wednesday, on March 3, 1991, the Line 3 oil pipeline ruptured in Grand Rapids, Minn., spilling 1.7 million gallons of crude oil onto the frozen Prairie River.

It's still the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history.

Because the river was covered with ice, crews were able to keep the oil from reaching the Mississippi, 2 miles away.

""There would be people on the ice, squeegeeing oil on top of the ice, which was weird, everything was weird, it was like some kind of gross landscape,” Scott Hall, a reporter for Grand Rapids public radio station KAXE, told MPR News in 2018 for an episode of its Rivers of Oil podcast, which dove deep into the impacts of the spill.

“And so they had hoses going down, and just sucking as much oil as they could out into these tanker trucks.""

About 50 people gathered at the Prairie River on the 30th anniversary of the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. On March 3, 1991, a pipeline owned by the Lakehead Pipeline Co. ruptured, spilling about 1.7 million gallons of crude oil. Kirsti Marohn | MPR News

The Lakehead Pipeline Co. owned Line 3, which was built in the 1960s to carry oil from Canada, at the time of the spill. And the company that succeeded Lakehead, Enbridge Energy, is now replacing that same Line 3 with a new pipeline along a different route across the state.

Construction on the new line began in earnest in December. But Native American tribes and environmental groups continue to fight the $4 billion project, on the ground and in court.

At least 50 people gathered at the Prairie River near the spill site in Grand Rapids Wednesday. Law enforcement issued citations to dozens of protesters after they blocked traffic on U.S. Highway 2.

Protesters say the 1991 spill is an indicator of the risk that oil pipelines pose to Minnesota waters.

Enbridge argues that the aging Line 3 needs to be replaced, and improvements in monitoring technology and operations in the past 30 years have greatly improved safety.

Rivers of Oil, episode 2: The largest inland spill

Rivers of Oil is a podcast produced by MPR News in 2018. It’s a look at how the pipelines beneath our feet, from Keystone XL to Dakota Access to Line 3, have come to the forefront of an epic tug of war between reliance and risk — and how we all have a role to play in this story.

It took years to clean up after an oil pipeline burst, gushing 1.7 million gallons of crude onto the landscape near Grand Rapids, in 1991. Here, crews clean up along on an area river -- a week after the spill. Screengrab from video shot by Harry Hutchins

Harry Hutchins had grand hopes for a 16-acre patch of land near a community college in Grand Rapids, Minn.

It was the late 1980s, and Hutchins was a teacher at the school. He wanted to return the plot from farmland back to its natural wetland state. The idea was to use the marsh as a sort of living laboratory for his students.

It took two years of work, but Hutchins finally got approval to make the plot a wetland again.

Then, on March 3, 1991: A phone call. ""A friend of mine, he called me up and said, 'Harry you won't believe this, but your wetland is filled with oil,'"" Hutchins recalled this year.

A pipeline rupture had gushed 1.7 million gallons of crude oil across the landscape, filling Hutchins' wetland with the black mess.

""It just covered these aspen trees, because it went up 30, 40 feet,"" he recalled. ""It was quite a geyser.""

It remains the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history.

The pipe that ruptured was Enbridge Energy's Line 3, which carries crude oil across northern Minnesota. Today, Enbridge is building a new Line 3 along a different route across the state, and its plan is prompting vigorous debate — partly focused on the fear of spills.

Perspective is everything: The energy industry points out that nearly all the oil transported in pipelines reaches its destination safely. From the industry's point of view, 99.999 percent of the oil they transport is transported safely.

But that leaves the other .001 percent. And that's the percentage that people in areas where pipes have leaked care about.

This story isn't just about the risks of transporting huge amounts of oil through pipelines. It's also about the reward that oil provides. Because cheap, easy access to oil powers our society in ways we don't even think about. It's not just in our gas tanks — it's in the roads we drive on, our kids' plastic toys, our makeup.

In this episode of Rivers of Oil, we examine the fear of spills from oil pipelines, through the lens of the fight over Line 3, the plan that has the potential to be the next place where we see mass protests over pipelines.

As people who are fighting Line 3 like to point out, oil, and water — they don't mix. Listen to the full episode.

Tar in the Mediterranean following a devastating oil spill in February 2021.
It is defined by international standards as a Tier 2 oil spill,” Rosenblum, the director of Ecoocean, tells NoCamels.","sea, tar, israel, wakeup, beaches, environmental, say, better, happen, mediterranean, oil, spill, ngos, rosenblum, israeli, conservation",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"Environmental groups in Israel are warning that a massive oil spill last month is a trailer of what’s to come if government plans for an oil pipeline deal set for the Red Sea port of Eilat materialize. The spill has continued to wash up clumps of tar along over 90 percent of the country’s 195-kilometer Mediterranean coastline, devastating beaches, killing wildlife, and reaching as far up as neighboring Lebanon.

“This is one of the worst ecological disasters we have ever experienced,” Maya Jacobs, CEO of Zalul environmental NGO that is dedicated to the protection of the seas and rivers of Israel, tells NoCamels. “And this is like a promo. This is nothing compared to what could happen to us. We have nature calling us, saying wake up, look what you’re doing.”

The extent of the devastation of the current spill is still unknown as it is likely to take months to cleanup. Early photos of black blobs of oily tar covering sandy beaches and rocks along the coastline, and shocking images of tar-blackened sea turtles, birds, a young whale and fish killed in the ecological disaster, show a glimpse of the damage wreaked by the oil spill that seems to have taken place in early February.

The spill at sea, which seems to have been accidental and not eco-terrorism as first claimed by the Israeli government, only became known when the crude first washed ashore on February 17. According to European Maritime Safety Agency satellite images and local lab tests, the spill took place 50 kilometers (31 miles) offshore, opposite the city of Ashdod.

For the NGOs working to save the sea and keep it healthy, how the spill came to be is less critical than making sure it doesn’t happen again.

“There is no emergency preparedness,” says Jacobs.

NGOs want the government to finally pass a law “that would define what everyone needs to do in case there’s an oil spill,” says Arik Rosenblum, director of Ecoocean, an NGO focused on evidence-based marine conservation for Israel and the region. Rosenblum is referring to the fact that Israel, a sea-hugging nation, lacks a national plan for Preparedness and Response to Marine Oil Pollution Incidents.

In 2008, there was a cabinet decision to buy needed equipment to be able to respond to oil spills at sea. But the Treasury blocked funding of the decision and the law never came about. Over the years, environmental activists and NGOs have held “demonstrations, potential petitions, lobbying, going to court,” says Rosenblum, “to try to get the situation to be changed, and it didn’t help.”

He says the work of the NGOs is paramount, but the government must act, too.

“Our whole being is to try to protect the sea. And it’s sort of like having to watch our child being in an endangered place. And we can’t help them as much as we’d like to,” says Rosenblum. “We’re proud that our tiny little NGO, which has worked 24/7 for at least 10 days, has been able to do something to reduce the danger of the sea, but it’s not over.”

The current spill has pushed the government into renewed action. On February 23, the cabinet approved a plan to allocate NIS 45 million to treat the pollution of the beaches, remove the waste to disposal sites and try to restore the situation to what it had been previously.

“This was a major ecological disaster in which a thousand tons of petroleum and tar were piled up on our beaches. We must act quickly, before it sinks into the ground, especially in rocky areas and this would be damage that would be with us for many years. Therefore, we are acting quickly and have just approved the plan …this budgetary assistance will help in saving our beaches. We will maintain our beaches and our environment,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.

“We will do everything so that we will be able to repair the ecological damage and go back to enjoying Israel’s beautiful beaches, and open the coming bathing season on schedule,” Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel said in a statement.

Indeed, many of the beaches that were first closed upon news of the oil spill have since been given a government green light to reopen to the public.

But not all the beaches are unpolluted. Thousands of volunteers are still cleaning up local beaches covered with more than 12,000 tonnes of tar, and the cleanup is expected to last for several more months due to its atrociousness.

“Most of the cleaning has been focused on the sandy areas of the beaches. And now the focus is on the rocky terrain, which needs much more expertise. We’ve trained volunteers and for the next four months, we’ll be working on it,” Rosenblum tells NoCamels.

The new government funding is meant to be divvied up to local authorities and the Nature and Parks Authority, to treat the polluted beaches. Some funds will go to transporting, treating and removing the waste tar from the temporary storage sites on the beaches to designated sites.

And other funds will be used to carry out surveys and studies to monitor and document the scope and magnitude of the damage, the rehabilitation process and evaluate how to repair the maritime environment.

The cabinet also called to establish a committee to recommend ways to deal with and prevent maritime disaster scenarios, including the necessary budgets and personnel.

The question now is whether this new call to establish a committee, within six months, to deal with and prevent future maritime disaster scenarios is lip service or not.

The NGOs reiterate the government’s parallel plans to turn Israel’s southernmost city into an oil and gas import and export hub.

“This is a catastrophe but it’s not being compared to what we can expect if we don’t act now,” says Jacobs, whose organization campaigns for marine preservation.

The activists warn that it is just a matter of time before a leak occurs at the offshore natural gas fields Tamar and Leviathan or what could happen if the preliminary deal calling for state-owned Europe Asia Pipeline Co to transport oil from the United Arab Emirates to Europe via a pipeline that connects the Red Sea city of Eilat, and the port city of Ashkelon goes through.

“Oil spills happen,” says Rosenblum. “There’s a statistical fact that they happen. Even those that do the best they can to prevent it. It’s still a statistical fact. You can’t ignore it. You have to prepare for it. And you have to do the best you can to make sure it doesn’t happen near our coast,” he says.

Jacobs explains that while the world is “moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy solutions, Israel is investing in the wrong direction.” She says that Israel needs to accept that it missed the boat the Age of Oil because of the Arab embargo and now focus on renewable energy resources.

“We cannot contaminate ourselves, it’s against environmental logic and also financial logic. The government is looking to invest billions and billions of our taxpayers’ money in the infrastructure for gas, despite the fact that we see already a shift of trillions of dollars in the world moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy solutions. What are we doing here? Everything is opposite than what we’re supposed to be doing,” she says.

A fossil fuel leak near Eilat could harm the world-renowned coral reefs, endanger tourism and public health.

“This is not only an Israeli problem, this is a regional problem both for the Mediterranean and all the countries around it, and also for the Red Sea. And we’re calling on all nations, all nature lovers, all coral reef lovers, the corals of the Red Sea are not immune to oil,” says Jacobs.

Rosenblum says while the current spill is the country’s worst ecological catastrophe in recent memory, a future one could return us to the Middle Ages.

“We received at least 1,200 tonnes of tar; it has reached 160 kilometers of our 195-kilometer coastline. It is defined by international standards as a Tier 2 oil spill,” Rosenblum, the director of Ecoocean, tells NoCamels.

“A Tier 3 oil spill would [force us to] shut down the desalination plants, meaning we have no drinking water, we’d have to close down the doors of the power stations, so we’d have no power. We will be back in the Middle Ages,” says Rosenblum. “We do hope this is a call to reason and a wake-up call.”

Line 3 is in fact very much like Keystone XLEnbridge also argues that the Line 3 expansion is needed to safely deliver tar sands oil and prevent leaks, because otherwise that oil would travel by train.
A 2016 report found that tar sands oil is much more difficult to clean up than non-tar sands oil.
Once the forests are cleared, a lot of the tar sands oil requires in situ mining, in which hot steam is pumped underground to help liquefy the tar sands oil so it’s ready for extraction.","stop, water, indigenousled, pipeline, explained, climate, project, expansion, sands, fight, aubid, oil, line, enbridge, minnesota",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"Tania Aubid began her hunger strike on Valentine’s Day.

“Valentine’s Day is about love and having that love for your partner — but for me to have the love, I need to start from the ground up, which is Mother Earth,” Aubid told me. Her hunger strike is in protest of the Line 3 oil pipeline project that is being built in Minnesota.

Aubid is Anishinaabe, a term that refers to a group of Native tribes found in parts of Canada and the US, and comes from what she describes as “a little village called East Lake, Minnesota.” When I spoke to her, her hunger strike was on day 33. She’s surviving on “pretty much anything that’s liquid water,” including “nourishment tea from the Seneca nation, which heard about my hunger strike and sent some tea so I can drink,” Aubid said.

Aubid is one of the many Indigenous and climate activists protesting to try to convince President Joe Biden to cancel the Line 3 pipeline project, the way he canceled the Keystone XL with an executive order back in January.

The fight over the roughly 340-mile Line 3 pipeline expansion project, which when completed will transport 1 million barrels of tar sands oil per day from Alberta, Canada, across much of northern Minnesota to Superior, Wisconsin, has been heating up since December, when Enbridge, the Canadian multinational energy transportation company responsible for the project, began construction on the new portion of the pipeline.

Enbridge says the project will create thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into Minnesota’s economy. The company also said via email that it has done everything required under the law to receive approval for the pipeline and ensure it operates safely.

But Indigenous groups and climate activists say Line 3 poses a significant risk of oil spills that could destroy precious water resources, wetlands, and ancestral lands. Line 3 will have the equivalent climate impact of bringing 50 new coal plants online, according to one report.

At this point, the Line 3 project, which is actually a rerouting of an existing pipeline, would see the original pipeline abandoned and a more than 300-mile section laid through new Minnesota land, is about 50 percent complete. Enbridge will begin what it says is a planned pause on construction for two months beginning April 1.

In the meantime, there are both state and federal lawsuits challenging Enbridge’s permits, but activists are holding out hope that Biden will cancel the pipeline altogether.

Here’s what the Line 3 project would mean for the region, why Indigenous groups and climate activists are opposed to it, and what if anything can stop it from becoming operational later this year.

Line 3, briefly explained

First built in the 1960s, the current Line 3 crude oil pipeline stretches more than 1,000 miles from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, through Minnesota, and on to Superior, Wisconsin, where it ends.

In 2014, citing corroded pipes and the demand for more oil, Enbridge began the designing and permitting process to reroute Line 3 farther south across more than 330 miles of northern Minnesota. The expansion would add a new pipeline corridor and double the amount of oil transported through the pipeline to 1 million barrels per day. The old pipeline has been operating at half capacity.

Enbridge says it has done the necessary work and received the necessary permits for the Line 3 replacement and that modifications have been made to minimize the pipeline’s environmental impact.

In an email to Vox, Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said Line 3’s replacement is “the most studied pipeline project in Minnesota history [and] has been the subject of more than six years of science-based review by regulatory and permitting bodies.”

Kellner said the process included “more than 70 public hearings, a 13,500-page Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), four separate reviews by independent administrative law judges, and 320 route modifications in response to stakeholder input and reviews and approvals.”

Enbridge claims that, over two years, Line 3 will create 4,200 jobs in Minnesota, half of which will be for local union workers, and that it will provide a $2 billion jolt to the Minnesota economy during project design and construction. But according to the Star Tribune, so far only 33 percent of workers on Line 3 are from Minnesota.

Line 3 is in fact very much like Keystone XL

Enbridge also argues that the Line 3 expansion is needed to safely deliver tar sands oil and prevent leaks, because otherwise that oil would travel by train.

“Line 3 is not like the Keystone XL pipeline. It already exists,” Enbridge’s Senior VP Mike Fernandez told CNN. But on this point, Fernandez is mistaken. The Keystone XL pipeline was also an extension of existing pipeline infrastructure, so Line 3 is in fact very much like Keystone XL.

And activists are arguing Biden should cancel Line 3, just as he canceled Keystone XL.

Concerns about oil spills, land impacts, and climate change are driving Indigenous-led opposition to Line 3

Opposition to Line 3’s new route stems from the risk of oil spills, disruption to the land, and its contribution to climate change.

Line 3 will deliver oil from Alberta’s tar sands — a thick, dense substance called bitumen — which is more expensive, more difficult, and even worse for the environment to extract than other forms of oil.

And if the oil spills, activists worry Enbridge won’t have the ability to clean it up. A 2016 report found that tar sands oil is much more difficult to clean up than non-tar sands oil.

Most of Alberta’s tar sands oil is trapped beneath the boreal forest, which means trees must be cleared for companies like Enbridge to get access to the oil. Once the forests are cleared, a lot of the tar sands oil requires in situ mining, in which hot steam is pumped underground to help liquefy the tar sands oil so it’s ready for extraction.

Once pulled from the ground, the trouble doesn’t end there: Throughout its lifetime, a gallon of gasoline made from tar sands oil emits 15 percent more carbon dioxide than one made from conventional oil, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“It’s the spills — which always happen with pipelines. It’s the disruption itself of just the pipeline going into 800 wetlands, 200 bodies of water. Then there’s the climate change piece, emissions of this 50 coal plants, absolute insanity,” attorney Tara Houska of Couchiching First Nation, founder of the advocacy organization Giniw Collective, told CNN in a March 18 interview about the Line 3 project.

Concerns about oil spills are understandable. In 1991, the original Line 3 pipeline leaked 1.7 million gallons of crude oil into the nearby Prairie River in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Luckily, it was the dead of winter and the river was covered by thick ice, which prevented the oil from entering and polluting the water used by millions of people downstream on the Mississippi River.

Activists say the 1991 spill is proof oil pipelines are too dangerous in Minnesota, but concerns about oil pipelines in the region don’t stop there.

In 2010, there was the Kalamazoo River Oil Spill in Michigan — the second-biggest inland oil spill in US history. Enbridge’s Line 6B pipeline ruptured, spilling more than 1 million gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek, which spread to the Kalamazoo River.

It took Enbridge 17 hours to notice the spill, raising concerns about whether the company could properly monitor its pipelines for leaks. Cleanup for the spill took years and ultimately cost Enbridge $1.2 billion.

Line 3 activists are concerned that the same or worse could happen along the more than 300 miles of proposed pipeline that would extend across bodies of water, wetlands, and wild rice beds in northern Minnesota.

Water is of particular concern to the Anishinaabe women who see themselves as responsible for protecting it.

“We consider water not a resource — not something to be bought or sold, but a living, thinking, sentient relative and the portal through which everything comes to life,” Simone Senogles, the Food Sovereignty Program coordinator at Indigenous Environmental Network, told me. For some, Senogles admits, “it can sound ‘New Age-y,’ but it’s not. It’s just a worldview that Anishinaabe have.”

“It’s a way that has allowed us to live in this place forever and not to have done harm the way colonizers have done,” Senogles said. “They’ve only been here 500 years and they’ve already screwed it up.”

The Line 3 extension would also cross through the Leech Lake and Fond Du Lac reservations — land where, according to the terms of an 1855 treaty, Ojibwe tribes have the right to gather, hunt, and fish. For this reason, Anishinaabe activists say the pipeline violates the terms of the treaty.

“What is spelled out in the treaty — the pipeline could pollute food sources, water sources, everything spelled out in the treaty what we as Anishinaabe people can do — hunt, fish, gather food, medicine. Line 3 goes against what we do spiritually as a people,” Aubid told me.

In her email, Enbridge’s Kellner said the company “has demonstrated ongoing respect for tribal sovereignty.” Citing negotiations with tribal leadership that led to routes that avoided reservations, Kellner said that “Both Leech Lake and Fond du Lac have spoken and written repeatedly in support of project permits.”

When asked about the tribes who agreed to Line 3’s expansion, Aubid says when faced with the decision, “the [tribal] leadership pretty much had a Sophie’s Choice type of deal: either this or that.”

Aubid also blamed some of the Native support for the pipeline on lateral violence, in which members of a marginalized group act in counterproductive ways that end up harming their community. “They try to speak for all Native communities which they do not have the right to do,” Aubid said of the members who approved Line 3.

But Aubid also stressed that when faced with the fact that there are already pipelines running through Minnesota reservations, it’s a case of “damned if they do, damned if they don’t.”

Beyond concerns about the land and water resources, a January 2020 report by 13 environmental groups found the proposed reroute of Line 3 would reverse any gains Minnesota has made in its fight against climate change.

The report estimated that the Line 3 expansion and the resultant doubling of its capacity would have the same impact on CO2 emissions as adding 50 new coal plants or 38 million additional gasoline vehicles to the road.

And each year the pipeline operates, it will release 193 million tons of harmful greenhouse gases — from oil extraction to burning — which is more than Minnesota released in all of 2016, according to the report.

Legal challenges could halt construction. So could President Biden.

Line 3 is currently facing legal challenges at both the state and federal level.

“There are very important concerns that have not been appropriately addressed by the state or the federal government — climate, issues concerning tribes and tribal citizens’ well-being, and water quality,” said Moneen Nasmith, staff attorney at Earth Justice, a nonprofit public interest environmental law organization.

Nasmith has been working on Line 3 litigation for several years and has worked closely with the Red Lake and White Earth tribes as well as Honor the Earth, a Native-led nonprofit environmental justice organization, and other local groups.

On March 23, oral arguments began in the first of two Minnesota state lawsuits. In that suit, the Minnesota Department of Commerce is joined by the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Honor the Earth, the Sierra Club, and other organizations in suing the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The lawsuit claims that oil demand does not justify the extension of Line 3 and that the oil spill analysis was improperly done.

Minnesota Public Utilities Commission executive secretary Will Seuffert said via email that the commission “extensively considered the impacts of climate change in making its decision, in particular Chapter 5 of the Environmental Impact Statement [which] addresses air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change issues.”

On the issue of tribal rights to the land, Seuffert said: “The Commission does recognize the Treaty of 1855. Several tribal nations participated in the proceedings, taking different and competing positions, and the Commission considered all of that input, and the Treaty of 1855, in making its decisions.”

Senogles, who attended the hearing, told me: “It was a pretty good hearing. The judges asked questions that gave me hope that they are understanding our argument and seeing what we’re trying to express.”

In the second state lawsuit, Friends of the Headwaters, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, the Sierra Club, and Honor the Earth argue that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which has regulatory control, didn’t consider the long-term or climate impacts of the project.

Had they been properly considered, Nasmith told me, “there’d be no way for the project to proceed.”

At the federal level, the same five plaintiffs are challenging the Army Corps of Engineers for issuing the water permit for the project without doing a proper assessment of its environmental impact.

“If we were to win any of the cases, it would stop Line 3,” Nasmith said.

“We’ve had four administrative law reviews and we’ve gone through all this work with the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Indian Affairs — it’s a little bit like the election, where we’ve gone through the entire process but people don’t want to accept that process,” Enbridge VP Fernandez said in a March 6 interview with PBS.

But those fighting against Line 3 aren’t convinced.

“There’s a lot of unjustified blind faith that this company that has a troubled track record, to say the least, will build and operate this pipeline in a way that is sufficiently protective of the waterways and wetlands that it’s crossing,” Nasmith said.

They’re not relying just on the lawsuits to stop the project, though. They’re calling on President Biden to stop the pipeline.

Legal experts told me the Biden administration could halt construction on Line 3 and make Enbridge apply for another permit that more fully considers the project’s potential impact on the environment, Indigenous rights to tribal lands, and climate change.

Back in August, when she was still president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Biden’s domestic climate czar Gina McCarthy tweeted her support for “Indigenous leaders and climate activists in urging @GovTimWalz to oppose Enbridge’s Line 3 tar sands pipeline and protect Minnesotans’ health, water, and land.”

Now that she’s in the administration, though, it’s unclear whether McCarthy still supports opposing the pipeline. It’s also unclear what recently confirmed Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland — a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the first-ever Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position — thinks about Line 3. Vox reached out to a representative from Haaland’s office for comment but did not receive a response as of time of publication.

The White House declined to comment on the record for this story. However, a spokesperson speaking on background told me that “President Biden has proposed transformative investments in infrastructure that will not only create millions of good union jobs but also help tackle the climate crisis.”

“The Biden-Harris Administration will evaluate infrastructure proposals based on our energy needs, their ability to achieve economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050, and their ability to create good-paying union jobs,” the spokesperson added.

But the pressure on the Biden administration to act to stop Line 3 is growing.

Resistance on the ground has grown with the warmer temperatures. There are now multiple protest camps along Line 3’s expanded route, with activists committed to doing everything they can to get Biden to revoke the federal permit. Some protesters have been arrested while putting their bodies in the line of construction or simply for being in the area.

For Senogles, the experience of being arrested while defending the land is one she knows firsthand. She told me she spent a night in jail back in December after attending a protest against Line 3 at the Palisades site, one of the biggest protest camps.

“There was a boy sitting in a tree who had been there for 10 or 11 days and they were coming to take him down and we were all gathered there trying to get in the way,” Senogles said. “They arrested us, flopped us around a little bit, made us sit outside with our hands behind our backs in below-zero weather.”

“While we were still standing there, they just came, got him down, and tore down the tree while we were still standing there — that’s how fast they work,” she said.

For her part, Aubid is staked out about two football fields away from the Mississippi River, where she’s watching Enbridge to make sure they don’t start drilling. When asked what would cause her to stop her hunger strike, Aubid replied: “When they shut down Line 3.”

But while Aubid is determined to continue her protest, she’s not letting it get in the way of her participation in traditions.

“Right now, we’re in our maple sugar season time. We’re boiling down maple sap into maple syrup and maple sugar. Those are the things we do as Ojibwe people,” Aubid said. “Life goes on as we are fighting this pipeline up here.”

Correction, August 17: A previous version of this story misstated the amount of crude oil leaked in the original Line 3 pipeline spill and the Kalamazoo River spill. For Line 3 it was 1.7 million gallons; for Kalamazoo it was 1 million gallons."

A new bioplastic membrane can separate water and oil before being recycled and reused, a potentially important breakthrough in cleaning up devastating oil spills.

The polymer membrane was developed by researchers at the University of Groningen and NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences, both in the Netherlands.

Made from a bio-based malic acid, it is a ‘superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membrane’. When the pores are blocked it can be depolymerised, cleaned and pressed into a new membrane.

Superamphiphilic membranes are a promising solution for oil spills but have not yet been very practical, the researchers said. The membranes are often not robust enough for use outside the laboratory environment, and the membrane pores can clog up with algae and sand.

In recent years, the researchers from both institutes joined forces to investigate vitrimer plastics, polymer materials that have the mechanical properties and chemical resistance of a thermoset plastic. Vitrimer plastics can also behave like a thermoplastic, meaning they can be depolymerised and reused. This means a vitrimer plastic has all the qualities to make a good membrane for oil spill remediation, the team said. The polymers are ground into a powder by ball milling and turned into a porous membrane through the process of sintering.

Both water and oil will spread out on the resulting superamphiphilic membrane. In an oil spill, much more water is present than oil, which means that the membrane is covered by water that can then pass through the pores.

“The water film on the membrane's surface keeps the oil out of the pores so that it is separated from the water,” said Vincent Voet from NHL Stenden.

The membrane is firm enough to filter oil from water, and can be recycled after removing pollutants and becoming clogged with other substances.

“We have tested this on a laboratory scale of a few square centimetres,” said Katja Loos from Groningen. “And we are confident that our methods are scalable, both for the polymer synthesis and for the production and recycling of the membrane.”

The team hope an industrial partner will further develop the project.

The research was published in Advanced Materials."

A student of philosophy, 1974 MSU alumnus Tim Richardson’s personal philosophy of self-fulfillment and the pursuit of internal satisfaction has shaped and guided his life and career.

But that's now how it started. Thinking that teaching was the best route for him after graduation, Richardson had secured a teaching assistantship in Ohio.

“I lived in the sticks, you could say,” Richardson said. “People were farmers, they were auto plant workers, they were teachers or any number of service industries.”

But after three years, he wasn’t enjoying academic life. This, as well as a lack of jobs, pushed him to pursue something else.

He moved to Texas in 1979 and began doing freelance work for local newspapers, and in 1983, he started his own political newsletter called the ""Quorum Report"" while his wife worked and went to school.

“It wasn’t a wealthy existence, but it was freedom and exciting,” Richardson said.

Five years later, in 1988, Richardson was hired to work on former Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen’s reelection newsletter. After Bentsen was selected as running mate to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, Richardson suddenly found himself involved in high-level politics. In 1989, he became chief of staff to Democratic Congressman Greg Laughlin. It was here that Richardson came to work on the Exxon Valdez spill.

The spill happened in 1989, when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef, tearing open the ship's hull and releasing about 11 million gallons of oil into the water. It was the worst oil spill in history. Laughlin had oversight on the spill, and Richardson went to work as a consultant for small native corporations and tribes.

“I traveled to Alaska ... and met native corporations who were on Kodiak Island,” Richardson said. “They were in the path of the spill, and I went to work for them.”

The spill had caused a considerable amount of damage to humans and the natural environment. Richardson worked with the team to repair this damage while helping communicate between the natives, the government, their lawyers and the media.

Richardson described his work as a consultant as similar to running a presidential campaign.

""I would go out and get positive name ID’s for the bear-native dilemma and Kodiak Island,” he said.

According to Richardson, he would find a variety of angles on the same issue in order to garner as much interest in an issue as possible.

He described this approach as like a wheel with spokes. The center of the wheel is the central issue — like the oil spill in Alaska — and each spoke is an audience that has a different reason to care about the issue.

Richardson's experiences working in Alaska led him to publish a book titled ""Kodiak Bears and the Exxon Valdez.""

He did similar work when the Deepwater Horizon spill occurred.

The Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in 2010, killing 11 people and leaking over 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, passing the Exxon Valdez spill as the worst in U.S. history. Richardson helped coastal counties in Texas reach a settlement.

Now, Richardson works as a multi-client consultant for similar conservation issues. Currently, he is working to repair a 140,000 acre marshland located on a beach in Jefferson County, Texas.

Richardson said that the tall grasses in the marshland can reduce the storm surge of a hurricane as it hits, making them an important asset to Jefferson County.

“This summer, we're going to be rebuilding the beach,"" he said. ""... It's probably the biggest beach nourishment project in the United States.""

Richardson regards his career path as proof that people interested in the liberal arts can still carve out a successful existence for themselves. His background in philosophy and experience writing about it enabled him to work in journalism, and it also prepared him to work in conservation, what he considers a highly ethical enterprise.

Richardson suggests that young people should look for a place that needs them.

""You might have to look at the country,"" he said. ""Where is a place that needs young people?""

Much of Richardson’s career approach is based in philosophy.

Richardson’s personal philosophy is informed, in part, by the idea that people should be able to marvel at themselves, to be pursuing something immaterial in life that gives them personal satisfaction.

“You got to have the material, got to have food, clothing, shelter, you got to have an ecology that doesn't kill you, but it's this interior life, that is where the gold is,” Richardson said."

A sponge coated with a paraffin-like material can suck up 99 per cent of oil from water at low temperatures, offering a solution to crude oil spills in Arctic environments.

Such spills happen with worrying frequency, but in the cold, oil can be more difficult to clean up. At low temperatures, crude oil’s heavier compounds, including the roughly 2.44 per cent of oil that is natural paraffin wax, begin to crystallise. The paraffin crystals then try to link together, which creates larger, stickier masses. Pre-existing clean-up technologies struggle to pick up this thicker, stickier oil.

Previous experimental removal methods weren’t that practical, as they included heating oil-laden water to break down these molecules or running the oily water through a large centrifuge to separate the molecules.

Pavani Cherukupally at Imperial College London and her colleagues have come up with a different approach. “We’re trying to keep the oil as it is, then develop the sponge to capture it,” she says. “This means we don’t have to do the pre-heating process and can directly tackle the problem.”

Read more: Sponge can soak up and release spilled oil hundreds of times

She analysed the molecular structure of the sticky oil and engineered a nanocoating with a near-identical structure. A sponge carrying this paraffin-like nanocoating is particularly likely to bind to any sticky oil it encounters. In tests, such a sponge was able to adsorb up to 99 per cent of Texas raw crude oil mixed into 100 millilitres of water within 3 hours, at temperatures as low as 5°C.

The oil was drained from the sponge by soaking it in a solvent that released the crude. The sponge’s coating withstood at least 10 further uses. “I haven’t tested it beyond 10,” admits Cherukupally. “Experiments take a long time.”

Previous research has developed similar sponges that can suck up oil, though past work hasn’t focused on the lower temperatures found in the Arctic, where a significant proportion of oil exploration and production is located.

Cherukupally hopes to improve her laboratory tests by improving the sponge and coating’s efficiency, and testing it on different crude oil grades, which have different microstructures.

This is the first model results to support the new paradigm of photooxidation that emerged from laboratory research.



After an oil spill, oil droplets on the ocean surface can be transformed by a weathering process known as photooxidation, which results in the degradation of crude oil from exposure to light and oxygen into new by-products over time. Tar, a by-product of this weathering process, can remain in coastal areas for decades after a spill. Despite the significant consequences of this weathering pathway, photooxidation was not taken into account in oil spill models or the oil budget calculations during the Deepwater Horizon spill.



The UM Rosenstiel School research team developed the first oil-spill model algorithm that tracks the dose of solar radiation oil droplets receive as they rise from the deep sea and are transported at the ocean surface. The authors found that the weathering of oil droplets by solar light occurred within hours to days, and that roughly 75 percent of the photooxidation during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred on the same areas where chemical dispersants were sprayed from aircraft. Photooxidized oil is known to reduce the effectiveness of aerial dispersants.



""Understanding the timing and location of this weathering process is highly consequential. said Claire Paris, a UM Rosenstiel School faculty and senior author of the study. ""It helps directing efforts and resources on fresh oil while avoiding stressing the environment with chemical dispersants on oil that cannot be dispersed.""



""Photooxidized compounds like tar persist longer in the environment, so modeling the likelihood of photooxidation is critically important not only for guiding first response decisions during an oil spill and restoration efforts afterwards, but it also needs to be taken into account on risk assessments before exploration activities"" added Ana Carolina Vaz, assistant scientist at UM's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies and lead author of the study.

Greenpeace Russia estimates that the country's oil companies save around $3 billion (€2.5 billion) annually by not investing in new infrastructure.","companies, water, dyachkova, russias, spills, oil, north, novikbozh, social, leaks, russia",oil spills,Man-Made Disaster,"On an August morning in 1994, Ekaterina Dyachkova took her usual walk down to the Pechora River in her village of Novikbozh in Russia's far north. As she approached, a strange smell stung her nose, and when she reached the water, she realized it was black. Boats and their oars were covered in oil.

""Our fishermen were coming back with sticky black nets,"" Dyachkova, a 62-year-old biology teacher and school director, told DW. ""It smelled like a gas station.""

The oil spill, which had occurred at nearby drilling sites in the Komi Republic town of Usinsk, went down in history as one of the biggest ever on land. Later, research revealed that multiple breaches in old Soviet pipelines had been leaking for eight months, with the fact being hidden from the public for as long as possible. When an oil slick 15 centimeters (6 inches) deep reached the river, however, the disaster was all too evident.

The 1994 oil spill in Russia's far north went down in history as one of the biggest ever on land

Ekaterina Dyachkova has been working to confront the oil giants ever since the disaster

The full scale of the accident is still unknown, with estimates on the amount of oil that spilled ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 tons. More than 120 hectares (300 acres) of fragile tundra were contaminated. Cattle developed tuberculosis, and researchers found oil inside fish, whose bone structure had also been deformed.

Without enough clean-up equipment, villagers resorted to scraping oil from the ground and skimming it out of the water with shovels. Affected areas were set on fire to burn the oil off the ground — the cheapest clean-up method, but the most damaging for ecosystems.

When oil covers birds' feathers, they can't move and suffocate as a result

""Later, we received compensation of 36 rubles. We had to laugh because all you could get for that money was two bottles of vodka,"" Dyachkova remembered.

'Welcome to the oil capital of Komi Republic'

There is a long history of oil in the northwestern Komi Republic. It was here, back in the 15th century, that Russian oil was first mentioned. In the 1960s, the town of Usinsk was a settlement for oil workers, but two decades later it had become a city built around one industry.

The oil town of Usinsk is located in the far north and belongs to Russia's Arctic territory

The roughly 40,000-strong town now greets new airport arrivals with a sign that reads ""Welcome to the oil capital of Komi Republic.""

The claim is not exaggerated. By the end of the 1990s, Usinsk oil workers had extracted some 200 million tons of oil. Nowadays, they drill an average of 9 million tons annually — more than half of Komi's total production.

Currently, Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft are the biggest local players.

Even though locals like Dyachkova have been spared another major disaster, oil spills and accidents are common.

When an oil well near Novikbozh caught fire in 2017 and flames blazed for a month, winds carried black thick smog and toxic particles across the tundra. In autumn last year, another oil spill contaminated a river where locals go fishing.

Oil at any cost

Life in Komi villages like Novikbozh is hard. Winter temperatures can drop to -45 degrees Celsius (-49 degrees Fahrenheit). And despite being located in an oil heartland, most homes like Dyachkova's small one-floor house are heated by wood-burning stoves. With no running water, locals often collect water from creeks, but they don't know whether it's completely free from oil and safe to use.

Water has to be collected from creeks, even in the coldest weather

Since 1994, Dyachkova has been part of the ""Save Pechora Committee,"" a local NGO focused on protecting the environment by documenting suspected leaks in the region.

Yet for all that, Dyachkova is not opposed to the oil industry, which employs many people from the area. She just wants companies to act responsibly.

""People should have a choice to live in normal conditions with clean air and water,"" Dyachkova said.

Fellow Novikbozh resident Galina Chuprova, who works at the village post office and is also active in the NGO, says ""laws are crafted in a way that grants oil companies a green light for everything but offers nothing in return for us.""

The village of Novikbozh has numerous oil wells nearby

Greenpeace Russia campaign director Vladimir Chuprov agrees with this description. He says the industry, which is essential to both the regional and national economies, is ""floating in conditions where companies operate outside of the legal framework.""

He says because oil companies are granted governmental subsidies and tax breaks and, most importantly, environmental laws are inadequate, they can ""get away from the financial responsibilities of oil spills and the social and environmental consequences.""

Saving money on pipelines

Oil spills are by no means restricted to this region. According to the Russian Ministry of Energy, there were over 17,000 leaks in 2019, mostly from pipelines. That data suggests an oil spill is happening somewhere in Russia almost every half hour. By comparison, the US recorded 137 spills in 2018. In Canada, where climate conditions at oil wells are similar to those in Russia, only 60 events with oil releases were documented in 2019.

*DW reached out to Rosneft and Lukoil to comment on data from Greenpeace Russia, but they didn't respond

Russia's pipeline system is one of the longest in the world and was largely developed in the Soviet era. Oil pipelines alone stretch for 53,000 kilometers (32,933 miles) — more than once around the whole Earth.

However, more than half of all oil pipelines in the country are worn from age, which is causing most of the leaks, says Russia's Natural Resources and Environment Ministry.

Oil workers from companies operating in Russia's far north confirmed in anonymous interviews with DW that the infrastructure at some oil wells is inadequate.

Regular check-ups and replacement of pipes are costly for companies and often aren't done thoroughly. Greenpeace Russia estimates that the country's oil companies save around $3 billion (€2.5 billion) annually by not investing in new infrastructure. This, according to Greenpeace, helps to keep production costs lower and makes the industry more profitable for investors.

Drilling under the watch of social media

Russia remains the second-biggest oil producer in the world. With the new vast Vostok Oil project in the Arctic, it is clear the country intends to stay on the fossil fuels path.

These days, that also means dealing with the growing public criticism on social media. Companies are confronted with evidence and forced to react.

""In recent years, we've been receiving more information from the ground, from journalists and locals. They witness spills and make them public on social media,"" said Alexey Knizhnikov, head of WWF-Russia's environmental responsibility program for business.

And this method seems to work. On May 29 last year, 20,000 tons of oil spilledinto a lake in Russia's Arctic north. Mining giant Nornickel did not inform the public for a couple of days, but pictures quickly spread on social media and made headlines in Russian and international media. Nornickel stresses to have duly notified authorities about the accident the same day it happened acting in line with the emergency response plan. However, an official press release regarding the accident was not published until two days later. Ultimately, Nornickel was forced to pay a fine to the tune of 146 billion rubles ($2 billion, €1.62 billion) — the largest ever for environmental damage in Russia.

Dyachkova's 'evening reading': boxes with documents about new local oil projects

Ekaterina Dyachkova wants to see companies made accountable like this more often. In her hallway, there are two boxes of documents relating to new oil projects across the region. The last seismic test searching for drilling points went right through her garden.

""If they build a new oil derrick right next to my village saying it's safe for us, then I would like people in charge of these projects to come and live here with their children,” said Dyachkova.

A previous version of this article referred to WWF-Russia as Russia World Wide Fund. This error has now been corrected. This article was last updated on April 1 to add Nornickel's position."

It is a superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membrane that can be used to separate water and oil. This membrane is fully recyclable. When the pores are blocked by foulants, it can be depolymerized, cleaned and subsequently pressed into a new membrane. A paper describing the creation of this membrane was published in the journal Advanced Materials on 7 March 2021.

How do you clean up an oil spill in water? This is quite a challenge. Superamphiphilic membranes, that 'love' both oil and water, are a promising solution but not yet a very practical one. These membranes are often not robust enough for use outside the laboratory environment and the membrane pores can clog up as a result of fouling by algae and sand. Chongnan Ye and Katja Loos from the University of Groningen and Vincent Voet and Rudy Folkersma from NHL Stenden used a relatively new type of polymer to create a membrane that is both strong and easy to recycle.

Dynamic network

In recent years, the researchers from both institutes have joined forces to investigate vitrimer plastics, polymer materials that have the mechanical properties and chemical resistance of a thermoset plastic. However, vitrimer plastics can also behave like a thermoplastic, since they can be depolymerized and reused. This means that a vitrimer plastic has all the qualities to make a good membrane for oil spill remediation. 'Furthermore, it was made from malic acid, a natural monomer,' adds Loos.

'The polymers in the vitrimer are crosslinked in a reversible manner,' explains Voet. 'They form a dynamic network, which enables recycling of the membrane.' The vitrimer is produced through base-catalysed ring-opening polymerization between pristine and epoxy-modified biobased malic acid. The polymers are ground into a powder by ball milling and turned into a porous membrane through the process of sintering.

Pores

Both water and oil will spread out on the resulting superamphiphilic membrane. In an oil spill, much more water is present than oil, which means that the membrane is covered by water that can then pass through the pores. Voet: 'The water film on the membrane's surface keeps the oil out of the pores so that it is separated from the water.'

The membrane is firm enough to filter oil from the water. When sand and algae clog up the pores, the membrane can be depolymerized and recreated from the building blocks after removal of the pollutants. 'We have tested this on a laboratory scale of a few square centimetres,' says Loos. 'And we are confident that our methods are scalable, both for the polymer synthesis and for the production and recycling of the membrane.' The scientists are hoping that an industrial partner will take up further development.

Applications

Creating this new membrane for oil spill remediation shows the power of cooperation between a research university and an applied university. 'A while ago, we decided that the polymer groups at the two institutes should become one, by sharing students, staff and facilities. We recently started the first hybrid research group in the Netherlands,' explains Loos. This makes it easier to find applications for newly designed materials. Voet: 'Polymer chemists strive to link molecular structures to material properties and applications. Our hybrid research team has the experience to do just that.'"

The news of such spills is announced with worrying frequency, with one of the most recent examples being the devastating Mauritius spill.

In that particular accident, the volunteers were able to collect some of the oil using their freshly cut hair; however, when a spill happens in, let's say, the Arctic, it becomes even bigger of a problem since, in cold water, oil can be much more difficult to clean up.

This happens because of crystallization. At low temperatures, crude oil's heavier compounds, including the roughly 2.44 percent of the oil that is natural paraffin wax, begin to crystallize, and the resulting paraffin crystals then link together to form a larger, more viscous mess for people to clean up. Up until now, technologies on this front, such as heating oil-stricken water to break down the molecules, have been inadequate and impractical.

Now, a team of researchers at Imperial College London have come up with a different method to tackle this dangerous problem. ""We’re trying to keep the oil as it is, then develop the sponge to capture it,"" explained Dr. Pavani Cherukupally from the Department of Chemical Engineering to New Scientist. ""This means we don’t have to do the pre-heating process and can directly tackle the problem.""

By analyzing the molecular structure of the sticky oil, Cherukupally was able to engineer a nanocoating with a near-identical structure. According to the study published in Science Advances, when a sponge is covered with this paraffin-like nanocoating, it turns into an oil-sucking machine that, in one test, was able to absorb up to 99 percent of Texas raw crude oil mixed into 100 milliliters of water within 3 hours in low temperatures such as 5°C. Then the oil was drained by soaking it in a solvent.

The coating was able to withstand at least 10 further uses, but whether it can last beyond 10 wasn't tested since experiments take a long period of time.

While similar sponges were developed in the past, this one sticks out from the rest since it focuses on lower temperatures. The majority of oil exploration and production is located in the Arctic, so this could be of great use in case of another oil spill. Now, the next step will be to improve laboratory tests by enhancing the product's efficiency."

The material may be useful for applications such as cleaning contaminated waters.



In the journal Langmuir, North Carolina State University researchers reported the findings of an experiment in which they used a material produced by the bacteria Gluconacetobacter hansenii as a filter to separate water from an oil mixture.



""It's really remarkable to think that these little bugs can make this stuff that is so perfect in many ways,"" said Lucian Lucia, the study's corresponding author and an associate professor of forest biomaterials and chemistry at NC State.



The biofilm the bacteria make and release into their environment is made of cellulose, which is the same material that gives plants a sturdy structure in their cell walls. However, when bacteria make cellulose, it has a tightly packed, crystalline structure, researchers said.



""It's one of the purest, if not the purest, forms of cellulose out there,"" Lucia said. ""It's very well structured. It's very water loving, and it's got a very high crystallinity, so it packs very beautifully. Once you strip out the bacteria, you have this amazingly tough material that has a real robustness, or toughness.""



The bacteria make the film to protect themselves, the researchers said.



""If you leave something like an unwashed dish out, it can turn all slimy and gross - that's a biofilm,"" said study co-author Wendy Krause, associate professor of textile engineering, chemistry and science at NC State. ""Different bacteria make different biofilms. The bacterial film that we're studying is made of cellulose. The bacteria are making it because they live on it and in it. They're making their home.""



In the experiment, researchers used the bacteria as factories of cellulose nano-fibers. They then removed the bacteria and their non-cellulose residue. Finally, the researchers used the cellulose membrane to see if it could separate water from a solution containing both oil and water.



They found the material was effective at removing water, and it was sturdy.



""The oil doesn't want to go through the membrane; it has a repulsive effect to it,"" Lucia said. ""It's super fat-hating.""



""If the oil and water were highly mixed, it doesn't matter,"" Krause added. ""You could put an immersion blender into the solution, and the membrane will still separate the water and oil.""



Researchers see a variety of potential applications for the material in situations where you need to recover water from an oily mixture - whether it be to clean water contaminated with a textile dye or for environmental remediation. In future work, the researchers want to explore how they can tailor the membrane by chemically modifying it for certain applications.

For Immediate Release

DENVER -- The Department of Interior announced Tuesday that it will begin its comprehensive review of the department’s oil and gas leasing and permitting activities as required by President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis. This review, which follows a pause on new leasing activity by the administration, will begin with a public forum on March 25, featuring presentations from stakeholders.

The executive order directs the department to assess the costs to the climate and environment of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices in light of the department's responsibilities as steward of public lands and oceans.

Events like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which released 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and killed up to 170,000 sea turtles and 800,000 birds, show the environmental risks of offshore drilling. The infrastructure needed to support drilling comes with a crushing cost to the environment and coastal communities, as Environment America Research & Policy Center found in its 2019 Offshore Drilling, Onshore Damage report.

Environment America’s Protect our Oceans Campaign Director Kelsey Lampe released the following statement:

“Offshore oil drilling is dirty, dangerous and doesn’t belong in our coastal waters. We are thrilled that President Biden put a pause on leasing while his administration studies drilling’s inherent threats to America’s wildlife and our climate, and we look forward to bringing an end to the practice. From oil spills at sea to air pollution on land, from oil rig to onshore pipeline, bringing fossil fuels to market isn’t worth the risk and isn’t compatible with a healthier, greener future.”

Environment America’s Public Lands Campaign Director Len Montgomery released the following statement:

“Our public lands provide the space and serenity for Americans to lose themselves in the great outdoors. Parks, monuments, wildlife refuges and forests also provide space and habitat for wildlife. Polluting oil operations are inconsistent with what public lands represent in our country’s culture or ethos. We need to make drilling for fossil fuels on public lands a relic of the past. It puts our country’s natural heritage at risk for a little more oil at a time when we are beginning the rapid transition to clean, renewable energy.”"

More than 1,000 tons of tar are estimated to have washed onto Israel’s Mediterranean coastline last month, causing extensive environmental damage and forcing the closure of beaches to the public. Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority called the incident one of the country’s worst environmental disasters, and the cleanup is expected to take months.

Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Ministry identified the Emerald as the ship it believed was responsible for the oil spill. Its investigation determined the ship was smuggling oil from Iran to Syria when the spill occurred in early February.

Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel has claimed that the oil spill was an intentional attack by Iran, but has provided no evidence for her claim.

Ministry officials investigating the incident said it was unclear whether the spill was deliberate or accidental, but said that they had received no warning about the incident until tar started washing up on the shore.

Defense officials have largely remained silent about the charge by Gamliel, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party.

But according to several news reports, the security establishment has so far found no evidence of the claim that the spill was deliberate “environmental terrorism.”"
