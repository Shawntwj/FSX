North Korea’s state media reported on January 9 that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to advance the country’s nuclear capabilities by making its nuclear missiles smaller and pursuing a more advanced type of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Kim made the comments on January 8, during the Eighth Congress of the ruling Workers’ Party.

“We must develop tactical nuclear weapons that can be applied in different means in the modern war depending on the purpose of operational missions and targets, and continue to push ahead with the production of super-large nuclear warheads,” Kim said.

Kim’s main goals for strengthening his country’s defense power are to develop nuclear-powered submarines and increase the hit rate of an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 15,000 kilometers. The miniaturization of nuclear weapons, creation of tactical nuclear weapons, and the production of super-large nuclear warheads were also included as goals.

“As Kim Jong Un directly declared that North Korea is a nuclear power and said he would upgrade its nuclear capabilities, I think it is only a matter of time before he achieves what he said,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, told The Diplomat.

Also in his remarks, Kim publicly made clear that he will not give up North Korea’s nuclear weapons unless Washington withdraws its hostile policy toward Pyongyang such as U.S.-led economic sanctions. He added that Washington’s choice of a different path to deal with the North could be the key to establishing a new U.S.-North Korea relationship.

North Korea assessed relations with the U.S. by saying that “whoever takes power in the U.S. will never change the reality of the U.S. and its policy towards North Korea,” citing its distrust that Washington sincerely desires peace on the Korean Peninsula.

As for South Korea, Kim said that inter-Korean relations are “on the verge of disaster,” adding that ties have returned to the strained state they were in before the Panmunjom Declaration of 2018. Recently, South Korea has offered cooperation on issues such as pandemic management, humanitarian aid, and individual tourism in a bid to improve ties. However, the North has made its stance clear: Inter-Korean relations can only be improved if South Korean authorities fundamentally eliminate their supposedly abnormal and anti-unification behaviors toward the North.

North Korea claims that Seoul has ignored its repeated warnings to stop bringing in high-tech military equipment and conducting joint military exercises with the United States. Pyongyang argues that South Korea’s military build-up, including the introduction of the F-35A stealth fighter, and the continuation of U.S.-ROK joint drills are contrary to the September 19, 2018 inter-Korean Military Agreement. That agreement was signed during the third inter-Korean summit in September 2018, in Pyongyang.

Part of that agreement says that “South and North Korea have decided to stop all hostile acts against each other, which are the source of military tension and conflict, on the ground, at sea and in all spaces, including the air.” Pyongyang argues Seoul has been violating that section through joints drills with the United States.

The South Korean and U.S. Air Force conducted a two-week drill starting in April 2019 to replace the earlier large-scale air exercise called “Max Thunder.” South Korea and the U.S. had scaled back the drill in consideration of the 9/19 Military Agreement, but still the move sped up the glacial turn in inter-Korea relations.

“There is no need to show goodwill unilaterally to Seoul authorities as before, and we should deal with it only as much as we respond to our legitimate demands,” Kim said at the Party Congress. However, he did not completely rule out the possibility of better ties, saying that inter-Korean relations could improve depending on the attitude of the South.

North Korea’s state media also reported on January 11 that North Korea has dealt with the revision of the Workers’ Party convention on January 10, the fifth day of the Workers’ Party Congress.

Notably, the party revived the secretariat for the first time in five years. The Seventh Party Congress in 2016 had changed the secretariat into the Executive Policy Bureau.

Also through the revision of the party convention, Kim Jong Un has been nominated as the Workers’ Party’s general secretary, an upgrade from his previous title of chairman.

Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, known as the second most powerful person in the North, became a member of the party’s Central Committee but was excluded from the list of candidates for the Politburo – officially the top echelon of political power. She has not been renamed in the position she held last year, either. But given the fact that she has been heavily involved in overall state affairs recently, experts say that her position has not been weakened, even if she was not promoted to the Politburo.

As Kim Yo Jong played the role of “bad cop ” in South Korea last year, experts predict she must have felt a lot of pressure. That may be why Kim Jong Un excluded her from an official promotion, to help shield her. However, it does not mean she has lost her power.

“The most basic condition to go to a high-ranking position is to become a member of the party’s Central Committee, and since Kim Yo Jong is already a member of the Central Committee, she is likely to be appointed to a high-ranking position at any time,” Yang said. “It is important to note that no secretary for South Korea is currently registered on the secretary list of the North’s Workers’ Party; she may take the post in the future.”

In the midst of the Congress, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a North Korea military parade on the night of January 8 at Kim Il-sung Square. As Kim vowed to strengthen nuclear weapons at the Party Congress, chances are high that in the coming years he will use military parades to unveil new weapons.

The Congress has been in session since January 5 and it is likely to be adjourned early this week after releasing the full report to the party, according to experts."

Iran has been accelerating its breaches of the nuclear deal and earlier this month started pressing ahead with plans to enrich uranium to 20% fissile strength at its underground Fordow nuclear plant. That is the level Tehran achieved before striking the deal with world powers to contain its disputed nuclear ambitions.

The Islamic Republic’s breaches of the nuclear agreement since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018 and subsequently imposed sanctions on Tehran may complicate efforts by President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, to rejoin the pact.

“The Trump administration chose what it called the maximum pressure campaign on Iran. The result was that this strategy only increased the risk and the threat,” Le Drian told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.

“This has to stop because Iran and - I say this clearly - is in the process of acquiring nuclear (weapons) capacity.”

The agreement’s main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it so chose, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.

Western diplomats have said Iran’s repeated breaches have already reduced the “breakout time” to well below a year.

Iran denies any intent to weaponise its nuclear programme.

With presidential elections in Iran due in June, Le Drian said it was urgent to “tell the Iranians that this is enough” and to bring Iran and the United States back into the accord.

Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes strict compliance with it. Iran says sanctions must be lifted before it reverses its nuclear breaches.

However, Le Drian said that even if both sides were to return to the deal, it would not be enough.

“Tough discussions will be needed over ballistic proliferation and Iran’s destabilisation of its neighbours in the region,” Le Drian said."

Iran has no credible civilian use for uranium metal and must reverse its latest move towards increased enrichment, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK - the E3 countries - said on 16 January. In response, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) said it wanted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ""avoid mentioning unnecessary details"".

Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiyee (Image: Fars news agency)

At the turn of the year, Tehran informed IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi that it planned to start 20% uranium enrichment, which is a purity level five times' that which it agreed under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). The announcement followed the passing of a new law in December by the Majles, the Iranian parliament, which requires the AEOI to produce at least 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium annually at the Fordow nuclear site. The law also stipulates that Iran will no longer be bound by the NPT Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol it had signed with the IAEA, meaning that access to its nuclear sites by international inspectors would cease.

The E3 said they were ""deeply concerned"" by Iran’s latest announcement.

""Iran has no credible civilian use for uranium metal. The production of uranium metal has potentially grave military implications,"" they said, adding that, under the JCPoA, Iran had committed to not engaging in production of uranium metal or conducting research and development on uranium metallurgy for 15 years.

""We strongly urge Iran to halt this activity, and return to compliance with its JCPoA commitments without further delay if it is serious about preserving the deal,"" they said.

According to the Tasnim news agency, the AEOI sought to clarify the E3 statement.

""The issue of the factory producing uranium metal, which is stipulated in Article 4 of 'The Strategic Action to Lift Sanctions and Protect the Iranian Nation's Rights Act' and which the AEOI is obliged to do as instructed by the Parliament, and the issue of the production of advanced fuel (silicide) to be used at the Tehran Research Reactor are two completely different issues,"" the AEOI said.

The AEOI added that it had not yet provided the IAEA with information on the Design Information Questionnaire for the uranium metal production plant, which is the subject of Article 4 of the Statute of the IAEA. ""This information will be provided after the required measures are adopted, and duly at the specified time stipulated in the relevant law,"" it said.

The plan to produce advanced fuel (silicide) was presented to the IAEA for the first time over two years ago, and during this time, complementary information as well as information on the design information questionnaire has been sent to the IAEA in several phases, it said. ""Moreover, it is reminded that in the early 1980s, the IAEA was sent a report on the successful implementation, at a preliminary level and to a small extent, of research and development work regarding the production of uranium metal for peaceful and conventional purposes,"" it said.

""It needs to be explained that uranium metal is an intermediary product in the process of producing advanced fuel (silicide), which is immediately produced afterwards during the non-stop production process. It is hoped that the IAEA will avoid mentioning unnecessary details in it reports to eliminate any grounds for misunderstanding,"" it said.

Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiyee dismissed media claims that US President-elect Joe Biden's team had been in talks with Tehran about the JCPoA.

According to the Fars news agncy, Rabiyee said today: ""Our focus now is on the full revival of the nuclear deal by all parties to the agreement and we expect the new US administration to focus on gaining Iran's trust through the full and immediate implementation of all its undertakings. The US government should first implement its undertakings under the nuclear deal and the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, and this is the only way forward for the new US administration.""

Iranian Envoy and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi said yesterday: ""There is a timetable in the [Iranian] parliament’s bill and we are moving in the same direction, so we [at the foreign ministry] are not entitled to specify the period for how long we will wait. In the first place, we make decisions based on national interests, and secondly, we should act on the basis of and within the framework of the parliamentary bill.""

Meanwhile, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the AEOI, announced that the country is at present producing nearly half a kilo of uranium enriched to the 20% purity level per day.

""Based on the latest news I have, they (the Iranian scientists at nuclear installations) are producing 20 grams (of 20% enriched uranium) every hour; meaning that practically, we are producing half a kilo every day,” Salehi said in an interview with the Persian-language Khamenei.ir website released yesterday.

""We produce and store this 20% (enriched uranium) and if they return to the nuclear deal, we will return to our undertakings too,” he added.

Asked about the recent bill approved by the parliament to adopt strategic measures to remove sanctions against Iran, Salehi said that the AEOI is required to implement it. ""It is a reality and both the government and the AEOI have declared that they do not have any technical problems with implementation of the parliament’s bill and we launched 20% enrichment within 24 hours,"" he said.

It was just the latest iteration of tit-for-tat provocations between the United States and Iran since President Trump unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed severe economic sanctions. Under the terms of the nuclear deal, Tehran is allowed to enrich uranium to only 3.67 percent—well below the threshold needed for a nuclear device—and no enrichment is allowed at the Fordo plant.

Monday’s announcement did not come as a complete surprise, because the Iranian parliament recently passed a bill that approved enriching uranium to prod Europe to ease sanctions. The move also will put pressure on President-elect Biden, who has said that he is willing to reenter the nuclear deal.

To better understand the ramifications of Iran’s intention to enrich uranium to 20 percent, I ran some questions by Edwin Lyman, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Below is a transcript of my conversation with Dr. Lyman.

EN: First, let’s start with the basics. What exactly is enriched uranium?

EL: Uranium that occurs naturally in the environment is primarily composed of two isotopes, which are variants of the same element that have different atomic weights: uranium-238 and uranium-235. Natural uranium, which contains more than 99 percent uranium-238 and less than 1 percent uranium-235, can be used in some types of nuclear reactors, but it cannot be used in the most common type, the light-water reactor. It also cannot be used as fuel for a nuclear weapon.

To obtain uranium that can be used in a light-water reactor or a nuclear weapon, it must undergo a chemical process called enrichment, which increases the relative amount of uranium-235. Light-water reactors typically use uranium that has been enriched to around 3 to 5 percent uranium-235. Nuclear weapons typically use uranium enriched to 90 percent uranium-235. However, it is possible to build a nuclear bomb with much lower levels of uranium-235, perhaps as low as around 10 percent.

Enrichment is a complex and difficult process because it has to separate two isotopes that are very close together in weight. The state-of-the-art enrichment technology today is called the gas centrifuge. Industrial-scale enrichment plants could have tens of thousands of centrifuges coupled together. A civil enrichment plant designed to produce fuel for nuclear power reactors could be easily reconfigured to produce material for nuclear weapons. That’s why such facilities pose nuclear proliferation risks and need to be rigorously safeguarded.

Countries also could use plutonium to make a nuclear bomb, but there is no indication that Iran possesses a significant amount of it.

EN: As you know, it was just reported that Iranian scientists have loaded centrifuges with more than 285 pounds of uranium to be enriched to 20 percent uranium-235. What does that mean? Is it a cause for concern?

The 20 percent uranium-235 threshold is the dividing line between “low-enriched uranium” (LEU) and “highly enriched uranium” (HEU). Twenty percent is the lowest enrichment that is considered practical for making a nuclear weapon, because the quantity of uranium needed and the difficulty of turning it into a high-yield weapon increases sharply as the enrichment drops below 20 percent. The International Atomic Energy Agency considers HEU to be “direct use” material for nuclear weapons and applies much more stringent safeguards to its production and storage than LEU. But keep in mind, 20 percent is not a magical dividing line between weapon-usable and non-weapon usable material. As I mentioned earlier, it is possible—although likely very difficult—to produce a nuclear bomb with uranium enriched as low as around 10 percent.

Twenty percent is also significant because a country possessing a stockpile of uranium enriched just below 20 percent and an enrichment facility of a fixed size would be able to produce a given quantity of 90 percent HEU nearly four times more quickly than if it only possessed 3.67 percent enriched material, which is what the Iran nuclear agreement—officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—permitted Iran to stockpile. But this difference might not be that great in practice, depending on the size of the enrichment facility and what the enrichment goal would be. It is also important to factor in a country’s level of sophistication in bomb design, as well as the number and type of weapons it would want to produce. Again, I want to stress that it isn’t necessary for Iran to enrich uranium 90 percent to make a nuclear weapon, as so many news outlets have misleadingly reported.

EN: So how close is Iran to producing enough enriched uranium for a nuclear device?

EL: Like any country with an enrichment facility of substantial size, Iran has the capability of producing enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in a relatively short period of time. One of the main goals of the Iran nuclear agreement was to extend the “breakout” time it would have taken for Iran to produce enough fissile material for an enriched uranium or plutonium nuclear weapon from a matter of weeks to at least one year once it decided to do so. To accomplish that, the agreement limited the number of deployed centrifuges, their capacities, and the enrichment and quantity of uranium feedstock that Iran could possess, as well as other limits on its ability to produce plutonium in a nuclear reactor. As Iran systematically breached each of those limitations in response to President Trump’s ill-advised withdrawal from the agreement, it has shortened the breakout time. My guess is that Iran could produce a nuclear device in well under 12 months at this point, if it ever really needed more than a year. But its current plan to enrich 285 pounds of uranium will probably not be sufficient to provide enough HEU for a weapon.

EN: How should the incoming Biden administration deal with this latest development?

EL: Fortunately, it is not too late to defuse the situation. As soon as possible, the Biden administration should rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement and make every effort to reverse the damage that Trump caused by abandoning it. The United States should honor its end of the deal and Iran should resume compliance with its obligations."

Now, as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden prepares to enter the White House, North Korea may accelerate its plans.

Last week, North Korea convened the Eighth Party Congress of its ruling party, only the second such event in the past four decades; the Seventh Party Congress took place in 2016 after a thirty-six-year gap. These party congresses represent the authoritative apex of North Korean state decisionmaking and cover everything from leadership matters and economic policymaking to military plans. At the most recent gathering, Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un outlined a set of ambitious, wide-ranging, and multifaceted nuclear modernization plans—the most extensive such plans that North Korea has presented in years. Kim discussed missiles compatible with multiple reentry vehicles, solid propellant intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), tactical nuclear weapons, military reconnaissance satellites, and new unmanned aerial systems, among others.

The report likely signals that North Korea is poised to resume weapons testing, as Pyongyang did in 2016 and 2017. At the same time, Kim is positioning himself for negotiations with the incoming Biden administration by communicating that, absent a shift in U.S. policy, his country’s qualitative nuclear force modernization will continue apace but may even sharply accelerate. While de-escalating tensions with Iran and salvaging the 2010 New START Treaty with Russia will be immediate priorities for the Biden administration, avoiding a renewed crisis on the Korean Peninsula will require swift diplomatic outreach.

Going Big By Going Small

One of Kim’s leading aims confirmed by these recently unveiled plans is to pursue tactical nuclear weapons. To date and to the best of U.S. analysts’ knowledge, North Korea has not yet pursued tactical (nonstrategic) nuclear weapons. These are generally shorter-range, lower-yield nuclear systems meant for use on the battlefield against military targets. North Korea’s development of such weapons would increase the nuclear dangers at play on the Korean Peninsula.

The comprehensive work report explicitly noted the “development of ultra-modern tactical nuclear weapons.” It identified “new type tactical rockets”—presumably, the KN23, KN24, and KN25 short-range missiles tested in 2019 and 2020—and “intermediate-range cruise missiles” as the delivery platforms for these new nuclear weapons. Kim further called for new nuclear weapons that would be “smaller and lighter for more tactical uses.”

Tactical nuclear weapons have a storied history on the Korean Peninsula. The United States based a variety of these weapons on the peninsula between 1958 and December 1991. The removal of those weapons in 1991 under former president George H.W. Bush’s Presidential Nuclear Initiatives was an important enabling condition for the January 1992 inter-Korean denuclearization accord, which (among other achievements) introduced the phrase “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” to the international diplomatic lexicon.

North Korea, however, never publicly acknowledged that South Korean soil had been denuclearized after December 1991. On occasions, North Korean state media has intimated that tactical nuclear weapons continue to be stationed in South Korea—as a disingenuous way to justify Pyongyang’s possession of nuclear weapons. In September 2017, at the height of U.S.–North Korea tensions, North Korea’s official party newspaper Rodong Sinmun falsely claimed the United States had conducted a “tactical nuclear bomb test in Nevada”—in reality, it was a drop test of an inert B61-12 gravity bomb. In the meantime, South Korean conservatives have expressed an interest in bringing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons back to South Korea to offset North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. In 2017, the conservative Liberty Korea Party reportedly touted its interest in the “redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula” in its party platform.

Yet, in practical terms, Pyongyang’s stated interest in such weapons is not particularly surprising. To date, North Korea has postured that it would use nuclear weapons first if its national sovereignty is threatened. In effect, if its conventionally superior adversaries—the United States and South Korea—ever initiated an attack, Pyongyang has indicated it would employ nuclear weapons against military targets to try to degrade and ultimately defeat any invasion attempt. With the development of longer-range systems, including ICBMs, Pyongyang could then hold at risk major population centers in the continental United States and in Northeast Asia to deter further escalation and terminate a conflict on terms favorable to the regime (while preserving Kim’s life). North Korea’s older Scud-variant missiles would likely have served as delivery systems for an initial nuclear strike. By comparison, new systems like the KN23, KN24, and KN25, if armed with tactical nuclear warheads, would prove more survivable and responsive in a crisis. Tactical nuclear weapons could make the front end of this strategy more credible, while introducing new risks.

For instance, many of these risks concern possible changes to North Korea’s nuclear command and control. So far, Kim appears to have a strong preference for assertive control over his nuclear forces, meaning that the authority to launch nuclear weapons is vested with only him and certainly not with the North Korean military. Despite this established chain of command, tactical nuclear weapons could create pressures for delegating such authority in peacetime or in a crisis. Separately, tactical nuclear warheads would likely be dispersed around North Korea, creating new proliferation and safety challenges. These warheads may, for example, be mated to their delivery systems in peacetime, unlike North Korea’s strategic nuclear warheads. If North Korea’s political regime were to collapse, these weapons would also complicate contingency planning for securing North Korea’s weapons.

Even if North Korea opts to keep tactical nuclear weapons in central storage during peacetime, in a crisis, Kim may face added pressures to delegate launch authority—pressures that may increase the chances of inadvertent or unauthorized nuclear use on or around the Korean Peninsula. (In such scenarios, Kim could conceivably have an incentive to delegate launch authority as a signal to adversaries that an attack designed to eliminate him personally would not forestall a nuclear response.)

A final risk concerns renewed nuclear testing. North Korea remains the only state to have tested nuclear weapons in the twenty-first century, having conducted six tests between October 2006 and September 2017. While the design knowledge about nuclear weapons Pyongyang has gained from these six tests may be sufficient for the serial production of lower-yield, compact warheads for tactical nuclear weapons, North Korea could alternatively seek to resume nuclear testing to pursue more efficient lower-yield weapons.

Nuclear testing aside, North Korea has shifted its attention in recent years to shorter-range systems that could make ideal delivery systems for tactical nuclear weapons. To recap, except for an October 2019 submarine-launched ballistic missile test, Kim has otherwise refrained from nuclear and long-range missile testing since November 2017. After the Hanoi summit in February 2019, his attention shifted to extensively testing a new suite of short-range missile systems. Twenty-five of these missiles were tested that year, leaving 2019 as the busiest missile-testing year in North Korean history. (These figures are based on a private database used by the author.) The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump largely ignored these tests even though they violated UN Security Council resolutions.

In December 2019, amid a diplomatic impasse, Kim explicitly renounced his April 2018 moratorium on long-range missile and nuclear testing, putting this possibility back on the table. Meanwhile, the way North Korea dismantled the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in May 2018 would allow Pyongyang to quickly rebuild it for renewed nuclear testing. The biggest factor weighing against renewed nuclear testing is arguably China. The sharp improvement in Sino–North Korean relations since the March 2018 meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Kim might quickly evaporate if Pyongyang were to resume nuclear tests.

A New Missile Testing Campaign?

Tactical nuclear weapons aren’t the only capability North Korea may seek to test. The Party Congress report was explicit that North Korean national defense scientists are “making preparations” for the test and production of multiple reentry vehicles as well as “hypersonic gliding flight warheads.” Like tactical nuclear weapons, each would represent qualitatively new developments for North Korea’s nuclear forces. Given the authoritative forum in which this assertion was made, these claims deserve to be taken seriously. Both technologies would contribute to North Korean confidence that existing U.S. and South Korean missile defenses may not be impenetrable. Multiple reentry vehicles, furthermore, would be a cost-effective way to grow Kim’s force size because, on balance, warheads should be cheaper for North Korea to produce than additional delivery systems.

The pandemic seems to have disrupted or delayed these plans, at least for now. In December 2019, just weeks before North Korea enacted a national lockdown that has yet to end, Kim had promised “shocking actual actions” as part of his report to the ruling party’s Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee. At the time, that promise likely corresponded to planned strategic weapons testing—especially as the plenum was preceded by two liquid propellant engine tests at Sohae. In that same address, Kim also promised to reveal a “new strategic weapon,” which later turned out to be a new eleven-axle, extra-large ICBM unveiled at North Korea’s October 2020 military parade.

In the 2020 of an alternate universe where North Korea had not limited its military activities because of the coronavirus pandemic, the world may have already seen this sort of testing. But now, with a new U.S. administration set to enter office and an authoritative promise to test, the odds of a new North Korean missile testing campaign resembling that of 2016 and 2017 have grown considerably. Both of Biden’s predecessors were welcomed into office with prominent North Korean testing, a pattern that may yet hold. These North Korean demonstrations early in a new U.S. president’s term allow Pyongyang to not only ensure its place on the national security agenda in Washington but also build leverage ahead of any possible diplomatic negotiations.

Implications for a U.S. Policy Review

This is the state of play that the U.S. president-elect will have to contend with. If the Biden administration maintains the status quo of economic sanctions on Pyongyang while insisting on the comprehensive, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of the totality of its nuclear forces, North Korea will likely up the ante by slowly but surely testing qualitatively new weapons systems. Through these tests, North Korea will aim to build leverage before entering negotiations with the United States. In effect, Pyongyang seeks to ask a Biden administration if it would rather negotiate with a North Korea that merely possesses thermonuclear weapons and operationally suboptimal liquid propellant–fueled ICBMs or instead sit down a few years from now to discuss Pyongyang’s multiple reentry vehicles and tactical nuclear weapons.

Kim was far more chipper recounting these nuclear modernization plans earlier in January 2021 than he was when he dourly recounted North Korea’s tremendous economic difficulties, which started in 2019 and only accelerated amid the pandemic in 2020. Under these constraints, perhaps North Korea’s near-term modernization plans are a check that cannot be cashed. The new U.S. administration could call Pyongyang’s bluff, but doing so would be risky. Previous administrations have underestimated North Korea at their peril, and Kim’s past pledges to push through successive qualitative breakthroughs—a first ICBM test in July 2017, a first thermonuclear weapon test in September 2017, and so forth—have not been bluster.

If Biden takes Kim’s agenda at face value, the case for a fundamental rethink of current U.S. policy grows stronger. Ever since Trump’s Singapore summit with Kim in June 2018, North Korea has indicated its interest in negotiations that would be more akin to arms control talks than the unilateral disarmament negotiations of the past. In practical terms, the Biden administration can emphasize a continued need for North Korea to refrain from further weapons testing. But these exhortations alone are unlikely to bear fruit without inducements for Pyongyang to exercise restraint. The administration should still carry out a comprehensive and careful policy review while consulting with Seoul, but Biden should make clear as soon as possible that Pyongyang can expect a new approach. This should include a willingness to offer limited and reversible relief from UN Security Council sanctions in exchange for meaningful restraint on weapons testing, for example.

Despite the broad and complex nuclear policy agenda facing the Biden administration beginning at noon on January 20, the urgency of taking swift action on North Korea cannot be overlooked."

A U.N. treaty outlawing nuclear weapons went into effect on Friday, having been ratified by at least 50 countries. But the ban is largely symbolic: The U.S. and the world's other nuclear powers have not signed the treaty.

""For the first time in history, nuclear weapons are going to be illegal in international law,"" Elayne Whyte, Costa Rica's former U.N. ambassador who oversaw the treaty's creation, tells NPR's Geoff Brumfiel.

The ban prohibits countries from producing, testing, acquiring, possessing or stockpiling nuclear weapons. It also outlaws the transfer of the weapons and forbids signatories from allowing any nuclear explosive device to be stationed, installed or deployed in their territory.

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted in the summer of 2017, in hopes of bringing new momentum to the push to curb the deadliest armament in the world. But even then, it was seen more as a moral statement than an enforceable ban.

The treaty is a 96-page reminder to nuclear weapons states, Whyte said, that ""they need to be moving forward"" with disarmament.

""How did the international community deal with slavery, colonialism? Once you delegitimize that conduct, it completely has an impact on the policymaking process,"" she said.

The problem with the ban, global security analysts say, is that while dozens of countries say an outright prohibition is the best way to move ahead with disarmament, others — particularly those who possess nuclear weapons — disagree. The new treaty has also been seen as potentially undercutting the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that took effect in 1970. But its backers argue that nonproliferation has stagnated, decades after the U.S. and others agreed to that treaty.

""Supporters of the ban treaty say it serves to delegitimize nuclear weapons and reinforce global norms against use,"" the Nuclear Threat Initiative's Isabelle Williams wrote in 2017. She added later, ""the new treaty is clear evidence of the worrying polarization of states — polarization driven, in part, by a perceived complacency among the nuclear-armed states and unwillingness to take serious steps to reduce the risks posed by nuclear weapons.""

The treaty currently has 86 signatories. It has been ratified in 51 of those member states. Early signatories included the Holy See, New Zealand, Thailand and Austria. In the past year, countries such as Belize, Benin and Ireland have ratified or approved the treaty.

Nations that signed the treaty cite ""the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that would result from any use of nuclear weapons,"" including by accident or miscalculation, saying those effects would transcend international borders.

Detonating a nuclear weapon, the signatories say, would ""pose grave implications for human survival, the environment, socioeconomic development, the global economy, food security and the health of current and future generations, and have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, including as a result of ionizing radiation.""

The treaty sets the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world, saying it would serve ""both national and collective security interests."" Any use of nuclear weapons, it adds, ""would be contrary to the rules of international law"" for armed conflict."

The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) has announced plans to install 1000 new IR2M centrifuge machines at the Natanz nuclear site in the next three months, AEOI spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told reporters gathered for Parliamentary Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf’s visit to the Fordow plant yesterday. According to the Fars news agency, Kamalvandi said Iran is enriching uranium using 100% indigenous technology.

At the turn of the year, Tehran informed IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi that it planned to start 20% uranium enrichment, which is a purity level five times' that which it agreed under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). The announcement followed the passing of a new law in December by the Majles, the Iranian parliament, which requires the AEOI to produce at least 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium annually at the Fordow nuclear site. The law also stipulates that Iran will no longer be bound by the NPT Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol it had signed with the IAEA, meaning that access to its nuclear sites by international inspectors would cease.

Asked about the possibility of Iran’s ceasing its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol, Kamalvandi said yesterday: ""We will abide by the law completely and the parliament and the government will make decisions on the issue."" Kamalvandi has said the AEOI has the capacity to produce 120 kg of uranium with 20% purity in eight months, which is four months faster than the one-year period required by the recently approved law.

On reports that US President Joe Biden wants a renegotiation of the contents of the JCPOA before he agrees to rejoin it, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the USA was in no position to ask for any conditions, adding that it is Tehran that has its own terms to allow the US back into the agreement.

The news agency said the foreign minister had ""reiterated time and again that Tehran would not change even a single word of the agreement, and cautioned the US that it needs to pay reparations for the damage it has inflicted on Iran through its retreat from the nuclear agreement"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday stuck to his stance that Tehran must resume complying with the Iran nuclear deal before Washington, which abandoned the pact under former President Donald Trump, would do so.

Making his first public comments on Iran as the chief U.S. diplomat, Blinken reiterated President Joe Biden’s policy “that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing.”

The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers in 2015 and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others.

Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, leading Iran to begin violating its terms.

If Iran returns to the deal, Washington would seek to build what Blinken called a “longer and stronger agreement” that would deal with other “deeply problematic” issues.

He did not name these but Biden has said they include Iran’s development of ballistic missiles and its support for proxy forces in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

“Iran is out of compliance on a number of fronts and it would take some time, should it make the decision to do so, for it to come back into compliance and time for us then to assess whether it was meeting its obligations,” Blinken told reporters.

“We are not there yet, to say the least,” he added. He declined to say which U.S. official would lead talks with Iran but said “we will bring to bear different perspectives on the issue.”"

But a return to the status quo that existed before Trump’s term looks tricky. Although Biden is committed to re-engagement with Iran, his aides have yet to indicate clearly when and how, suggesting that the ball is in Iran’s court. At his confirmation hearing last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States would wait until it was convinced that Tehran was scaling back its revived enrichment operations and returning once more to compliance with the pact.

“We are a long way from there,” Blinken said. “We would then have to evaluate whether they were actually making good if they say they are coming back into compliance with their obligations, and then we would take it from there.”

The Iranians want to see the Americans take the first major step. “The administration should begin by unconditionally removing, with full effect, all sanctions imposed, reimposed, or relabeled since Trump took office,” wrote Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a Foreign Affairs op-ed last week. “In turn, Iran would reverse all the remedial measures it has taken in the wake of Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.”

Why on earth should Iran—a country that stood firm & defeated 4 years of a brutal US economic terrorism imposed in violation of JCPOA & UNSC Resolution—show goodwill gesture first?



It was the US that broke the deal—for no reason. It must remedy its wrong; then Iran will respond. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 26, 2021

Zarif added that a “return to the table will be jeopardized” if Washington and its European partners insist on linking a portfolio of other concerns — including Iran’s ballistic missile program and ongoing support for proxy militias elsewhere in the Middle East — to the resumption of talks around the nuclear deal.

As the Trump administration fired off a final salvo of punitive actions against Tehran, the regime responded by stepping up the purity of some of its enriched uranium to five times the level permitted under the nuclear deal. In November, the Iranian parliament passed a law that would restrict U.N. inspectors’ access to key nuclear facilities in the absence of sanctions relief. It may be implemented as early next month.

“It is clear that we don’t have many months ahead of us,” Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations, told Reuters earlier this month, warning that time was running out for diplomacy to get back on course. “We have weeks.”

This standoff between Biden and Zarif’s boss, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, is made more fraught by domestic pressures within both countries. Republicans and supporters of the Trump administration’s approach appear to be waiting to make political hay of any perceived concession to Iran and have already started accusing Biden appointees of being soft on the regime. They are joined by officials from Iran’s regional adversaries — Israel and the Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — who say that Biden should build off the perceived leverage achieved by Trump.

Their failure left @POTUS Biden liabilities, not leverage — Dylan Williams (@dylanotes) January 22, 2021

Some analysts of Iranian politics argue that this leverage is not what it’s cracked up to be and that the regime has proved remarkably resilient despite the squeeze of sanctions. With Iranian presidential elections slated for this summer, a camp of hard-liners opposed to rapprochement with the United States already looks ascendant.

“The Iranian president has very difficult months ahead of him before he leaves office,” wrote Saeid Jafari for the Atlantic Council’s Iran Source blog. “Rouhani’s influential political rivals will do their best to deprive him of reviving the [nuclear deal] before the end of his government.”

But Iran watchers in Washington caution against worrying too much about internal political fissures within the Islamic Republic. “I would not hold the Iranian presidential election as a serious reason for urgency on our side,” said Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution during a webinar last week where she argued that Tehran’s strategy at present was aimed at goading Biden quickly back into the deal. “The Biden administration should resist the temptation to be drawn into crisis diplomacy with the Iranians.”

What Maloney and other experts in Washington advocate is a more measured approach that cools tensions without immediately lifting all of Trump’s sanctions. But a risky game of brinkmanship may now unfold, which will test cooperation between the new U.S. administration and its European partners.

“Tehran would be wrong to assume that [the Biden] administration would hesitate to maintain or even intensify pressure on the Islamic Republic — this time in coordination with European allies — if it were to issue excessive demands,” noted a report from the International Crisis Group.

Even if the regime is intact, Iranian society is paying a price. “The cost of US sanctions have so far been felt most by ordinary Iranians, who have been hit with high inflation,” wrote Iran scholars Ellie Geranmayeh and Esfandyar Batmanghelidj in an opinion piece for CNN. “The worsening economic situation did not lead to regime collapse or capitulation as the Trump administration had bet on, but instead contributed … to protests that were met with brutal force by the security apparatus.”

My colleague Jason Rezaian argued that Biden ought to make the “concerns and aspirations of ordinary Iranians central to his policy.” But after the difficulties of the Trump years, many Iranians are pessimistic about the way ahead.

“I do not think Biden’s presidency is going to make any important change in our lives,” said Shabnam, 41, a teacher in Tehran who spoke to my colleagues on the condition that only her first name be used for security reasons. “To be honest with you, the degree and depth of hopelessness and despair in Iran is so high that I am not optimistic about any action by any Iranian or American politician.”"

Henry Rome (@hrome2) is senior analyst for Iran, Israel, and global macro issues at Eurasia Group, the global political risk research and consulting firm.

Iran appears intent on generating a nuclear crisis early in Joe Biden's presidency. On Monday, the Iranian government said it began enriching uranium to the 20% level, which is close to the purity used in a nuclear weapon. It is preparing further steps in the coming months, according to a timeline passed by parliament. Iran aims to compel Biden to immediately and unconditionally remove the sanctions that President Trump began to impose three years ago after he pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei repeated this demand on Friday, calling on the U.S. to lift sanctions on Iran ""immediately.""

Biden should not play into Iran's pattern of nuclear threats combined with artificial deadlines. Biden and his team will have time — and economic leverage — on their side. The incoming administration should take advantage of its strong position to diligently pursue its goal of strengthening and lengthening nuclear restrictions and should resist the pressure to act hastily.

Biden will inherit significant economic leverage over Iran. However misguided and erratic Trump's approach was toward Iran, the president renewed and strengthened the U.S.'s most comprehensive sanctions regime. Trump failed to convert this leverage into diplomatic progress because he did not have a clear strategy or a realistic path to achieving it. While Trump repeatedly urged Iran to negotiate and ""Make the Big Deal,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's demands for Iran amounted to a call for regime change. Trump also hired John Bolton, an outspoken supporter of regime change, to serve as national security adviser. Tehran had little incentive to talk, let alone offer concessions, to an administration that ultimately sought its surrender or demise.

Biden will flip this logic. The president-elect has outlined concrete diplomatic objectives concerning Iran — including reaffirming the importance of the 2015 nuclear agreement. The nuclear deal, signed by Iran and six world powers, imposed limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. Biden and his team, which played key roles in securing that agreement when he was vice president, have proved they can negotiate in good faith and keep their word. By taking a more realistic approach, Biden can unlock the power of the leverage Trump accumulated.

U.S. economic might should not be underestimated. Combined with Iran's endemic corruption and the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. sanctions have cratered the Iranian economy, driven up inflation and eroded the purchasing power of average Iranians. The U.S. measures have effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and targeted key sectors, including energy and manufacturing. Oil exports, Iran's most important source of hard currency, remain largely crippled by the threat of U.S. sanctions. The government has tried to boost the non-oil sector and focus on trade in goods that are not as easy for sanctions to interrupt. But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's latest budget proposal continues to rely significantly on oil. Budgeting has a habit of focusing minds, and the message from Rouhani's plan could not have been clearer: The long-term stability of the economy depends in large part on relations with Washington.

Tehran will try to prevent Biden from taking advantage of this leverage by creating an atmosphere of imminence and crisis. Even as Tehran reacted to the siege at the U.S. Capitol this week, President Rouhani repeated his call on Biden to lift sanctions, saying, ""If you won't fulfill your commitments, we won't bow to you."" Tehran's efforts can be divided into three categories.

First, the Iranian president and his aides are urging Biden to move quickly, before Iran's June presidential elections. Rouhani, a relative moderate, is serving his final term. A more conservative leader will likely prevail in the election, potentially creating a window of opportunity to deal with Rouhani on his way out the door. But, as analyst Ariane Tabatabai and I have argued, the impending election will not fundamentally alter Tehran's strategic outlook or its openness to negotiations. Rouhani's successor will not necessarily be more hostile to diplomacy even if he is more anti-American. Washington should not expect that its policies can dictate the outcome of the Iranian election, and it should not allow the election to dictate its own policies.

Second, Tehran is trying to create a ticking clock with its nuclear program. The parliament passed legislation that sets up a series of dates when Iran is to take new nuclear steps. The most provocative next step, a significant reduction in international inspector access, is slated for late February. But these deadlines are purely artificial. Iran's nuclear policy is ultimately under the control of Khamenei, not the rambunctious, hawkish parliament or the lame-duck president. Deadlines can and will be fudged depending on the overall political environment.

Third, Tehran continues to bolster its forces and lash out in the region, a not-so-subtle reminder to Biden about its capability to cause trouble. Washington noted with increasing concern last week that Iranian-backed forces were planning to attack U.S. soldiers based in Iraq to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. (Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded with the bizarre suggestion that ""Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans"" in Iraq.)

On Monday, armed Iranian forces boarded a South Korean tanker and are apparently holding it hostage until Seoul facilitates the release of some $7 billion of Iranian assets frozen in Korean banks. The following day, Iran launched significant exercises with military drones.

But these shows of force may end up being self-defeating, as they turn more countries against Tehran. For example, increased Iranian provocations may push Gulf Arab states closer to Israel, strengthening the agreements normalizing relations between these countries and Israel that were brokered by the Trump administration last year.

Even if Iran does escalate its nuclear program or its provocative regional activity, Biden has tools to deflect the pressure. He plans to strengthen relations with key U.S. allies, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which are party to the nuclear agreement. Under Trump, European states spent as much time condemning Washington as they did Tehran. With unity between the U.S. and Europe, new Iranian provocations will only further isolate Tehran. The three European states on Wednesday issued a sharp condemnation of Iran's latest nuclear steps, a sign of future U.S.-European unity. Russia and China, the other signatories to the agreement, will also oppose Iranian efforts to significantly expand its nuclear program. Israel will remain laser-focused on Iran and probably will set clear red lines to box in Iranian activity.

How Biden decides to proceed with Iran will depend in part on his other priorities, as well as the views of U.S. allies. During the presidential campaign and transition, Biden and his aides indicated a desire to bolster the verification provisions of the nuclear deal and extend the duration of its physical restrictions. They have also expressed an intention to conduct broader, regional negotiations. All of these steps will require painstaking multilateral diplomacy. Ultimately, Biden should not feel rushed for these critical negotiations — and he should leverage his sanctions inheritance to advance these objectives."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will expel United Nations nuclear watchdog inspectors unless U.S. sanctions are lifted by a Feb. 21 deadline set by the hardline-dominated parliament, a lawmaker said on Saturday.

Parliament passed a law in November that obliges the government to halt inspections of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency and step up uranium enrichment beyond the limit set under Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal if sanctions are not eased.

Iran’s Guardian Council watchdog body approved the law on Dec. 2 and the government has said it will implement it.

“According to the law, if the Americans do not lift financial, banking and oil sanctions by Feb. 21, we will definitely expel the IAEA inspectors from the country and will definitely end the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol,” said parliamentarian Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani.

The comments, referring to texts governing the IAEA’s mission and activities, were carried by several Iranian media outlets.

In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran had an obligation to allow the inspectors access.

“Once again the Iranian regime is using its nuclear program to extort the international community and threaten regional security,” Pompeo said.

Iran said on Monday it had resumed 20% uranium enrichment at an underground nuclear facility, breaching the nuclear pact with major powers and possibly complicating efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal.

Iran began violating the accord in 2019 in response to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from it in 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. Tehran often says it can quickly reverse its breaches if Washington’s sanctions are removed."

Of all the international agreements President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin upon taking office, perhaps none is more controversial than the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Although the deal was containing Iran’s program until Trump withdrew in mid-2018—a move that led Iran to ramp up its nuclear activities—some are now arguing that returning to the deal isn’t a good idea or is too difficult given developments over the last four years.

This is unfortunate. Returning to the deal is not only viable but also presents the best chance of preventing an Iranian bomb. It is the best path toward building on the agreement and addressing some of the shortfalls that critics deride. Moreover, with a bit of planning, the Biden team could address several key concerns about the US return.

Arguments against rejoining the deal: Sorting the good from the bad. Some of the arguments and policy prescriptions offered by skeptics of returning to the deal are not realistic and should be dismissed. For example, some favor increasing pressure on Iran until that country’s leaders make more concessions on nuclear and non-nuclear activities. But no amount of pressure alone will cause Iran to abandon its ballistic missile program entirely or cease its support to terrorist groups, militias, and other malign non-state actors. Those policies are central to Iran’s concepts of national security and defense and ending them would require dramatic changes to the region and Iran’s threat perceptions, at a minimum. The past four years has demonstrated that extreme pressure and unrealistic demands only cause Iran to increase its nuclear program and regional aggression.

But other critiques of returning to the deal have some merit and deserve consideration. A well-planned attempt at a “clean return”—in which the United States and Iran follow a series of agreed steps that bring them back into compliance to the deal’s original terms—would address many of them.

These objections can be broken down into three categories—strategy, process, and politics.

Objections to strategy. Some argue that it makes little sense to rejoin the deal because restrictions on Iran have already expired or would expire in the next few years, and that giving Iran significant sanctions relief would yield important leverage that could help secure a follow-on deal.

In fact, rejoining the agreement would put the United States in a stronger position to address both of these concerns. By returning, Washington would immediately cease to be the problematic actor—global attention would shift back toward Iran. This would make it easier for the United States to work with the international community to limit the fallout from the expired conventional arms embargo and to plan for the lifting of restrictions on Iran’s missile program, slated to occur in October 2023. A Biden team would then have the remainder of its first term to make progress toward a new deal (or deals) that addresses Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear activities—long before the most important sunsets kick in. (The limits on enrichment levels and Iran’s stockpile of uranium, which are key to maintaining longer breakout timelines, don’t expire until 2031 and many of the monitoring provisions last even longer).

The United States still has ample incentives it can offer Iran in negotiations for a follow-on deal. These range from further assistance for Iran’s civil nuclear program, to relaxing the US trade embargo, to taking steps to help Iran actually reap the economic benefits of sanctions relief. (Recall that Iranian officials were quite dissatisfied that the removal of sanctions under the deal did not translate into the economic gains they expected or advertised.) And if and when talks expand to include missile and other regional issues, this will likely involve other players in the region that can put additional incentives on the table.

Concerns about process. Another set of concerns focuses on the process of returning to the agreement. Skeptics claim there simply just isn’t enough time. Biden will be inaugurated January 20, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will be out of office less than six months later, likely replaced by a more hardline successor. Potentially further complicating a swift return by both sides, Iran has hinted that it may insist on US compensation for its withdrawal from the deal; and it will expect Washington to remove sanctions first before dialing back its program.

True, the United States and Iran would have to act quickly to agree on the process by which both come back into compliance, but there are reasons to believe it might work. Both sides want to get it done. Iranian officials have been fairly consistent that they would be willing to return to compliance if the United States does the same. The new law recently passed by Iran’s parliament that requires Iran to gradually increase its nuclear activities and reduce inspections—while a risky gambit on Iran’s part—also creates an incentive for both sides to act early. This also won’t be the first rodeo for either side. Given that the Biden team has brought on several former Obama administration officials that helped reach the nuclear deal with the Rouhani administration in 2015, there is a good chance that these negotiating teams will once again be able to find a compromise on how to sequence a return to compliance—and do so in a way that assuages concerns about who returns “first.”

Relatedly, the fear that a US–Iran deal hammered out in Rouhani’s remaining days would be abandoned by a more hardline Iranian President has it backward: A mutual return in the first half of 2021 would actually put a future Iranian administration in a bind. It would force it to leave the revived agreement—and all of the economic and political risks that entails—rather than simply upping the ante to force a harder bargain, with the United States already being out. Moreover, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei—not the president—will be the one who makes the ultimate call on Iran’s commitments.

Finally, it is an open question whether Iran would actually ask for compensation if offered a US return, and therefore something Washington can and should test. Khamenei has been relatively quiet on this issue, and what he has said suggests that such compensation can be pushed off to a later date. Further, the United States may be able to dissuade Iran from making new demands by threatening to counter with its own set of issues, such as Iran’s progress on advanced centrifuge research and development—knowledge and experience that can’t easily be undone. Iran’s desire for compensation isn’t about money, it’s about political optics. As a result, there’s a good chance a face-saving compromise can be reached.

Fears of political costs. Concerns in this category include many of the above—sunsets are too close, the window for return is too short, the deal doesn’t address other Iran issues, and leverage will be lost—with the worry that trying to return quickly will alienate Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf partners. The belief among this group—which includes some Democrats—is that these problems make the political costs of return exceedingly high. It may be fine to reach a smaller interim deal to stop Iran’s nuclear expansion, but US domestic political realities dictate that returning to the 2015 agreement isn’t viable or wise. Or so the argument goes.

There are a few problems with this argument. First, a new, broader deal—or an interim “freeze for freeze” toward such a deal—would require Iran and the United States to reach a new bargain, whereas the 2015 agreement is something that all parties already know and have endorsed and implemented before. Crafting a new agreement is easier said than done, as each would want to avoid yielding too much leverage. Second, unlike the 2013 interim predecessor to the 2015 deal—known as the Joint Plan of Action—which was reachable in part because progress toward a comprehensive deal was being made, an interim deal now would likely be done out of recognition that a return or a bigger deal were unlikely in the foreseeable future. To date, Iran has rejected this type of bargain, and it is at best unclear if Tehran would be open to it in the future.

A Biden administration could also take several steps to address concerns that a clean return would let up pressure on other Iranian problematic activities or hang regional allies out to dry. This includes developing plans to manage other aspects of its Iran policy and engaging Congress, Israel, and Gulf partners. First, while the United States might need to reverse some of Trump’s sanctions against Iran’s non-nuclear activities, it does not need to reverse them all. The administration should develop a serious and specific plan to deal with Iranian missile developments and its provision of weapons to militias and other non-state actors. The Trump administration has increased US efforts to combat these threats through interdictions and other measures, and a Biden administration should continue them and find ways to improve. And it should commit to doing so in close coordination with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf states.

In addition, while it works out the details of a clean return with Iran, the United States should also seek to gain Iranian buy-in for follow-on talks—once both sides return to the deal—that build on the nuclear agreement and include other contentious issues. While it would be nice to get firm and specific Iranian commitments on issues such as extending sunsets now, Washington needs to be realistic. Any statement would likely need to be kept vague given that there would not be time or political will on either side to hash out specifics. And the United States would stand a better chance of getting Iran on board through quiet diplomacy rather than publicly framing this as a US red line. But even in-principle commitments to improve upon the deal or to discuss “regional security issues” could be an important signal that in short order talks would commence to address issues that both parties identify as a concern. This—combined with the unilateral measures outlined above—may help assuage concerns among critics, particularly in Congress, that such issues would fall by the wayside once the 2015 nuclear deal comes back online.

The option of first resort. It remains to be seen whether the United States and Iran will be able to build on the nuclear deal. Doing so will be incredibly difficult—more difficult than the original agreement. The Trump pathway of pulling out of the deal and trying to bully Iran into a bigger bargain failed to produce success. So it is worth trying the alternative of rejoining the deal as a first step.

The United States should pursue a return to the deal as an option of first resort on the merits alone. But even if it doesn’t succeed—for example, if Iran rejects the US offer of a clean return—Washington will be far better positioned to pivot to alternatives, to include a smaller deal or maintaining pressure. In that scenario, trying and failing would at least flip the script of the last four years: Iran would be the intransigent party, and the United States would be better able to work with the international community to address the challenges posed by Iran.

Zarif will play an important role in talks on whether Iran and the United States will fully re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on January 8 that Tehran was in no rush for the United States to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but, he also said, sanctions on Iran must be lifted immediately. “If the sanctions are lifted, the return of the Americans makes sense,” he insisted. President-elect Joe Biden has announced his plan to return to the deal soon after he is sworn into office. “If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal,” he wrote in an op-ed for CNN, “the United States would rejoin.” His Iranian counterpart, President Hassan Rouhani, has also expressed willingness to return to the deal, stating that, “Iran could come into compliance with the agreement within an hour of the United States doing so.”

Five years ago, after years of intensive negotiations, six world powers managed to sign the world’s most comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran. While the agreement was a political one, it was also ratified by the UN Security Council in Resolution 2231. And, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the organization tasked with verifying the agreement’s technical aspects, Iran was fully complying with the deal for about three years, until President Trump withdrew from it in May 2018. In response to the US violations of the nuclear agreement, Iran too reduced some of its commitments. Most recently, on January 4, Iran announced that it had increased its uranium enrichment levels to 20 percent.

Although reviving the agreement is certainly still possible, it won’t be easy. The two sides will need to overcome nine hurdles to make it happen.

First, the sequencing of a mutual return could be an immediate problem. Iran expects the United States to lift sanctions first, because it was the Trump administration that withdrew first. While Tehran’s demand is legitimate, Washington may ask that Iran come into full compliance before lifting sanctions. Indeed, a straightforward reading of the quotation from Joe Biden’s op-ed suggests just that. In this scenario, after Joe Biden’s executive order rejoining the deal, Iran and the world powers can meet and agree on a realistic plan with a specified timeline of proportionate reciprocal actions.

Second is the issue of what compliance constitutes. During the Obama administration there was one major barrier to the full realization of the terms of the agreement: Many US primary sanctions, targeting US citizens and permanent residents, organizations, and individuals that engage in trade and business with their Iranian counterparts, remained intact. These sanctions limited the economic benefits of the deal for Iran. The 29th paragraph of the deal clearly states that all signatories will refrain from any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran. This cannot be achieved without abolishing the primary sanctions.

Third, the Trump administration imposed numerous sanctions against Iran under the guise of terrorism and human rights, aimed at preventing the Biden administration from returning to the deal. For a clean implementation of the agreement, Biden will need to remove all of these sanctions as well.

Fourth, Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement and violation of the UN Security Council Resolution 2231 as well as other international commitments has damaged US credibility abroad. There is now a widespread belief among policy makers in Iran that the United States will simply not live up to its end of the bargain, no matter what that bargain is. This naturally raises the important question: What guarantees are there that the United States will remain committed to the deal in the post-Biden era?

Fifth, because of Trump’s maximum pressure policy, the Iranian economy has suffered hundreds of billions of dollars of losses while Iran was in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the deal. Some Iranian leaders, including Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have demanded compensation for the economic damage the country suffered after the United States withdrew. The challenge will be to find a mechanism to compensate for the economic damages that the Trump administration inflicted on the Iranian economy.

Sixth, the “snapback” mechanism built into the agreement allows any country to force the UN Security Council to reimpose multilateral sanctions against Iran if Iran fails to fulfill its commitments. But this is one-sided: There is no such remedy for Iran if other parties fail to do their part. This became abundantly clear when the Trump administration first withdrew from the deal and then tried to unilaterally re-impose multilateral sanctions on Iran through the snapback mechanism. It was as if the injurer was demanding punishment for the injured. Although the UN Security Council rejected the US demand, the stunt revealed the structural flaw of the snapback.

Seventh, in the first week of December 2020, the Iranian parliament passed a bill mandating Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization to resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity. The legislation also requires the Iranian government to cease voluntary implementation of the IAEA’s Additional Protocol within two months of the bill’s enactment if the other signatories fail to fully deliver on their commitments under the agreement. And after three months, the Atomic Energy Organization is obliged to begin using at least 1,000 second generation centrifuges. In short, president-elect Biden will need to move fast.

Eighth, there are some in the United States who are worried that Trump may start a reckless last-ditch war with Iran before leaving office. While this concern is overblown, there should be no doubt that US partners in the region will do whatever they can to prevent Biden’s return to the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already said as much. To be sure, the hardliners in Iran are also fundamentally opposed to the deal.

Ninth, some pundits and politicians in Washington want Biden to leverage the Trump administration’s sanctions to pressure Iran to accept additional commitments beyond the original agreement as a condition for US return to compliance. These include limiting Iran’s missile capability, extending the so-called “sunset” clauses within the deal, or resolving regional disputes. But from Iran’s perspective, such demands are a non-starter. As the spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry said recently, “No negotiation has been, is being, or will be held about Iran’s defense power.”

Despite these hurdles, Biden should nevertheless seek a reentry into the deal. Only a clean and full implementation by all parties can save the world’s most comprehensive nuclear agreement, contain rising US-Iran tensions, and open the path toward more confidence building measures. That path should include, upon Biden’s issuing an executive order to rejoin the JCPOA, the creation of a working committee of parties to the agreement tasked with ensuring full compliance by all signatories, and a forum, organized by the UN secretary general, in which Iran and the Gulf countries can discuss a new structure for improving security and cooperation in the region."

The find and Iran’s response risk hurting efforts by the new U.S. administration to restore Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, which President Joe Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump abandoned.

Although the sites where the material was found are believed to have been inactive for nearly two decades, opponents of the nuclear deal, such as Israel, say evidence of undeclared nuclear activities shows that Iran has not been acting in good faith.

Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, declined to comment, as did the IAEA itself.

A senior Iranian official said: “We have nothing to hide. That is why we allowed the inspectors to visit those sites.”

Iran has set a deadline of next week for Biden to lift sanctions reimposed by Trump, or it will halt snap IAEA inspections under the deal, which lifted sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Next week is also when the IAEA is expected to issue a quarterly report on Iran’s nuclear activities.

Seven diplomats told Reuters the agency will use that opportunity to rebuke Iran for failing to explain to its satisfaction how the uranium particles wound up at two undeclared sites. The rebuke could come either in the quarterly report or in an additional report released the same day.

OBLIGATION

U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003, which Iran denies. The 2015 nuclear deal effectively drew a line under that past, but Iran is still required to explain evidence of undeclared past activities or material to the IAEA.

The material was found during snap IAEA inspections that were carried out at the two sites in August and September of last year, after Iran barred access for seven months.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that radioactive material was found in the samples taken by inspectors at the two sites, although the newspaper did not specify what the material was.

Four diplomats who follow the agency’s work closely told Reuters the material found in those samples was uranium.

Identifying the material as uranium creates a burden on Iran to explain it, as enriched uranium can be used in the core of a nuclear weapon. Iran is obliged to account for all uranium so the IAEA can verify it is not diverting any to a weapons programme.

Two of the sources said the uranium found last year was not enriched. But nevertheless, its presence suggests undisclosed nuclear material or activities at the sites, which Iran would have had to declare.

The IAEA’s full findings are a closely guarded secret within the agency and only a small number of countries have been informed of the specifics.

Five diplomats said that after the IAEA confronted Iran with the findings it gave unsatisfactory answers. Two of them said Iran told the agency the traces were the result of contamination by radioactive equipment moved there from another site, but the IAEA checked and the particles at the sites did not match.

One diplomat briefed on the exchanges but not the detailed findings said Iran had given “implausible answers”, describing Iran’s response as “typical delaying tactics”.

The agency has said it suspects one of the sites hosted uranium conversion work, a step in processing the material before enrichment, and the other was used for explosive testing.

The seven diplomats said they expect the agency to call Iran out for having failed to explain the traces found at the two sites, as well as over its continued failure to explain material found previously at another site in Tehran, Turqazabad.

Diplomats said it remained unclear whether the IAEA’s 35-nation Board of Governors, which meets the week after the quarterly report, would take action condemning Iran. Several said the focus was on efforts to salvage the 2015 deal by bringing Washington back into it.

The 2015 agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, known as the P5+1. It requires Iran to undertake eight- to 15-year-long curbs in nuclear activities with potential for weaponization in exchange for international sanctions relief. Former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 saying it was not tough enough on Iran, which has retaliated by exceeding the deal’s nuclear limits since 2019.

“We’re prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5+1 on Iran’s nuclear program,” Biden said Friday at the White House, in a speech to a virtual version of the Munich Security Conference, an annual forum on international security policy.

Biden, who has pledged to return to the JCPOA if Iran first resumes full compliance, responded positively to an EU proposal made Thursday for the six world powers and Iran to attend an informal meeting to discuss how to revive the agreement. A State Department spokesman said the U.S. would accept such an invitation, which has yet to be publicly offered.

The Biden administration also made two gestures toward Iran, withdrawing a Trump administration request for the U.N. Security Council to trigger a “snapback” of Iran sanctions, a request that other council members rejected, and easing some travel restrictions on Iranian diplomats working at the U.N. in New York.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Twitter by reiterating a demand for the U.S. to “unconditionally & effectively lift all [U.S.] sanctions imposed, re-imposed or re-labeled by Trump” since 2018 as part of what Trump called a “maximum pressure” campaign for Iran to end objectionable behaviors including alleged nuclear weapons development that Tehran denies. Zarif said Tehran “will immediately reverse” all of its JCPOA violations if the U.S. complies.

In one of several VOA Persian TV interviews on Friday, JCPOA supporter Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, said it will not be possible for Biden to lift U.S. sanctions in the short term because of resistance to such a move from minority Republicans in Congress. He also said the U.S. gestures are unlikely to persuade Iran to abandon a threat to stop unannounced inspections by the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency at Iranian nuclear sites starting Tuesday, a move that would further escalate Iran’s recent series of JCPOA violations.

“At the same time, [for Biden] to express a willingness to have a dialogue with Iran is an important step forward for both sides to find a common ground for reviving the JCPOA and to show that the ‘maximum pressure’ era is over,” Vaez said.

Behrooz Bayat, a Vienna-based Iranian former IAEA consultant and JCPOA supporter, said the U.S., other world powers and Iran have no alternative but to save the JCPOA in the long run.

“Pursuit of other policies such as the U.S. maintaining crippling ’maximum pressure’ Iran sanctions, or Iran advancing its nuclear program will not solve anything and could end in war,” Bayat said.

Biden has said his proposed conditional return to the JCPOA upon Iran’s resumption of full compliance would be a first step toward strengthening and broadening the deal to address what the U.S. sees as Iran’s destabilizing activities in the Middle East, including its support for Islamist militias that have fought the U.S. and its regional allies.

Brookings Institution research director Michael O’Hanlon, a JCPOA critic, said Biden should use the financial leverage that Trump built with tightened U.S. sanctions to try to get a new deal that indefinitely restricts Iran’s uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities that it could weaponize.

“Iran is not going to like that idea. But there is a chance that at least some Republicans in the United States would [like that], creating a stronger foundation for this to be a durable deal and more importantly, shoring up the nuclear nonproliferation system in the Middle East,” O’Hanlon said.

Another JCPOA opponent, Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Biden should pressure Iran to make the first move toward reviving diplomacy by changing its behavior at home as well as that of its proxy militias that have staged attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and on U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia in recent years.

“Washington should be working with its regional partners as diverse as Israel to Saudi Arabia to see what they favor as an acceptable end-state [to their conflicts with Iran and its proxies], so that the inputs of those U.S. allies are included in a bigger, broader and better deal with Iran,” Taleblu said.

Iranian leaders recognise that, although the new president in the White House says he wants to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal, there has been little tangible shift away from the Trump-era maximum pressure campaign against Iran. While there is still a possibility that the agreement will be revived, it increasingly appears to Tehran that the process will be a marathon and not a sprint.

It is often difficult to find a consensus between Iranian leaders on the benefits of diplomacy with the West, but there is one point on which they agree: Tehran must end its “strategic patience” in the implementation of the nuclear deal. The rhetoric for public consumption varies between different camps in Iran, who differ on the extent and method of the response. However, political elites now generally agree that Iran should not allow itself to be ‘duped’ by the United States again – and that Tehran should not reverse any steps to accelerate its nuclear programme until Washington is certain to ease sanctions in return.

The mood in Tehran

Since the November 2020 US presidential election, Tehran has left the door open for the US to return to its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). And it has offered several pathways for achieving this. Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, suggested that the European Union, as the coordinator of the Joint Commission established under the agreement, could choreograph a return to compliance – indicating a shift away from Tehran’s original position that Washington should lift all sanctions first before Iran reversed any elements of its nuclear programme. For now, the response on the US side seems less flexible – with Biden administration officials continuing to insist that Iran must return to full compliance with the deal before it receives any economic relief.

Last week, the Iranian authorities announced that, as of 23 February, they would implement a law requiring the government to further reduce compliance with the JCPOA. This would involve, most importantly, the suspension of voluntary implementation of some international inspections. It was only after this announcement that the US made a series of symbolic gestures to soften its attitude towards Tehran. For instance, President Joe Biden stated that the US is “prepared to reengage in negotiations” with parties to the JCPOA. The hardline-leaning Kayhan Daily and a government-affiliated newspaper credited Iran’s ultimatum with prompting these last-minute US moves.

Rather than worrying about their domestic rivals, power players in Iran are currently more concerned about how splits within Biden’s team are slowing down decision-making on the JCPOA in the US. Even the Rouhani administration has become more cautious than it once was about Biden’s willingness to return to the original nuclear agreement, fearing that his recent offer of talks is designed to force Iran to accept a broader set of terms. It is true that Iran’s latest decision to reduce inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was engineered by a parliament controlled by the so-called “Principlists” – a group comprising roughly equal numbers of hardliners and radical hardliners. But, even if the parliament did not have such a composition, the Rouhani administration would have felt that it had no choice but to send a strong signal against the United States’ indecision over how and when to return to the JCPOA.

Iran has been waiting for moves from the Biden administration that indicate it is serious about rejoining the JCPOA

So far, Iran has been waiting for moves from the Biden administration that indicate it is serious about rejoining the JCPOA. The measures the US has taken in recent days – such as easing travel restrictions on Iranians diplomats in New York and rescinding the Trump administration’s failed attempt to snap back UN sanctions – are largely viewed in Tehran as symbolic rather than substantive. In recent days, Iran has reportedly made progress in its talks with Asian countries over gaining access to its frozen offshore accounts. If these discussions do indeed move forward, it could suggest that the Biden administration is showing some flexibility, by providing Iran with access to these funds for humanitarian trade. Iran may regard such moves by Biden as a reasonable way to start a technical dialogue on how to implement the nuclear deal – one facilitated by the EU.

Diplomacy and domestic politics

Even as Iran sets deadlines for its JCPOA compliance, the clock is ticking in its domestic politics – with a presidential election scheduled for June.

The Principlists hope for an easy win in the contest, counting on the kind of relatively low voter turnout seen in the 2020 parliamentary election. Disillusioned with the futility of choosing the best bad option, the average Iranians needs a strong incentive to turn up at the polling station. But the hardliners’ optimism may be premature. In 2013 they were as confident that they would win as they are now. Yet, less than two months before that election, the tide turned.

Iranians often do not decide who to vote for until the last few weeks before an election. In an undisclosed national poll conducted by ISPA in December 2020, more than 38 per cent of respondents said that they might consider voting “if economic conditions improve”. As such, there is some concern among hardliners that a swift US return to the JCPOA, and sanctions relief, would improve the chances of Rouhani-affiliated candidates. This is why some commentators speculate that Principlists feel it is necessary to obstruct Rouhani’s efforts to persuade the US to ease sanctions before the election.

In theory, this is a sound Machiavellian move. However, it does not necessarily correspond with Iran’s current political dynamics. Most Iranian elites of all political leanings want to reduce the pressure on the economy, and recognise that US sanctions have a role to play in this. In their opinion, it is better for it to happen today than tomorrow, as highlighted in a recent string of interviews published on the supreme leader’s website.

Media outlets affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are not cheering for Zarif and his team, but they are not lambasting him either. The editor-in-chief of Javan, the flagship IRGC daily, has even called Rouhani’s recent technical arrangement with IAEA a “smart” move. And the Kayhan Daily has also cautiously supported the arrangement. At present, only a radical minority in the Iranian political system are against the revival of the JCPOA. Saeed Jalili, the former chief Iranian nuclear negotiator (and a possible contender in the upcoming election), represents this minority.

Yet, more broadly, Rouhani’s rivals prefer not to bet too heavily against the JCPOA. For one thing, they do not want the blame for Iran’s economic troubles to shift onto them. For another, they believe that public disapproval of Rouhani and his allies is so intense that even the revival of the JCPOA will not reverse it – and, as such, there may be little point in campaigning against the agreement. Finally, they have other tools at their disposal to weaken the pro-Rouhani coalition – which is extremely fragile – before the election. One such tool is parliamentary manipulation of the government’s proposed budget bill for next year – which, if implemented, would increase the dollar exchange rate and, accordingly, the price of staple goods in the months leading up to the election. This could make voters resent the Rouhani camp even more.

Iran’s electoral cycle could have an influence on the political space in Tehran for engaging with the US and Europe, but it is unlikely to be the most significant factor in whether diplomacy on the JCPOA succeeds. There is now a general consensus in Iran that the country should stabilise the nuclear deal with the Biden administration, thereby rebooting the economy through benefits granted under the deal. A more pressing issue for Iran’s leaders is whether the US will rejoin the agreement without seeking to change its terms.

It is highly unlikely that the US and Europe will be able to strike a broader agreement with Iran unless they first rejoin the original JCPOA – under either the current or next government in Tehran. The longer the US takes to rejoin the JCPOA, the greater the support in Tehran for accelerating the Iranian nuclear programme. In the coming weeks, European and US efforts should focus on a swift return to the JCPOA rather than holding out for the unlikely prospect of a new nuclear formula with Iran.

Iran threatens further uranium enrichment

Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the Islamic republic might enrich uranium up to 60% purity if needed.

""Iran's uranium enrichment level will not be limited to 20%. We will increase it to whatever level the country needs ... We may increase it to 60%,"" the state television quoted Khamenei as saying.

The boost would mean that Iran would surpass the 3.67% limit that it had accepted under the 2015 nuclear deal but it would still be below the 90% mark required to make an atomic bomb.

Khamenei added that Iran will not yield to pressure on its nuclear activity.

US State Department spokesman Ned Price called Khamenei's comments “a threat"" and declined to respond to what he deemed ""hypotheticals"" and ""posturing.""

Efforts to revive deal

Former President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, while pursuing a policy of ""maximum pressure."" After taking office in January, Biden has sought to resume diplomacy and rescue the 2015 deal.

In recent years, however, Iran has slowly walked away from many of the agreement's limitations. Crucially, it has begun enriching its uranium up to 20%, creeping very close to weapons-grade levels.

Tehran wants Washington to take the first step by scrapping the sanctions that Trump reimposed on it in 2018.

Iran curbs inspectors' access

Following emergency meetings over the weekend, both the UN and Iran agreed to a ""technical understanding"" to continue ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three more months.

At the same time, however, Tehran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency on Tuesday. This includes offering ""less access'' to UN weapons inspectors.

The nation will temporarily suspend so-called voluntary transparency measures — notably inspections of nonnuclear sites, including military sites suspected of nuclear-related activity.

Tehran will also deny the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) real-time access to footage from surveillance cameras installed at some sites. If sanctions are not lifted within three months, officials will delete it, Iran's Atomic Energy Organization has said.

With the new agreement, Director General Rafael Grossi said the IAEA would be able to ""retain the necessary degree of monitoring and verification work.""

The last-minute deal had prevented the IAEA from ""flying blind,"" he said, adding that now ""political discussions at other levels can take place.""

Zarif warns of new troubles unless sanctions are lifted

Moscow welcomed the temporary agreement on Monday, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying the Kremlin hoped it would help ""the overall political situation.""

Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday also hailed the outcome as a ""very significant diplomatic achievement.""

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had warned Sunday that if the economic sanctions were not lifted, his nation would continue scaling back its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal.

The stockpile of ""enriched uranium will increase,"" he said, stressing that Tehran had the right within the agreement to stop observing commitments ""totally or partially"" if the other parties fail to honor theirs.

""We are still in the partial phase,"" Zarif said. ""We can be total.""

No one expects it to take as long to establish whether they can resuscitate the pact abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, but U.S. and European officials say the journey will be lengthy and arduous, if, indeed, they even begin the trek.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration said on Thursday that it was ready send to its special envoy, Rob Malley, to meet Iranian officials and seek a path back to the deal, agreed by Tehran and six major powers and named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

While Tehran sent mixed signals at first, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif took a hard line on Sunday, saying: “The U.S. will not be able to rejoin the nuclear pact before it lifts sanctions.”

The crux of the deal was that Iran would limit its uranium enrichment program to make it harder to amass the fissile material for a nuclear weapon - an ambition it has long denied - in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions.

In theory, it should not be hard to decide how to revive an agreement whose terms are detailed in 110 pages of text and annexes.

In reality, it will be a challenge for two reasons: the scores of sanctions that Trump imposed on Iran after walking away from the deal in May 2018 and the steps Iran took, after waiting more than a year, to violate the pact in retaliation.

While both sides have so far focused in public on the question of who moves first to revive the deal - each insists that the other must do so - a U.S. official told Reuters the “sequencing” could be finessed.

“The issue of who goes first ... I don’t think it’s the one that’s going to be the most difficult,” he said.

“It’s defining how each side views compliance,” the official added, citing instead which U.S. sanctions might be lifted and “the question of ... the steps that Iran has taken, are they all reversible?”

POLITICS, PRISONERS AND PROXY FORCES

The JCPOA, hammered out by Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, required the United States to remove only “nuclear-related” sanctions on Iran.

After abrogating the agreement, Trump imposed scores of new sanctions on other grounds, including Iran’s alleged support for terrorism.

Experts say Biden would find it politically fraught, and maybe impossible, to meet Tehran’s demands that these be lifted given the likely criticism from Republicans, and perhaps some of his fellow Democrats.

“This is an issue that is very politically sensitive in the U.S. because a number of these ... were very intentionally done under terrorism authorities,” said Henry Rome of Eurasia Group.

“The two negotiating teams will need to go through quite an extensive process of deciding what stays and what goes.”

Another challenge is Iran’s support for regional proxies, including those suspected of attacks on U.S. forces. In the deadliest such incident for almost a year, a rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq on Monday killed a civilian contractor and injured a U.S. soldier, making it harder for Washington to appear to offer concessions to Iran.

A further complication is the American desire to free U.S. citizens detained in Iran, an issue on which Washington has begun talks with Iranian officials, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday.

And while some of the steps Tehran has taken to violate the JCPOA may be reversible -- such as its enriching uranium above 3.67% and boosting its stock of low enriched uranium -- others may not. These include expertise gleaned from research and development on advanced centrifuges that would help Iran enrich uranium to the 90% weapons grade level should it seek to.

“How do you reverse the knowledge that they have gained?” asked Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution think tank.

The authorities in Tehran also face a delicate choice on how to respond to any overture from the Biden administration as Iran prepares for a presidential election in June, when the turnout is likely to be seen as a referendum on the clerical establishment amid growing discontent at over economic hardship.

Iran’s fragile economy, weakened by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic, has left the ruling elite with few options other than to negotiate, but the decision ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

It remains unclear, however, whether the two sides can even return to the negotiating table.

Iran has threatened to scale back its compliance with the deal further starting on Tuesday, notably by halting some snap inspections by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog.

Experts said that would not necessarily doom the chances for negotiations, but it adds to the challenges.

“Despite everything we remain in a precarious situation, which will become all the more so in the coming days,” said a French diplomatic source. “It’s important to revive diplomacy quickly.”"

While Biden has committed to returning to the nuclear deal – reflecting a shared US and European strategic priority to address the proliferation risk from Iran – it is unclear how he will do so. Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron pitched himself as an ‘honest broker’ between the Biden administration and Tehran – but he also insisted that countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, should be involved in talks. If Europeans want to contain the risks from Iran’s expanding nuclear activities quickly, it is critical that they avoid obstructing the process by pressuring Biden to tie the nuclear talks to negotiations on regional security: this approach would almost certainly doom the nuclear discussions – and broader Western ambitions on regional issues – to failure.

In recent weeks, there have been growing calls from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia to be included in the Iran talks. Israel is focused on pushing for a more restrictive nuclear deal that mirrors Donald Trump’s maximalist demands (including an end to Iran’s uranium enrichment programme). Gulf Arab monarchies, meanwhile, are urging the US to prioritise regional threats from Iran, including its missile programme. These countries largely share the view that the US should maintain Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to force more concessions from Tehran.

For their part, the European countries that are party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the E3) – are sending mixed signals on their priorities. While maintaining that they want the US and Iran to return to full JCPOA compliance, they are also at times pushing for further concessions from Iran as part of the process. The German foreign minister has called for a “broader deal”, while Macron (ahead of an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia) said that parties to the JCPOA “need to include our allies in the region for a nuclear deal” – although it was not clear whether he was referring to a formal process.

If European governments want to salvage the nuclear deal before it is too late, while also opening up the prospect of negotiations with Iran on regional security, they need to quickly and clearly reject the argument that the two issues should be bundled together. While there is an obvious need for regional security talks, tying this to the JCPOA process is likely to kill any prospect of successful negotiations on either track. Indeed, this is the outcome likely favoured by some states that now advocate for a more inclusive process – which hope to force Iran to capitulate on a range of issues, an unfeasible outcome so disastrously pursued by the Trump administration.

There are several factors that Biden and the E3 should carefully consider. Firstly, the reality is that, since Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal and imposed unprecedented sanctions on Iran, Tehran has made clear that it will not engage in further negotiations until America fulfils its JCPOA commitments. Following the maximum pressure campaign – which brought the US and Iran close to a military conflict – both sides urgently need to re-establish a degree of trust by restoring the previous agreement before moving on to non-nuclear issues. And while some claim that the US and Europe can use maximum pressure to force Iran to the table, the escalation that has occurred in the past four years should disabuse anyone of this belief.

It also remains highly improbable that Iran and its opponents in the Middle East could reach an agreement on these issues in the short term. Israel and Saudi Arabia are unlikely to be willing to negotiate with Iran on only the nuclear issue, leaving aside the regional concerns that Riyadh has said it views as more important. Iran is not going to be willing to make further nuclear concessions while sitting across the table from Israel – whose undeclared nuclear weapons are not monitored by international inspectors. Conditioning the US return to the JCPOA on regional security talks – which is likely to take years, if not decades, to produce solutions – is a recipe for failure.

Meanwhile, this process also risks undermining the fragile international consensus on Iran’s nuclear programme (legally enshrined at the UN Security Council). A major part of the JCPOA’s success story was its ability to bring world powers together on a common position to contain Iran’s nuclear activities. This consensus could easily fracture when it comes to Iran’s missiles and regional activities. Russia and China do not view these issues in the same way that the E3 and the US do, and they are likely to oppose attempts to broaden the JCPOA’s terms and participants. Moreover, Russia is cooperating with Iran in places such as Syria – which remains an arena for regional contestation. And, while the West and its regional partners want to limit Iran’s military capabilities, Beijing and Moscow have increased their security and military partnerships with Tehran.

The longer it takes to get the US and Iran back to the JCPOA, the more advanced Iran’s nuclear programme will likely become

Against this complicated backdrop, the US and E3 countries should remain acutely aware of a dangerous ticking clock: Iran is speeding ahead with its nuclear programme in direct response to the intense sanctions the US has imposed on it since 2019 (even as its regional activities have intensified during this period). The longer it takes to get the US and Iran back to the JCPOA, the more advanced Iran’s nuclear programme will likely become. If a harder-line Iranian government comes to power following elections this year, it will likely make progress on the JCPOA track even tougher. This could push Israel towards military action aimed at slowing down Iran’s nuclear capabilities, creating greater instability in the Middle East.

The stark reality is that, at this stage, any movement away from narrow nuclear talks designed to revive the JCPOA is likely to fail not just on that front, but also in efforts to stabilise the region.

To avoid this outcome, the US and Europe should immediately focus on addressing the nuclear issue – to both contain the Iranian nuclear programme before it is too late and to lay the groundwork for subsequent wider negotiations on regional security. This means returning to the JCPOA as it was initially agreed, without drawing in new participants or changing its terms. To be sure, Western countries should consult Middle Eastern allies on the JCPOA track. But it would be hugely counterproductive to formally draw them into the process and to hold the JCPOA hostage to attempts to force concessions from Iran on regional security or its missiles programme.

After four years of instability and a constant risk of regional conflict under the Trump administration, it is now time for a unified transatlantic approach that is realistic about what is possible with Iran. Rather than complicating a US return to the nuclear deal in a fashion that risks closing the door to all negotiations, Europeans should declare clear support for a focused approach on preserving this critical agreement.

The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake — which it initially said had a magnitude of 7.1 — struck at 11:08 p.m. local time (9:08 a.m. ET) at a depth of 34 miles. Fourteen aftershocks were recorded, it said, adding that a tsunami warning had not been issued.

The quake was also felt in Japan's capital, Tokyo.

""There have been no anomalies reported from any of the nuclear facilities,"" Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told a press conference. ""Everything is normal.""

Checks were still being carried out to determine the number injured, he said, urging people not to venture outdoors and to be prepared for aftershocks.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a separate news conference earlier in Tokyo that almost 850,000 households had been left without power in areas surrounding Tokyo and northern Japan.

""Where the tremor was felt the strongest, there is higher risk of structural collapse and landslides,"" a spokeswoman for the Japan Meteorological Agency told press in Tokyo. Adding that people should be cautious about tremors.

Fukushima became synonymous with nuclear disaster in March 2011 when the area was hit by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake — the strongest in Japan's history. A tsunami soon followed, leaving more than 15,000 people dead and 2,500 others still missing.

The deadly wall of water slammed through the walls of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, knocking out the power supply and causing three nuclear reactors to melt, spewing radioactive particles into the air. It will take decades to safely shut down the plant.

Space to store the 1 million tons of water — equal to 400 Olympic-size swimming pools — that must be pumped through the reactor to keep the fuel cool, is also running out. While the water has been treated to remove most of the dangerous radioactive components, traces of tritium remain.

Kato said the plant was being inspected but there was ""no concern of a damage-causing tsunami"" and ""no anomalies"" had been reported at the site. Investigations were continuing to make sure there was no structural damage, he added.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the plant, also tweeted that it had checked its facilities and ""no abnormalities"" had been detected.

In a sign of rebirth, Fukushima had been due to host parts of the Summer Olympics set to take place in Japan in 2020. However, the games were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

Iran’s oil production and exports are rising faster than projected despite the Covid-19 crisis and U.S. sanctions.
Second, the Biden administration could support Iran’s loan request for funds from the International Monetary Fund.
Should Biden take any of these three steps, Iran can be expected to cease ramping up its nuclear program.","funds, stalemate, opinion, irans, jcpoa, sanctions, biden, iran, iranian, bidens, deal, oil, administration, solutions, nuclear",nuclear,Man-Made Disaster,"With neither Washington nor Tehran aiming to be the first to come back into full compliance with the deal, Biden needs to find a way to do something artful and difficult: Get both sides to restore compliance at the same time. This approach may be the most palatable option, but it will require significant technical discussions between the two sides. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has indicated Iran would be open to such an approach, stating that it may be possible to “choreograph” the mutual restoration of commitments with the Biden administration.

But Biden must open the door for these direct talks. His first step must be significant enough to restore belief in the original “win-win” logic of the deal and offer Iranian officials a credible rationale for engagement with the U.S. At the same time, it may be limited enough to keep the U.S. outside of the deal, offering him political cover with critics and underscoring the necessity for Iran to also take reciprocal steps.

Taking this kind of first step could, in its way, be a signal of strength for Biden: He’d be showing domestic opponents of the JCPOA that he will not be bullied into compromising his Iran policy. The fight over the appointment of Robert Malley as Iran envoy showed that hawks will “play dirty” to undermine the credibility of Biden’s outreach to Iran. Biden ought to nip this kind of cynical politics in the bud.

If Biden goes go this route, officials in the U.S., Europe, and Iran are currently deliberating what a reasonable first move could be. Our conversations with officials suggest that there is awareness that breaking out of the political deadlock may require Biden to be bold. He has a few options.

First, the Biden administration could restore temporary waivers that enable Iran to sell oil while U.S. sanctions remain in place. Iran’s oil production and exports are rising faster than projected despite the Covid-19 crisis and U.S. sanctions. This trend has reduced the perceived urgency of restoring the nuclear deal among key political stakeholders in Tehran who may gain more power after the upcoming Iranian presidential election. The Biden administration’s efforts to re-enter the JCPOA would be best served by making already increasing oil sales once again subject to the “win-win” logic of the nuclear deal. Iran’s earnings from these oil sales would be accrued in escrow accounts and subject to strict oversight as per the waiver terms. Revenues would be used by Iran for sanctions-exempt trade with the country in which the funds are held. Such a step would serve to remove a key piece of tension with U.S. allies such as South Korea, Japan, and India whose energy security has been impacted by U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Second, the Biden administration could support Iran’s loan request for funds from the International Monetary Fund. Iran’s request has languished despite the IMF’s technical assessment that Iran qualifies for financial support to address the balance of payments crisis created by the pandemic. Iran has indicated it is ready for these funds to be disbursed to its accounts outside of the country to be used for paying for sanctions-exempt imports. The funds would not flow directly into Iranian government coffers, but rather be used to address trade deficits. The Biden administration should grant this loan as part of its commitment to address the humanitarian impact of sanctions and a wider push to encourage the IMF to use its full financial capacities to address the ongoing economic crisis brought on by the pandemic.

Finally, a third option could be easing Iran’s access to its existing foreign exchange reserves. Presently, Iran has free and ready access to an estimated 10 percent of its reserves, a circumstance that has placed extraordinary pressure on Iran’s currency and generated high levels of inflation that harm ordinary Iranians. Iran has been engaged in fraught negotiations with numerous countries to try and get access to frozen assets, who continue to look to the U.S. Treasury Department for the final say. The Biden administration could give these countries, including allies Germany and South Korea, the approvals and guidance necessary to enable both central and commercial banks to readily execute payments on behalf of Iranian account holders. As with the oil waivers and IMF loan, these payments can be restricted to sanctions-exempt trade, a key outcome of which would be lower rates of inflation.

Should Biden take any of these three steps, Iran can be expected to cease ramping up its nuclear program. Neither country would be fully implementing its commitments under the JCPOA, but an opportunity will have been created for new talks in the spirit of “win-win” diplomacy. There is no guarantee that these talks, and the complicated choreography of JCPOA restoration, will succeed. But Biden needs to give himself a shot. After the last four years, timid gestures will fail to do that. It’s time to be bold."

Updated at 11:30 a.m. ET

The United States and Iran remain at odds over what comes next in their standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Iran's supreme leader said Sunday that all U.S. sanctions must be lifted before Tehran will return to its commitment under the 2015 nuclear deal. And, in an interview airing Sunday, President Biden said the United States won't lift sanctions first.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's remarks to an audience of military commanders confirmed Tehran's position that all sanctions must be lifted before Iran resumes full compliance with the deal's limits to its nuclear program. The remarks were carried by Iranian state television.

In the past, President Hassan Rouhani has said Iran could return to compliance within hours of the U.S. sanctions being lifted.

But on Sunday Khamenei appeared to suggest a longer timeline. ""The U.S. must lift all sanctions in practice, then we will do verification and see if the sanctions were lifted correctly, then we will return to our commitments,"" he said.

In an interview, CBS Evening News's Norah O'Donnell asked Biden: ""Will the U.S. lift sanctions first in order to get Iran back to the negotiating table?""

""No,"" he responded.

""They have to stop enriching uranium first?"" O'Donnell asked.

Biden nodded affirmatively.

The Trump administration re-imposed the sanctions on Iran in 2018 — as part of what U.S. officials called a ""maximum pressure"" campaign — after pulling the U.S. out of the agreement between Iran and six world powers. Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for eased sanctions.

Iranian semi-official media reported last month that Tehran was enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity at its underground Fordow nuclear facility, breaching limits in the agreement. That level of enriched uranium can be used to make medical isotopes. Enrichment at 90% is required to make a nuclear weapon.

After years of escalating tensions under Trump, the Biden administration says it plans to work to ""get back to diplomacy"" in an effort to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said late last month that Trump-era policies had worsened an ""escalating nuclear crisis"" with Iran.

""Iran's nuclear program has advanced dramatically over the course of the past couple years,"" said Sullivan, who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal for the Obama administration. ""They are significantly closer to a nuclear weapon than they were when the previous administration withdrew from the [nuclear deal]. Their ballistic missile capability has also advanced dramatically.""

U.S. tensions with Iran have been high for decades, and rose dramatically after the killing early last year of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force. Days later, Iran fired ballistic missiles at bases hosting U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq.

A top Iranian scientist believed to be responsible for developing the country's military nuclear program was killed in a November 2020 attack Iranian officials blamed on Israel, prompting threats of retaliation from Iran's top leaders.

Then in December, the Trump administration announced sanctions on two Iranian officials over the disappearance and probable death of Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who went missing in Iran in 2007 during an unauthorized mission for the CIA."

The United States and Russia have finalised an agreement to extend until 2026 a treaty limiting their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START Treaty), which was due to expire on Friday, imposes limits on Russian and US intercontinental missiles and bombers, but does not cover new types of weapons.

Both Washington and Moscow cast the extension as a victory, saying it would provide stability and transparency on nuclear issues while acknowledging some of their disagreements.

“Even as we work with Russia to advance U.S. interests, so too will we work to hold Russia to account for adversarial actions as well as its human rights abuses,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

Blinken said Washington would use the five-year extension to pursue additional limits on all of Russia’s nuclear weapons.

“President [Joe] Biden has made clear that the New START Treaty extension is only the beginning of our efforts to address 21st Century security challenges,” he said.





Russia and the US last week announced plans to extend the agreement, even as the Biden administration has stepped up criticism of Russia over the jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, its alleged involvement in a massive US government hack and other issues.

The New START Treaty, which went into effect in 2011, limits the US and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each and imposes restrictions on the land and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.

The outgoing Trump administration made a late bid to extend the treaty, but Russia rejected its conditions.

Both houses of the Russian parliament voted unanimously last month for the extension, and President Vladimir Putin signed the bill.

That was after Biden and Putin talked and agreed on the extension, part of a quick round of diplomacy by the new US administration. The extension does not require formal approval by the US Congress.

In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said the diplomatic notes needed to formally extend New START had been exchanged on Wednesday. A US official confirmed the exchange.

The Russian statement did not address wider disputes with the US, including Washington’s condemnation of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

But Russia’s foreign ministry criticised the US for pulling out of other arms control pacts under former President Donald Trump.

Trump had tried and failed to tie the New START Treaty to three-way talks with China covering its far smaller arsenal.

“We expect that the (New START) understanding … would allow (us) to leave behind the trend towards dismantling of arms control and non-proliferation mechanisms, so prevalent in recent years due to US destructive policies,” the Russian ministry said.

Tom Collina of Ploughshares Fund, which advocates for the elimination of nuclear weapons, said Russia’s priority in any new accord would be dealing with the threat it sees to its long-range strategic nuclear arsenal from US missile defences.

Washington, for its part, likely will seek to limit Moscow’s vast short-range nuclear arsenal, Collina told the Reuters news agency."

Extending the treaty made “the world safer,” he said, adding that “unconstrained nuclear competition would endanger us all.”

The move was welcomed by the Russian Embassy in Washington, which said in a statement that the treaty was a “cornerstone of international security.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill extending the treaty Friday after both houses of the Russian parliament voted unanimously to extend it.

New START “ makes it possible to maintain the transparency and predictability of strategic relations between Russia and the United States and to support global strategic stability,” the Kremlin said in a statement at the time.

Signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia, the agreement placed the lowest limits in decades on American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads, and the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.

The Trump administration’s efforts to secure a shorter arms control agreement with Russia that included a freeze on all nuclear warheads and the future inclusion of China ultimately ended in stalemate.

Blinken said the Biden administration will use the five-year extension to pursue an arms control treaty that addresses all U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, as well as “arms control to reduce the dangers from China’s modern and growing nuclear arsenal.”

The five-year extension comes less than 24 hours after the U.S. criticized the nearly three-year prison sentence handed to Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, along with other members of the Group of Seven, or G-7 — the informal group of seven large industrialized countries including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Condemning his “politically motivated arrest and detention,” they called for Navalny’s immediate and unconditional release.

Navalny, 44, was arrested at a Moscow airport last month after he returned to his homeland from Germany. He had been receiving treatment in Berlin after he was poisoned by the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in Siberia last summer.

Navalny and his allies have accused Putin of being behind the attack, a claim that the Kremlin vehemently denies.

Navalny's detention is part of a larger review that Biden has ordered of Russia’s malign activities, including Russian interference in the 2020 election, the alleged bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and the SolarWinds breach — a suspected Russian hacking campaign that targeted American government agencies and corporations."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s energy minister said on Tuesday it would take Iran around six months to produce enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon, a timeline almost twice as long as that anticipated by a senior member of the Biden administration.

Israel is wary of the Biden administration’s intent to reenter the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and has long opposed the agreement. Washington argues that the previous Trump administration’s withdrawal from the deal backfired by prompting Iran to abandon caps on nuclear activities.

Speaking last month a day before he took office as U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken said that the so-called “breakout time” - in which Iran might ramp up enrichment of uranium to bomb-fuel purity - “has gone from beyond a year (under the deal) to about three or four months”. He said he based his comments on information in public reporting.

But Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, in a radio interview, said the Trump administration “seriously damaged Iran’s nuclear project and entire force build-up”.

“In terms of enrichment, they (Iranians) are in a situation of breaking out in around half a year if they do everything required,” he told public broadcaster Kan. “As for nuclear weaponry, the range is around one or two years.”

Iran, which denies seeking nuclear weaponry, has recently accelerated its breaches of the deal, which it started violating in 2019 response to the U.S. withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions against it.

The last quarterly estimates by the U.N. nuclear watchdog in November show that Iran’s stock of enriched uranium had risen to 2.4 tonnes, more than 10 times the amount allowed under the deal but still a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it had before.

Since then Iran has started enriching uranium to higher purity, returning to the 20% it achieved before the deal from a previous maximum of 4.5%. The deal sets a limit of 3.67%, far below the 90% that is weapons grade."

EDF's thirty-two 900 MW reactors are the oldest reactors in operation in France and were initially designed for 40 years of operation.

""ASN considers that the measures planned by EDF combined with those prescribed by ASN open the prospect of continued operation of these reactors for a further 10 years following their fourth periodic safety review,"" it said.

Continued operation required updating of design studies or equipment replacements, ASN said.

The resolution sets out improvements and measures to be applied during the reactors' fourth 10-year overhauls (VD4).

Two have already been completed at Tricastin 1 and Bugey 2. The full program is scheduled to run until 2031.

EDF's Grand Carenage program to extend the lifespan of the 900 MW fleet is estimated to cost Eur49.4 billion ($60.4 billion) for the period to 2025, according to EDF's annual report.

The review and measures planned by EDF were subject to a public consultation under HCTISN (French High Committee for Transparency and Information on Nuclear Security), ASN said.

French nuclear output fell 2020 to a record-low 335 TWh mainly due to coronavirus related maintenance adjustments, but also closure of the two 900 MW reactors at Fessenheim and extended outages at Flamanville, Paluel and Bugey.

France in 2017 postponed plans to reduce the share of nuclear in its power mix to 50% by 10 years to 2035 allowing for extended operation and lifespan extension of the 900 MW fleet.

Under a new PPE energy roadmap four to six reactors would close by 2028 and 14 by 2035. EDF named seven sites where it would shut units (Blayais, Bugey, Chinon, Cruas, Dampierre, Gravelines, Tricastin)."

The prefectures particularly hard hit by the disaster were those in closest vicinity to the powerplant, particularly Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Chiba.
Egypt abolished all import restrictions in November 2020, followed by Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates in December, and most recently Israel last month.
“So far out of the 54 countries/region that implemented import control measures on Japanese foods, Japan has managed to get restrictions removed from 39 countries or regions worldwide [including ​the Philippines​​ and Middle Eastern countries],”​ said MOFA.
Almost 40% of eligible voters at the 2018 referendum held on abolishing the ‘nuclear foods’ ban voted to continue banning these imports.","import, foods, stricken, food, progress, japan, worldwide, left, mofa, countries, south, restricting, fukushima, radioactive, japanese, restrictions, nuclear",nuclear,Man-Made Disaster,"Over the past few months, several countries in the Middle East have progressively removed all import restrictions previously imposed on foods coming in from Japanese prefectures within the vicinity of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster, deemed to be associated with radioactive ‘nuclear food’.

The prefectures particularly hard hit by the disaster were those in closest vicinity to the powerplant, particularly Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Chiba.

Egypt abolished all import restrictions in November 2020, followed by Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates in December, and most recently Israel last month.

“The Government of Japan welcomes this decision by the Government of Israel [to] remove all regulatory measures to mandate inspections or radioactive material inspection reports for all food products from [Japan],”​ said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MOFA) via a formal statement.

“The Israeli government undertook regulatory measures [to control food imports from] the prefectures [affected by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power station accident] exported to the country, but it has been confirmed that these regulations have been abolished as of January 2021.”​

According to MOFA data, this means that there are now just 15 countries or regions left worldwide that continue to impose any form of import restrictions on foods from Japan – restrictions that the country has repeatedly insisted are ‘not scientific’​.

Of these, 10 still allow imports based on certain conditions: Indonesia, French Polynesia, the United States, the EU, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Russia and Singapore still require certifications, inspections or other documentation before allowing entry.

Singapore​ for instance still requires a certificate of production origin for products from the relevant prefectures, and a certificate of radionuclide pre-testing on products from Fukushima.

“The test certificate is to certify that the food has been tested and no radioactive contaminants were detected above 100 Bq/kg for radioactive caesium,”​ a Singapore Food Agency (SFA) spokeswoman said.

The other five countries still maintaining strict bans on foods from the affected Japanese prefectures are ironically some of those closest to it geographically: South Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau and Japan has been working particularly hard to repair its reputation here.

“So far out of the 54 countries/region that implemented import control measures on Japanese foods, Japan has managed to get restrictions removed from 39 countries or regions worldwide [including ​the Philippines​​ and Middle Eastern countries],”​ said MOFA.

“[Before COVID-19 hit], many efforts have made to repair the reputational damage cause by the nuclear disaster, including trying to transmit [what the situation is like on the ground] to foreigners via foreign media and expatriates in Japan, [including those] from South Korea and China.​

In addition, MOFA stressed that it already had ‘ambassadors [in charge of] international trade at work in the capitals of each country’​ and had dedicated resources to clearly communicate Japan’s efforts to ensure local food safety in its efforts to remove all bans.

“Japan’s food goes through strict food monitoring, and utilizes very strict reference tests so as to be internationally comparable, and a system is set up to prevent any foods with [radioactive material] values above reference values to enter the market - [Our ambassadors are] explaining these efforts to countries/regions that maintain entry barriers and regulations,”​ said the ministry.

“We are also utilizing various diplomatic opportunities such as talks and international conferences, and working with the Prime Minister and MOFA Minister ​Toshimitsu Motegi on getting these messages through].”​

Remaining countries likely hard to crack​

Despite the enormous progress that has been made, MOFA and the Japanese government as a whole likely still has a long and difficult journey ahead when it comes to getting regulations relaxed in the remaining five countries.

South Korea’s ban on Fukushima seafood was initially deemed by a WTO dispute body to be ‘arbitrarily and unjustifiably discriminate against Japanese products’​​, and was set to be lifted in 2018, but was overturned by the WTO Appellate Body in 2019 after an appeal.

The trade restrictions have remained in place since and WTO’s move has set a precedent that likely makes it harder for such cases to easily move forward, despite Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) emphasizing that it ‘did not acknowledge that South Korea’s measures comply with WTO rules’​.

“There is no change in Japan’s position of demanding that South Korea lift all the restrictions and we will pursue this via talks with South Korea,”​ said the ministry in a statement.

In Taiwan, there has been adamant resistance against the import of ‘nuclear foods’, although many are claiming the motivation for this to be more political than scientific​ and a scheme by opposition political party Kuomintang, which submitted a referendum request in 2018 to continue the ban, to stir the waters.

Almost 40% of eligible voters at the 2018 referendum held on abolishing the ‘nuclear foods’ ban voted to continue banning these imports. This ban has also continued till date despite great risk to Taiwan’s bilateral trade ties with Japan​, and it will be unlikely that any headway can be made until the political aspects to this are solved.

China on the other hand has been amicably discussing the lifting of import restrictions with Japan for several years, but till date bans have only been lifted for one food item, which is rice from Niigata prefecture.

Records published on MOFA of a conversation between the foreign ministers of both China and Japan in 2020 only included an agreement to ‘communicate closely’ ​on this issue, but no specific further progress."

Nuclear power's safety record is actually impressive

Unfortunately, there is a strong link in the public mind between nuclear power and nuclear weapons — and the memories of three nuclear accidents at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima served to cement the searing rejection of nuclear power in the minds of many.

However, it's rarely reported that these accidents reified the overwhelming safety of nuclear energy — considering the harm other forms of energy generation have done. No one died from escaped radiation at Three Mile Island or Fukushima — and not even 50 people died from the landmark Chernobyl meltdown, and the years since.

Small modular reactors offer smaller, more flexible rollouts

However, in light of the growing energy needs of the world, large-scale nuclear power might not offer the best energy solutions. Large-scale investments like the out-of-control construction costs of Hinkley Point C in the U.K. have shown how difficult nuclear power at scale can be compared to more conventional technology, like fossil fuels.

This is why small modular reactors (SMRs) have gained major interest as a possible means of giving the nuclear industry new life in the 21st century. According to the Atomic Energy Agency, SMR facilities are nuclear power plants producing less than 300 MWe of power.

Since SMRs are small and flexible enough to go up in several disparate environments, they have far fewer logistical obstacles compared to traditional nuclear power plants. But SMRs still face technological and financial challenges to acceptance and implementation globally while firms and nations gain interest.

Rolls-Royce building 16 nuclear reactors in the UK

As leader of a consortium, Rolls-Royce announced plans in 2020 to build up to 16 mini-nuclear plants in the U.K. — potentially creating 6,000 new jobs in the Midlands and North England through the next five years.

This is significant to the U.K. because nuclear power will help the nation meet its net-zero emissions target before 2050 hits. The new SMR reactors will fill an energy gap in the country's power network stemming from an approaching expiration date for six of the U.K.'s seven nuclear reactors — which are slated to go offline before 2030 — with the final one called Sizewell B expected to be decommissioned in 2035.

Smaller nuclear reactors are better than larger ones because they save both private investors and public departments from having to undertake colossal nuclear mega-projects in difficult local environments.

Small modular reactors could hit US market this decade

In the U.S., GE Hitachi is developing an SMR called the BWRX-300 — which could reduce plant size up to 90% compared to the traditional lamp-shade smokestacks we're familiar with.

Crucially, the BWRX-300 is one of the only SMRs under development in the country. As of writing, it's undergoing a licensing process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and could reach the energy market before the decade is out. GE Hitachi's design is a 300-MW electric light water reactor designed to produce steam inside the reactor pressure vessel — cutting complexity.

With South Korea, France, and other nations aiming to shut down much of their nuclear power capabilities in favor of other resources like offshore wind-farms, the potential for small modular reactors is often passed over in official discussions, despite nuclear power's impressive safety record. For or against, the conversation on nuclear power needs to be revisited as new, more compact models hit the market.

Correction: This article has been updated. The text previously stated the BWRX-300 SMR was the only one in development in the U.S. It is not. This has been updated to reflect that the BWRX-300 is one of the only SMRs in development in the country. IE regrets this error."

Ten years after a tsunami hit the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, controversy and doubts over its clean-up efforts continue to dog the industry. And the voices calling for the government to embrace alternative, greener forms of energy and to decommission its nuclear reactors have only grown louder.

After Fukushima was swamped by a tsunami that left three of its reactors in meltdown in 2011, its opaque decommissioning process has ensured the crippled plant remains in the spotlight as authorities debate what to do with the nearly 1.25 million tonnes of radioactive water used to cool the melted reactors down.

The contaminated water is currently housed in about 1,000 thousand metal tanks on the grounds of the plant and the authorities say that there is little space for more.

Widely reported plans to dump the water into the Pacific Ocean have created national and international alarm. The concern has delayed the authorities’ decision about the radioactive waters’ release but no answers have been forthcoming since then.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, touring the nearby city of Minamisoma on Saturday, said that the water disposal policy would be decided “at an appropriate time and in a responsible manner.” But he added: “We can’t delay our decision indefinitely”.

The plant’s owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has treated the contaminated water through what it calls the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS), noting on its website that this “eventually removes most of the radioactive materials except Tritium.”

Tritium, explains Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is “one of the least harmful” radioactive isotopes, and may not pose any significant threat to human health.

Much larger amounts of Tritium have already been deposited in the seas, since hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are allowed to release it and because nuclear weapons tests conducted in the Pacific in the 1950s also discharged it into the surrounding oceans.

However, Buesseler says there are more serious grounds for concern about the other more dangerous elements that will be discharged when water from the Fukushima Daiichi is let out into the sea.

Unlike the gases that escaped from the plant in high volumes in the early months of the crisis, he says, the kinds of radioactive contamination found in the waters used to cool the reactors is “a completely different beast” that includes far more dangerous isotopes such as Cobalt-60, Strontium-90, and Caesium.

By TEPCO’s own account, ALPS has “reduced” concentrations of these much more concerning isotopes but it has not eliminated them.

“What else is in the tanks is an important question before you decide what to do with it,” cautioned Buesseler, one of the world’s top experts on the issue.

While the data issued by TEPCO is incomplete, Buesseler estimates that about 70 percent of the “treated” Fukushima water in the tanks needs additional processing and that independent experts need to be brought in as part of a careful verification process.

Trust undermined

The challenge faced by the Japanese government and TEPCO is also a legacy of poor communication, concealment and misinformation about nuclear safety issues at the Fukushima plant.

“It was always: ‘Trust us, and we’ll engineer solutions’,” noted Buesseler, “I think they lost the public trust very early… So once you lose that trust, it’s hard to rebuild, and I think that still plagues them to this day.”

In the months and years that followed the 2011 disaster, a series of revelations badly damaged TEPCO’s reputation.

One of the gravest charges was that the company’s own internal studies had concluded prior to the accident that the plant might be vulnerable to a large tsunami and needed a protective barrier.

The finding was later rejected because top executives felt that the construction of the wall would be too expensive. But even after the disaster happened TEPCO and the government regulators continued to argue that such a large tsunami hitting the plant had been “unforeseeable.”

In the months after the accident, all 54 of Japan’s nuclear reactors were taken offline and the government put new safety regulations in place. The discredited Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) was replaced by the Nuclear Regulation Agency (NRA), thought to be less under the government’s thumb.

But these measures have done little ease people’s concerns about the risks of nuclear power.

A large public opinion poll conducted by national broadcaster NHK at the end of last year found that only 3 percent of the Japanese public believed that nuclear power should be expanded, compared with 50 percent who felt that it should be reduced and 17 percent who wanted its immediate abolition.

The Japanese government’s current energy plans, however, call for a significant expansion of nuclear power arguing that it remains a dependable energy source that does not contribute to climate change.

In the 10 years since the Fukushima disaster, the pro-nuclear government and the anti-nuclear citizen activists brought various cases to court and now appear to be at an impasse. The anti-nuclear camp was not able to prevent the government from restarting Japan’s nuclear plants – but Tokyo has not been able to achieve the nuclear goals it originally set out for itself.

“Even 10 years after the Fukushima accident, the government and the incumbent utilities could only reopen nine reactors,” observed Mika Ohbayashi, the director of the Tokyo-based Renewable Energy Institute. The country had 54 reactors in operation before the tsunami struck.

Today, nuclear power only contributes a little over 7 percent towards the nation’s electricity supply – not between 20 and 22 percent as originally planned, powered by the restarting of about 30 reactors. Few independent observers regard the plan as plausible.

Deep divisions

Many activists, among them Caitlin Stronell, the editor of Nuke Info Tokyo at the Citizen’s Nuclear Information Center in the Japanese capital, are flummoxed by the Japanese government’s resistance to what they regard as the obvious and only viable solution going forward – an substantial shift towards renewable energies such as solar and wind power.

Stronell scoffs at arguments that renewables are not a viable solution for Japan due to engineering challenges.

“They think that they can look after radioactive fuel for 10,000 years. They have the technology for that,” she said. “But they can’t save sunshine overnight in a battery?”

Stronell believes that the falling costs of renewables and the rising costs, financial and political, of trying to build nuclear plants and the disposing of radioactive waste may make the outcome a foregone conclusion.

“Even if it’s a business decision, nuclear power just doesn’t pay any more. It’s really expensive,” she said.

Even as Japan and the world mark 10 years since Japan’s magnitude 9.0 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, there is much ground that remains contested.

Kyle Cleveland, an associate professor at Temple University Japan and co-editor of the forthcoming book Legacies of Fukushima: 3/11 in Context, observes: “Fukushima sits behind Chernobyl as the one of the most significant nuclear accidents in world history.”

Chernobyl released more radiation into the environment and killed more people, but the fallout from Fukushima – the world’s second-worst civilian nuclear disaster – continues to be felt, affecting Japan’s economy – especially in Fukushima Prefecture – and colouring the debate over its national energy policy.

The impact of radiation on human health also remains under scrutiny, whether it be encouraging Fukushima residents to return to their homes, or the decision of what to do with the water used to cool the melted reactors.

There remains no common ground between the pro-nuclear Japanese government camp and the anti-nuclear activists who challenge them – even on basic medical facts.

“Often when people are debating radiation effects, they aren’t really talking about radiation,” Cleveland said. “They are talking about politics. It’s a proxy for politics.”"

Just like planet-heating fossil fuels, the legacy of nuclear power poses threats on a timescale that stretches well beyond human comprehension.
Yet costs and the industry’s inertia aren’t the only reason why nuclear energy never gained much traction in Southeast Asia.
According to the World Nuclear Association, nuclear power plants can be designed to withstand earthquakes.
Vietnam came closest to constructing its first nuclear power station, but it scrapped its plans in 2016.","plants, asia, solar, costs, southeast, dream, energy, power, electricity, wind, decade, fukushima, bury, nuclear, industry",nuclear,Man-Made Disaster,"Every now and then, the debate resurfaces over whether nuclear power has a role to play in Southeast Asia’s energy transition. But as Japan marks a decade since the Fukushima disaster, the region needs to move on and see the technology for what it is: a dangerous and costly distraction.

It’s obvious why nuclear power plants are appealing. Unlike wind turbines and solar panels, they can—in theory—run around the clock, uninterrupted by the whims of nature, and generate stable baseload electricity that could directly replace polluting coal.

Desperate to save itself from decline, the nuclear sector has peddled the myth that nuclear energy—clean, reliable and cost-effective as it allegedly is—is key to decarbonising the global economy.

Except it isn’t. Economics have long conspired against the industry as it built ever larger and more complex reactors. From China to the United States, projects have run years behind schedule, leading to budget overruns, and rendering the technology uncompetitive.

Things don’t get better when decommissioning costs, which can reach well into billions, are taken into account. And make no mistake, once power plants are taken down, it is ratepayers who will be hit in the pocket.

Adding to this is the expensive storage of nuclear waste. The truth is, the industry has yet to come up with a solution to permanently dispose of radioactive materials, some of which will remain hazardous for tens of thousands of years. Many experts doubt a solution will ever be found.

Until feasible options emerge, nuclear waste is usually kept on site and must be guarded and secured even after plants cease operations. This drives up costs further.

From shooting it into space to dumping it on isolated islands, all sorts of ludicrous ideas have been proposed for dealing with radioactive waste but—not surprisingly—most have been rejected as impractical, irresponsible, or too costly.

Neither is there a reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps. Just like planet-heating fossil fuels, the legacy of nuclear power poses threats on a timescale that stretches well beyond human comprehension.

In response to economic headwinds, nuclear engineers have been busy developing cheaper, modular reactors featuring simpler designs and streamlined construction processes. But many energy experts deem these ambitions a mere pipe dream.

Despite the industry’s enthusiasm, a 2019 industry report concluded that nuclear will never make a significant contribution to tackling climate change, and that money poured into nuclear projects was diverting resources away from better ways to cut emissions.

The study, titled World Nuclear Industry Status Report, found that cash pumped into energy efficiency saved four times as much carbon as money spent on nuclear power; wind saved three times as much, and solar double.

As of 2020, the cost of generating new utility-scale solar power was US$30-60 per megawatt-hour in Europe and the United States, and as low as US$20-40 per megawatt-hour in China and India, International Energy Agency data shows. Nuclear power cost between US$112 and US$189 in 2019. The technology is the epitome of a stranded asset.

As renewable energy costs keep dropping, nuclear surely isn’t worth the hassle, and despite what the industry says, it isn’t needed.

A 2020 report by research group Wood Mackenzie showed most markets in Asia Pacific will see the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind fall below coal’s this decade. Thailand and Vietnam are expected to join China with lower clean energy costs compared to coal as early as this year.

Meanwhile, it has been proven that electricity systems can accommodate larger shares of intermittent renewables without experiencing power cuts in countries like Denmark, which sourced 47 per cent of its electricity from wind in 2019, and Germany, where the share of renewable energy in the generation mix climbed to 46 per cent last year.

There are plenty of ways to handle volatile clean energy output. In Southeast Asia, it will require both investment in transmission infrastructure and backup solutions, but it can be done. Battery storage is becoming increasingly viable, with the average cost of a lithium-ion battery pack dropping 88 per cent over the past decade. In Asia Pacific, solar projects coupled with storage are estimated to become competitive with gas by 2026.

In the coming years, Southeast Asia will also continue building out the Asean Power Grid, enabling countries to transfer surplus electricity to neighbours. Wider geographic distribution of clean power generation will ensure that diverse green energy sources complement each other. In addition, energy planners could deploy pumped-storage hydropower or modify consumer demand to adapt to fluctuating electricity supply.

And by the time Southeast Asia reaches similar levels of wind and solar penetration as European nations, novel solutions will emerge. Green hydrogen, which will unlock potential to buffer intermittent daily and seasonal power generation and decarbonise heavy industry, is projected to be competitive with fossil fuels in Japan, Germany, and Australia by 2030. Technology transfer and conducive policies will ensure that Southeast Asian nations will not be far behind.

Last year, an energy expert from Indonesia told me that adding renewables alone may work well in Europe’s advanced economies, but that Southeast Asia’s rapid energy demand growth—which is among the fastest in the world—called for other sources of power. “Renewables have never been the solution to provide energy for developing countries,” he said.

But if the region needs energy so urgently, one has to wonder why governments would toy with the idea of building nuclear energy plants that take five to 17 years longer to build than utility-scale solar or on-shore wind power. Slow coal power development has already prompted Vietnam to pivot towards cleaner alternatives. Why replace one sluggish technology with another?

I’m not saying nuclear projects operating elsewhere in the world today should be switched off tomorrow. By all means, keep them running until countries have the means to replace them with green alternatives. But when building new capacity, economics and project timelines simply do not work in the sector’s favour.

Yet costs and the industry’s inertia aren’t the only reason why nuclear energy never gained much traction in Southeast Asia. There is also the sector’s poor reputation it earned from the two major nuclear disasters that occurred over its 70-year history.

According to the World Nuclear Association, nuclear power plants can be designed to withstand earthquakes. Once the ground shakes, they shut down, as did 11 nuclear plants in Japan when a magnitude-9 quake hit in March 2011.

That didn’t prevent the tsunami that followed from broaching the Fukushima power plant’s sea defences and causing the failure of emergency generators required to keep the reactors cool. The subsequent meltdowns prompted authorities to evacuate more than 154,000 people living in surrounding towns, and estimates put the clean-up costs at US$300 billion.

Earthquake-proofing wouldn’t have averted the 1986 Chernobyl disaster either, which was the result of a flawed reactor design combined with human error. From wildfires to floods, there are myriad other potential risks that might jeopardise reactor safety.

Can power plant operators ever completely rule out the risk of nuclear accidents? Every nuclear energy expert I have spoken with conceded they can’t.

The Philippines is the only Southeast Asian state to have built a nuclear power station, 100 kilometres west of its capital Manila. Completed in 1985, the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant cost over US$2.3 billion, and it never went into operation.

In the wake of Chernobyl, Philippine authorities decided it was safer to mothball the facility. It wasn’t until 2008 that the loan for the project was paid off, the same energy analyst from Indonesia told me.

Even during construction, the project was mired in controversy. Plagued with problems, the venture quickly saw cost estimates balloon to levels three times higher than the original proposal, which promised a reactor with double the generation capacity the country ended up with.

Other countries in the region have floated proposals for nuclear power, but most have been abandoned due to rising costs and safety concerns. Vietnam came closest to constructing its first nuclear power station, but it scrapped its plans in 2016. Malaysia said in 2018 it had no plans for nuclear power, while Thailand’s ambitions to develop a 20-megawatt research reactor have been delayed for two decades.

Only Indonesia and the Philippines have proposed regulatory changes to revive dormant nuclear energy plans, despite a suspected case of nuclear waste dumping in a residential area near Jakarta last year. The Philippine government is also mulling turning on the Bataan plant, although that will take some convincing of the public.

Ultimately, the country would be better off keeping the site what it currently is: a tourist attraction."

The country had previously been reducing its nuclear weapons stockpile, and in 2010, the government set a cap of 180 warheads for the mid-2020 period. Johnson scrapped the earlier limit and said the number would now rise to a maximum of 260.

In its security and defence review, Britain said it faced risks from nuclear-armed states, emerging nuclear states and state-sponsored nuclear terrorism, and its nuclear deterrent was needed to guarantee its security and that of its allies.

“Some states are now significantly increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals,” the government said. “The increase in global competition, challenges to the international order, and proliferation of potentially disruptive technologies all pose a threat to strategic stability.”

The move was criticised by The Elders, a group of former global policymakers who campaign for peace.

“While the UK cites increased security threats as justification for this move, the appropriate response to these challenges should be to work multilaterally to strengthen international arms control agreements and to reduce - not increase - the number of nuclear weapons in existence,” said Mary Robinson, chair of the group.

Questioned over the policy in parliament Johnson said Britain was still committed to global nuclear arms reduction.

Britain also said it planned to replace its current nuclear warhead with a new one which would be able to operate throughout the lifespan of four new submarines being built and due to enter service in the early 2030s.

It will work with the United States to ensure the new warhead remains Trident-compatible.

The review also warns of the “realistic possibility” that a terrorist group will “launch a successful CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear] attack by 2030”, although there is little extra detail to back up this assessment.

It includes a personal commitment from Johnson, as a last-minute addition in the foreword, to restore foreign aid spending to 0.7% of national income “when the fiscal situation allows”, after fierce criticism of cuts in relief to Yemen and elsewhere.

The 100-page document says the increase in the nuclear warheads cap is “in recognition of the evolving security environment” and that there are “developing range of technological and doctrinal threats”.

Campaigners warned the UK was at risk of starting a “new nuclear arms race” at a time when the world is trying to emerge from the Covid pandemic. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), said: “With the government strapped for cash, we don’t need grandiose, money-wasting spending on weapons of mass destruction.”

The commitment is one of the most notable in the integrated review, a landmark post-Brexit review of defence and foreign policy, which also includes:

A clear statement that Russia under Vladimir Putin represents an “active threat” but nuanced language on China, which is described as posing a “systemic challenge” in a manner unlikely to please Conservative hawks on the party’s backbenches.

A commitment to launch an additional sanctions regime giving the UK “powers to prevent those involved in corruption from freely entering the UK or channelling money through our financial system” for the first time.

An aspiration for the UK to be a “soft power superpower” with praise for the BBC as “the most trusted broadcaster worldwide” despite Downing Street boycotting the broadcaster last year. The British monarchy is also cited as contributing.

The review began in the aftermath of the 2019 general election and is intended to help define the prime minister’s “global Britain” vision and shape future strategic direction, after leaving the EU, until 2030.

It contains only a handful of passing references to the bloc, arguing instead for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in which the UK deepens defence, diplomatic and trade relations with India, Japan, South Korea and Australia in opposition to China.

“We will be the European partner with the broadest and most integrated presence in the Indo-Pacific,” the review says, while arguing that investing in cyberwarfare capabilities and deploying the new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in the region later this year will help send a message to Beijing.

But it is the commitment to significantly increase the cap on nuclear warhead numbers that is the most significant development, coming after the UK promised to run down stockpiles following the end of the cold war.

Britain has far fewer warheads stockpiled than Russia, estimated to have 4,300, the US on 3,800 or China, which has about 320. But each warhead the UK holds is estimated to have an explosive power of 100 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the second world war was about 15 kilotons.

“A minimum, credible, independent nuclear deterrent, assigned to the defence of Nato, remains essential in order to guarantee our security and that of our allies,” the UK review says in a section explaining the context for the stockpile increase.

Stewart McDonald, the defence spokesman for the Scottish National party, which is opposed to Trident renewal, accused the government of being wedded to an outdated defence policy: “For the prime minister to stand up and champion the international rules-based system before announcing in the same breath that the UK plans to violate its commitments to the international treaty on non-proliferation beggars belief.”

China lobby groups said they believed the review did not go far enough. A spokesperson for the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China said Beijing should not have been omitted from the list of countries engaged in hostile state activities.

“This is despite repeated Chinese state-backed cyber-attacks on UK targets and attempts by Chinese government agents to intimidate and threaten UK residents on British soil – and in stark contrast to Russia, Iran and other authoritarian states that have also targeted the UK,” the spokesperson added.

Further details of the plans for the armed forces will be contained in an official defence command paper to be published on Monday. That is expected to confirm a cut in the size in the British army to 72,500 – not mentioned in the review document – and investments in pilotless killer drones.

One idea not previously mentioned is a tentative proposal to create a citizen’s volunteer force – a “civilian reservist cadre” – potentially to work alongside the military in response to the future crises on the scale of the pandemic."

U.S. President Joe Biden’s aides initially believed Iran, with which they have not had direct discussions, wanted to talk about first steps toward a revival of the agreement that Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, abandoned in 2018.

The agreement eased economic sanctions on Tehran in return for curbs to the Iranian nuclear program designed to make it harder to develop an atomic weapon - an ambition Tehran denies.

Three Western officials said the Biden administration and Iran had mainly communicated indirectly via European parties to the deal - Britain, France and Germany - and that they believe Iran now wants to discuss a broader plan to return to the pact.

“What we had heard was that they were interested first in a series of initial steps, and so we were exchanging ideas on a series of initial steps” said a U.S. official who, like others cited in this story, spoke on condition of anonymity.

“It sounds from what we are hearing publicly now, and through other means, that they may be ... not interested in (discussing) initial steps but in a road map for return to full compliance,” he said.

“If that’s what Iran wants to talk about, we are happy to talk about it,” the U.S. official added.

It is not clear, however, whether that is Iran’s stance.

Iran’s nuclear policy is ultimately determined by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who said flatly on March 21 that “the Americans must lift all sanctions” before Tehran would resume compliance.

“If sanctions are ... really canceled, we will return to our obligations without any problems,” Khamenei said. “We have a lot of patience and we are not in a hurry.”

‘NOT IN A RUSH’

Biden aides originally said that if Iran resumed compliance, the United States would too - a stance taken to mean Washington wanted Tehran to resume compliance first - but have since made clear that who goes first is not an issue.

While the Biden administration has also sought to project that it is in no hurry, it faces the reality that if there is no progress in April toward reviving the deal, Iranian officials in May will begin intense politicking for the June 18 presidential election.

“They are going to get into election period in about a month or so, but that’s not the end of the world for us,” said one Western diplomat. “We are making offers and they are making offers. It’s a slow process, but that’s OK. We’re not in a rush.”

Tehran rejected a report in the U.S. publication Politico saying Washington planned this week to put forth a new proposal that would ask Iran to halt work on advanced centrifuges and the enrichment of uranium to 20% purity in return for undefined U.S. sanctions relief.

“No proposal is needed for the US to rejoin the JCPOA,” the Iranian mission to the United Nations said on Twitter, referring to the deal formally named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “It only requires a political decision by the US to fully and immediately implement all of its obligations.”

It remains unclear whether Iran actually wants to engage, albeit indirectly, with the United States now or whether the supreme leader prefers to wait until after the election.

“I think there’s a fair bit of ambivalence from the supreme leader about rushing things,” said Henry Rome of the Eurasia Group."

The statement by Choe Son Hui, the first foreign minister, came hours before the U.S. and South Korean foreign and defense chiefs met in Seoul for their first joint talks in five years to discuss North Korea’s nuclear program.

“What has been heard from the U.S. since the emergence of the new regime is only a lunatic theory of ‘threat from North Korea’ and groundless rhetoric about ‘complete denuclearization,’” Choe said, calling the offer for talks a “time-delaying trick.”

He reiterated North Korea’s position that no “dialogue of any kind” can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostility. “Therefore, we will disregard such an attempt of the U.S. in the future, too.”

U.S.-led diplomacy focusing on North Korea’s nuclear weapons remains stalemated for about two years because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions. Experts are debating whether the United States and its allies should settle for a deal that would freeze North Korea’s nuclear activities in return for relaxing sanctions to prevent its arsenal from growing.

Earlier this week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to abandon rapprochement with South Korea and warned the United States to “refrain from causing a stink,” while criticizing regular U.S.-South Korean military drills that her government views as an invasion rehearsal.

Choe again took issue with this month’s drills, saying that the United States “openly started aggression-minded joint military exercises targeting us.”

Some experts say North Korea, which is eager to win sanctions relief, may further raise animosities with missile tests to boost its leverage in any negotiations with the United States. North Korea’s moribund economy is under additional pressure because of the pandemic-related border closure that has significantly shrunk its external trade and a spate of natural disasters last summer.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a visit to Tokyo earlier this week that Washington had reached out to North Korea through several channels, including in New York, starting in mid-February, but it hasn’t received any response. He said the Biden administration was looking forward to completing its policy review on North Korea in coming weeks and was looking both at possible “additional pressure measures” and “diplomatic paths.”

When Blinken met South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong on Wednesday, he said the U.S. will work with allies to achieve the denuclearization of North Korea and criticized what he called North Korea’s “systematic and widespread abuses against its own people.” According to the State Department, Blinken and Chung also reaffirmed a shared commitment to address North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues that they said are “a priority for the alliance.”

Choe said U.S. attempts to contact North Korea included emails and telephone messages via various channels. She said that even on the eve of its drills with South Korea, Washington sent a message “imploring us to respond to its request through a third country.”

Choe said it will “only be a waste of time to sit with the U.S.”

Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are on the first overseas trip by Cabinet-level officials since President Joe Biden took office in January. Biden is pushing to restore alliances that were frayed under his predecessor Donald Trump’s “America First” approach and bolster a U.S. leadership on the world stage in the face of growing challenges from China.

Other likely topics during Thursday’s talks in Seoul include a U.S. desire to resolve historical disputes between Seoul and Tokyo and boost a U.S.-led trilateral cooperation, and South Korea possibly joining an expanded format of the Indo-Pacific group that involves the United States, Japan, Australia and India known as the Quad.

For months, Iran has slowly been violating terms of a 2015 deal designed to limit its nuclear program. It has been accumulating enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear reactors or, potentially, nuclear weapons. It's been ramping up its research and development.

But until recently, there was one thing Iran didn't touch: the nuclear inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

""Iran tends to stay away from pestering the IAEA,"" says Dina Esfandiary of the International Crisis Group.

That is now changing. Almost three years after the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed harsh sanctions, Iran has begun limiting access to the nuclear inspectors who keep watch over its program.

While the IAEA has found a temporary workaround, it appears that its nuclear inspectors may soon lose access to sites and cameras that it was given under the agreement.

During the U.S. presidential campaign, Joe Biden signaled willingness to rejoin the deal, but so far, his administration and the Iranians have been unable to agree on how the U.S. would reenter the agreement. Unless a political agreement can be brokered to at least provide some sanctions relief, key data may be lost by the end of May.

""Time is not on our side,"" says Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for fuel cycle strategies at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an arms control think tank.

The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and other nations was designed to drastically scale back Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. A key provision of the agreement was that Iran would provide access to international inspectors, so that they could keep meticulous tabs on everything the program was up to. IAEA inspectors fanned out across the entire nation, monitoring not just Iran's nuclear facilities, but its R&D and even the mines where it extracts natural uranium. The agreement also allowed for the extensive use of technology, including security cameras and remote devices that allowed inspectors to tell precisely at what levels Iran was enriching uranium, even when they weren't in the building.

The result was reams of data then feed into reports about what exactly Iran is up to. The expanded access provided to the inspectors is a cornerstone of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ""If there isn't the strengthened monitoring and verification in Iran, there is no JCPOA,"" says Hinderstein.

Although China, Russia, the EU and several other nations remain in the deal with Iran, it has been under strain since the U.S. pulled out in 2018. President Donald Trump called the deal ""horrible,"" saying it did not go far enough to limit Iran's nuclear program and completely failed to address other bad behavior. His administration applied harsh sanctions against key Iranian economic sectors such as oil and banking, and effectively blocked other partners in the deal from providing relief on their own.

For a while Iran did nothing, but then it started to slowly ratchet up its nuclear infrastructure: It began to enrich more uranium, added more ""centrifuges"" — the machines that do the job — and ramped up its R&D. Each step the nation has taken thus far has been relatively easy to reverse, analysts say, should sanctions relief start to come through.

Then a top nuclear scientist was assassinated in November. In response, the nation's conservative parliament passed a law saying some inspections must cease until the promised sanctions relief arrives.

""That was basically Iran's parliament's way of trying to regain control of the entire process because they were getting fed up,"" Esfandiary says.

In late February, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi raced to Tehran to try to find a solution. Upon his return, he announced that the agency had reached an agreement ""after what was a very very intensive consultation, negotiation with our Iranian counterparts.""

The exact nature of the agreement between Iran and the IAEA, the Vienna-based atomic watchdog, remains confidential. But Hinderstein says the goal was to preserve data. Take, for example, those cameras that monitor warehouses and workshops: ""The information would be stored in the camera, or at the location, but nobody would look at those images,"" Hinderstein says.

Normally the IAEA would see this kind of information quickly. But now, if you think of Iran's nuclear program as a book, ""What this is is basically tearing out the pages, but putting them in a sealed envelope off to the side,"" she says.

The data will be held for up to three months. If by then, Iran has received some economic benefits, it would be restored but without a political agreement, it will be dumped.

And that would be a big problem says Ellie Geranmayeh, of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Because particularly to the European parties to the deal, all that data inspectors have collected on Iran's program have been extremely valuable.

""I think that the inspection verification aspect of the deal has been the main reason why, for example, European countries in this agreement have stuck by the deal,"" she says. ""The fact that you had Grossi taking that trip to Tehran in the middle of a pandemic should be an indicator of how serious the issue was for them to resolve.""

Based on the data collected from the IAEA thus far, it appears that today Iran is far closer to having a nuclear weapons capability, should it choose to pursue one, than it was before the Trump administration left the deal.

Inspectors have also seen no evidence so far that Iran is actively trying to get a nuke. But if the U.S. and Iran can't revive the deal, and the cameras are shut off for good, Hinderstein says, it will become much harder to tell what Iran is really up to."

Separately, in a telephone call on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday asked Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for ""clear gestures"" and an immediate return to the terms of a landmark nuclear deal with Western powers.

Macron's office said the French leader also asked Rouhani to fully cooperate with the IAEA on inspections and expressed his ""deepest concern"" over Iranian violations of the accord.

Iran said last month it was scaling back cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, ending extra inspection and monitoring measures introduced by the 2015 nuclear deal, including the power given to the IAEA to carry out snap inspections at facilities not declared by Iran.

Britain, France and Germany, all parties to the deal with Iran, on Monday circulated a draft resolution backed by the United States for the Vienna meeting voicing ""serious concern"" at Iran's reduced cooperation and urging Iran to reverse its steps.

Russia and Iran have warned of serious consequences if the resolution passes.

""I have to give this warning, that actions against our expectations will have adverse effects on diplomatic processes, and can quickly close the windows of opportunity,"" Iran's government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters.

Iran expects ""all parties to act rationally and prudently, and to know the value of fleeting moments,"" he added. ""We are still committed to diplomacy.""

A document circulated by the Iranian mission in Vienna and seen by AFP said a resolution would effectively end a temporary agreement to mitigate the impact of the suspended inspections.

Restrictions on inspections went into force on February 23.

These followed a law passed by the Iranian parliament in December that called for suspending certain commitments if the US does not lift unilateral sanctions or the three European countries do not help Tehran to bypass those sanctions.

Under the agreement with the IAEA, that runs for up to three months, data from cameras on Iran's nuclear programme will be stored and not handed over to the agency, and if sanctions are not lifted by that time, Tehran will start erasing the recordings.

According to Rabiei, the agreement conveyed Iran's ""goodwill"", and now the Islamic republic expects other parties to the nuclear deal to ""prove"" theirs.

Diplomatic sources in Vienna say the European resolution is expected to face a vote on Friday, and that it is backed by the United States.

>> American air strikes in Syria: Joe Biden's firm but cautious message to Iran

The 2015 landmark nuclear deal has been hanging by a thread since former US president Donald Trump withdrew Washington from it and reimposed punishing sanctions on Iran in 2018.

Current US President Joe Biden has signalled his readiness to revive the deal, but insists Iran first return to all its nuclear commitments, most of which it suspended in response to the sanctions.

Tehran demands Washington take the first step by scrapping the sanctions.

Iran on Sunday dismissed a European offer for an informal meeting involving the US on the deal, saying the time is not right as Washington has failed to lift sanctions.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the plant would launch Turkey into the ”league of nuclear energy countries” and called it a “symbol of Turkish-Russian cooperation.”

Russia, which is expanding its nuclear construction services worldwide, is building Turkey’s first nuclear power plant on the Mediterranean coast in Mersin province. The two countries signed a cooperation agreement in 2010 and began construction in 2018.

Earlier this year, GE announced it was delivering the initial steam turbine module for the Akkuyu project.

Turkey – whose electricity production is based on gas-burning plants and hydroelectric units – is largely dependent on power imports, buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, among others.

Nuclear power is a “strategic step” for energy security, Erdogan said.

See PE’s coverage of the nuclear power industry both in the U.S. and globally

Last summer, Turkey announced that it had discovered 405 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Black Sea, and is prospecting for hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Mediterranean amid tensions with Greece and Cyprus over maritime rights.

Energy Minister Fatih Donmez, said the Akkuyu plant would fulfill about 10% of domestic electricity needs. Erdogan said the share of locally produced and renewable energy resources has reached 63.7% in established power networks.

Erdogan said the first reactor would become operational in 2023, to coincide with the centennial of the modern Turkish state. A total of four reactors are planned.

Russia’s Rosatom State Corporation holds a 99.2% stake in the project, whose total cost is estimated at 20 billion U.S. dollars, according to the plant’s website.

The Turkish president also said cooperation between Ankara and Moscow played a “key role” in regional stability.

“We have had the opportunity to see the results of Turkish-Russian dialogue in many fields, including in Libya, in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Syria,” Erdogan said. The two countries back opposing sides in these conflicts.

Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the event via video-conference Wednesday.

Speaking from Moscow, Putin called the nuclear plant a “truly flagship project.”

Turkey’s projects for nuclear power in the earthquake-prone region have triggered concern from neighboring Greece and Cyprus – where both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot environmental groups have voiced strong opposition.

Istanbul, Turkey – Turkish and Russian officials laid the foundation for the third reactor of Turkey’s first nuclear power plant Akkuyu in the southern coastal city of Mersin on Wednesday.

The plant’s first reactor unit is expected to be operational in 2023, the centenary of the Turkish Republic, and the remaining units in 2026.

The co-construction of the Akkuyu plant started in April 2018, eight years after the two countries signed an intergovernmental agreement.

The project is owned by the Russian energy company Rosatom while the Turkish Akkuyu is the license owner and the local operator.

Once completed, the plant is expected to produce 35 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually, about 10 percent of Turkey’s total electricity supply. The service life will last 50 years.

The facility will launch Turkey into the ”league of nuclear energy countries”, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, hailing it as a “symbol of Turkish-Russian cooperation”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who spoke at the event via video-conference from Moscow, called it a “truly flagship project”.

Akkuyu is the only nuclear power facility under construction in Turkey but a second project in the Black Sea province of Sinop is expected to kick off this year, reports suggest, if Ankara can find a new partner after Japan’s Mitsubishi pulled out last year.

The project was agreed on by the Japanese and Turkish governments in 2013. A consortium led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries conducted a feasibility study until March for the construction of a 4,500-megawatt plant in Sinop.

A senior energy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera the Turkish government is also considering a third nuclear plant with four reactors in the country’s northwest. Turkey’s ultimate goal is not building a nuclear weapon but diversity in energy resources, he said.

Russian dependency?

Since the Akkuyu project was signed, proponents of nuclear energy in Turkey have argued it would limit Turkey’s dependency on foreign energy suppliers. They also underline it is clean energy.

However, some international experts think differently.

Henry D Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, DC, said Akkuyu’s financing model could further Ankara’s dependency on Russia, a major energy provider to Turkey. The project is fully financed by Moscow.

Sokolski said it is an intensive capital investment and questioned why Turkey frontloads such debt while alternative and cheaper energy resources are coming down the pipeline.





Could Akkutu be a target?

Turkey is not the only country seeking nuclear energy in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and Jordan are still considering establishing nuclear power plants. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are in on it, while Israel is long believed to have a stockpile of nuclear weapons and Iran has the capacity to develop them.

Sokolski warned Turkey about the regional challenges of entering the fray. “Your neighbourhood is dangerous. People are fighting. Nuclear reactors in a shooting war can be targets.”

He said missiles and drones could knock out critical electrical supply lines to a reactor and destroy emergency generators, nuclear control rooms, reactor containment buildings, and spent reactor fuel buildings.

“These kinds of strikes can make people more anxious and result in radiological releases, like Chernobyl or worse,” said Sokolski.

Turkey has waged a war against the PKK, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party listed as a “terrorist” organisation by the United States, the European Union, and Turkey, for decades in a conflict that has killed an estimated 40,000 people.

News reports have suggested the armed group has camps in northern Iraq where armed drones are being developed.

Turkey is also embroiled in conflicts in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean, while the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen have targetted Saudi and Emirati targets with its missiles and drones. Armed groups such as the Syrian National Defence Forces, which is supportive of President Bashar al-Assad’s government, could mimic such attacks, said Sokolski.

Is it feasible?

The $20bn Akkuyu nuclear power plant has also raised other concerns. Its location has been controversial since the deal was signed with Russia as it is in an earthquake-prone area, while some critics highlight environmental concerns.

But some analysts support the project.

“You can never round off nuclear accident risks,” said Sinan Ulgen, director of the Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies. “What is important is to look at successful examples and what is being built in Turkey is a new-generation, high-technology compound.”





Ulgen said Akkuyu was designed based on risk analyses and believes improvised drones cannot harm such a facility.

However, he expressed concern about the governance of the project. Rosatom is a state-owned company and if any problem occurs in nuclear regulation, it has the potential to become a serious bilateral issue.

The senior Turkish energy official said when Ankara decided to build the nuclear facility, a fully Russia-financed model was the only feasible option.

Atomic weapon suspicions

Despite Turkey’s claims the plant will only be used to diversify energy resources, some have suggested Ankara may have plans to enrich uranium.

Turkey and nuclear-armed Pakistan have long had military cooperation agreements that were recently intensified, with some news reports suggesting Islamabad may be covertly supporting a nuclear weapons programme.

Military cooperation deals have been signed earlier this year with Kazakhstan, a country providing at least 35 percent of the world’s uranium.

Asked about possible nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, the senior energy official in Ankara said during meetings in Vienna there have been talks about possible cooperation on peaceful use, under IAEA control, especially in radiation technologies and cancer treatment.

Turkey is a party to all international nonproliferation instruments and export control regimes, including the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).

Turkey is also among the signatories of the binding International Code of Conduct against the proliferation of ballistic missiles and other anti-weapons pledges."

Rosatom announced today that first concrete has been poured for the third unit of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant under construction in the Mersin province of Turkey. The Russian and Turkish heads of state joined the ceremony held to mark the event by video link. The Akkuyu nuclear power plant project is based on an intergovernmental agreement the two countries signed in 2010.

""Three years ago we poured first concrete at Akkuyu NPP unit 1 and today we did it at unit 3,"" the Russian state nuclear corporation said on Twitter, adding that the construction licence for unit 4 is expected to be granted by the Turkish regulator later this year. ""Four VVER-1200 NPPs will secure 10% of Turkey's power needs. This success is proof that nuclear can and should be deployed efficiently around the world,"" Rosatom said.

According to a statement from the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin said: ""First of all, I congratulate all of you on the beginning of a new important stage in the implementation of a large-scale joint Russian-Turkish project - the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey. In a few minutes, President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan and I will start pouring concrete into the base of the third nuclear power unit. In total, the Akkuyu site envisages the construction of four reactor units with a total capacity of 4800 megawatts, which will be able to produce up to 37 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.""

The two leaders had also taken part in the ceremony to mark the start of the construction of the first power unit, in April 2018, he noted. Construction of unit 2 began in April 2020.

""The consistent implementation of the Akkuyu project has not been prevented even by the known difficulties associated with the coronavirus pandemic,"" Putin said. ""I would like to note that at the highest level, health and epidemic safety is ensured, and the health of the employees directly employed in the project is protected. We are convinced that [the plant's] implementation will make a serious contribution to strengthening the energy security of the Republic of Turkey and help stimulate further growth of its economy. It will provide Turkish consumers with affordable and environmentally friendly electricity.""

The development of a ""fundamentally new industry"" in Turkey, nuclear power, is strengthening the scientific and economic potential of the country, he said, adding that the number of personnel at the Akkuyu site now exceeds 8000 people, and that most of them are Turkish citizens.

Turkey's first Akkuyu nuclear power unit is due to start operations in 2023, which is the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.

According to a statement from the Turkish President's office, Erdoğan said that ""investment in energy is an investment in the future"".

He noted that, despite the pandemic, Turkey's economy ""continues to grow steadily"", reaching a growth rate of 1.8% in 2020, while 4900 MWe of new power plant capacity ""almost entirely from renewables"" was installed.

""Our discovery of 405 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Black Sea was one of the most important steps in our determination of 'Independent Energy, Strong Turkey'. We hope to receive good news from our drilling and seismic exploration efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean,"" he said.

Emphasising that nuclear energy ""has a special place"" in Turkey's energy policy, he said the goal is ""to add nuclear energy, which runs on zero emissions while generating energy and does no harm to the environment, to Turkey's energy basket"".

""As our economy grows, our need for reliable, uninterrupted and affordable energy grows as well. We have been working to diversify our energy projects with the understanding that investing in energy means investing in the future. In this regard, we attach great importance to energy efficiency and renewable energy,"" he said.

The first Akkuyu unit will be operational in 2023, he noted, further stressing that ""no efforts are being spared in order for the other three reactors of this plant to be operational one after another"", according to the statement.

Referring to the graduation of Turkish students from Russian university programmes, he said: ""As a matter of fact, 186 of our students selected to be trained within the scope of the project returned to our country after completing their 6.5 years of challenging studies. These young people will take part in all the processes of our nuclear power plant, from engineering to management. Thus, Turkey's nuclear energy think tank will be formed and our national energy mobilisation will gain new generations.""

The Akkuyu plant is equipped with the most advanced safety systems in compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency standards, he said.

After Erdoğan's speech, he and Putin instructed Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Dönmez and Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachov to launch the start of construction on unit 3.

As a permanent member of the UN security council, China was also duty-bound to fully enforce sanctions imposed on North Korea in response to its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, Blinken said.
There could be no contact nor dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang “unless the US rolls back its hostile policy towards [North Korea]”, Choe added.","china, missile, washington, regime, weapons, south, korea, state, sanctions, nuclear, north, blinken, minister, persuade",nuclear,Man-Made Disaster,"China must use its “tremendous influence” to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said, hours after the regime said it would ignore requests by a “hostile” US to resume negotiations.

Blinken said China had a “critical role” to play in influencing North Korea given its status as the impoverished state’s main trading partner and diplomatic ally.

Blinken and the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, are to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and the state councillor, Wang Yi, in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday – the first face-to-face talks between senior officials from the two countries since Joe Biden took office.

“Beijing has an interest, a clear self-interest in helping to pursue denuclearisation of [North Korea] because it is a source of instability. It is a source of danger and obviously a threat to us and our partners,” Blinken told reporters in Seoul after he and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, had met their South Korean counterparts.

As a permanent member of the UN security council, China was also duty-bound to fully enforce sanctions imposed on North Korea in response to its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, Blinken said.

Biden inherited a diplomatic stalemate from Donald Trump, who failed to make progress on denuclearisation after three meetings with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.

North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, confirmed on Thursday that Washington had been reaching out to the regime since mid-February, but that it had not responded.

Choe described the US approach as a “time-delaying trick”, adding that North Korea would continue to ignore offers of talks unless Washington dropped its “hostile” stance.

“What has been heard from the US since the emergence of the new regime is only a lunatic theory of threat from North Korea and groundless rhetoric about complete denuclearisation,” she said in a statement carried by the state KCNA news agency.

There could be no contact nor dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang “unless the US rolls back its hostile policy towards [North Korea]”, Choe added. “Therefore, we will disregard such attempts by the US in the future, too.”

Trump’s attempts to win concessions from Kim failed after the two disagreed over sanctions relief and what North Korea would be willing to give up in return.

Experts are debating whether the US and its allies should adjust their expectations and instead settle for a deal under which North Korea would freeze its nuclear activities in return for relaxing sanctions.

Choe said reports that the US was considering additional sanctions to raise pressure on tPyongyang, as well as its ongoing joint military drills with South Korea, were proof of its hostility.

Earlier this week, a senior US military official said he believed North Korea could be preparing to flight test an upgraded intercontinental ballistic missile, though experts played down the prospect of what would present a major challenge for the Biden administration.

Kim’s influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, warned the US to “refrain from causing a stink”, while criticising the US-South Korea drills, which Pyongyang has always viewed as a rehearsal for an invasion.

Blinken, Austin and their South Korean counterparts, the foreign minister, Chung Eui-yong, and the defence minister, Suh Wook, said in a joint statement that North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes were a “priority for the alliance”.

Austin said Washington remained committed to the defence of South Korea, using “the full range of US capabilities, including our extended deterrent”."
52,2021-03-18 00:00:00,Rejoining the Iran Nuclear Deal Is Not Enough,https://jewishcurrents.org/rejoining-the-iran-nuclear-deal-is-not-enough,"By rejoining the nuclear deal, the Biden administration may avert war with Iran.
But before the Islamic Revolution, when the Shah was a US ally, American presidents helped him develop Iran’s nuclear program.
What had shifted was not so much Iran’s nuclear aspirations—which exhibited significant continuity despite the change in regimes—as America’s attitude toward them.
It pushed through the Iranian nuclear deal over opposition from Republicans, and despite resistance from the governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia.
To check Iran’s nuclear program, Obama handed a virtual blank check to its regional foes, thus escalating conflicts that have left entire countries in ruin.","war, arabia, irans, middle, rejoining, saudi, iran, deal, iranian, uae, tehran, nuclear",nuclear,Man-Made Disaster,"WHEN JOE BIDEN and his top advisors describe their approach to relations with Iran, they usually emphasize two goals. First, they want to reenter the 2015 nuclear deal. Second, they want to resist Iranian influence in the Middle East, which they consider singularly malevolent. Biden, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have all characterized Iran’s foreign policy as “destabilizing.” Biden has also called Tehran’s behavior “aggressive,” while Blinken has added the epithet “egregious.”

In Washington, the first goal attracts the most attention because it’s the most controversial. Virtually all the Republicans in Congress, and some of the Democrats, believe the nuclear deal was a mistake, and oppose reviving it. The second goal, obstructing Iranian regional influence, occasions less discussion because the presumption underlying it—that Iran is a uniquely bad actor in its neighborhood—is widely considered self-evident.

But this rarely questioned assumption has enormous consequences for US policy in the Middle East. The Obama and Trump administrations used the specter of Iranian aggression to justify their support for the immensely destructive war that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have waged in Yemen. And although the Biden administration has ended support for “offensive operations” in that war and is reviewing arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the charge of Iranian malevolence will likely justify their continuation in some form, just as it helps to justify US military aid to Israel. The claim that Iran is especially destabilizing also rationalizes many of America’s non-nuclear sanctions on the country, most of which will remain even if the Biden administration rejoins the nuclear deal, and which ensure that the US does not establish normal diplomatic relations with Tehran.

These US policies, which make the Middle East more violent and less stable, are built on a false premise. Whether one examines Iran’s defense spending, its support for “terrorism,” or its military intervention in other countries, the country’s foreign policy is no more aggressive than those of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Turkey, or Israel, its chief regional competitors. In the Middle East, Iran is one brutal, self-interested, middle power among others. What distinguishes it from its adversaries is not its malevolence, but its independence from the United States.

Recognizing that Iran is no more destabilizing than its foes is not “whataboutism.” It is the precondition for a more effective and humane US policy in the region. Blinken has vowed that, in addition to resuscitating the nuclear deal, the Biden administration will seek a new agreement to restrain Iran’s missile program and end “its destabilizing actions in country after country.” Yet Iran is unlikely to limit its missile program while the US keeps arming its rivals. Curbing Iranian intervention in Syria and Yemen will require acknowledging that Tehran has security concerns that can only be assuaged if the US encourages its adversaries to change their behavior as well. By rejoining the nuclear deal, the Biden administration may avert war with Iran. But unless it challenges the bipartisan assumption that Iran behaves fundamentally differently than its neighbors, it has little chance of helping to broker regional peace.





WERE TEHRAN UNIQUELY MENACING it would, presumably, possess a uniquely menacing military arsenal. It does not. According to the World Bank, Iran spends just under $13 billion per year on defense. Israel, Turkey, and the UAE each spend over $20 billion. Saudi Arabia spends over $60 billion. Critics might respond that Iran’s relatively meager military budget reflects not a lack of desire for military dominance, but a lack of capacity, since sanctions have starved its government of revenue. But even as a share of GDP, Iran’s military spending is lower than Turkey’s, less than half of Israel’s or the UAE’s, and less than one-third of Saudi Arabia’s. In fact, Iran’s defense budget has been roughly flat as a share of GDP for the last 30 years, a trend preceding the crushing financial and oil sanctions imposed on Tehran by the US and its allies a decade ago.

Today, Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs provoke particular alarm in Washington. But before the Islamic Revolution, when the Shah was a US ally, American presidents helped him develop Iran’s nuclear program. With their assistance, notes Ariane M. Tabatabai in her book, No Conquest, No Defeat, the Shah developed a policy of nuclear “hedging,” in which “he would establish nuclear infrastructure for civilian use”—for instance, as a source of electricity—“which he could later leverage to build a nuclear weapon if his country needed one.”

After the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran transformed from an American partner into an American adversary. And it was this shift in geopolitical orientation that reshaped US attitudes toward the country’s nuclear program. Following the trauma of the Iran–Iraq War, in the 1980s, Iran began developing the capacity to build a bomb. It halted that effort in 2003, according to US intelligence. Instead, Iran’s government returned to hedging: Tehran maintained its dual-use technology, which gave it the capacity to revive its weapons program at a future date. What had shifted was not so much Iran’s nuclear aspirations—which exhibited significant continuity despite the change in regimes—as America’s attitude toward them.

But Iran is not the only power in the region with possible nuclear ambitions. As Mark Fitzpatrick, Associate Fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, explained to me, Saudi Arabia appears much further away from the capacity to build a bomb than Iran, but it has also proved more resistant to the intrusive international inspections that Iran accepted in 2015. That’s worrying because, as The New York Times reported last summer, US intelligence agencies have “raised alarms that there might be secret Saudi–Chinese efforts to process raw uranium into a form that could later be enriched into weapons fuel.” What’s alarming isn’t just the prospect that Riyadh may be developing the ingredients for a bomb, but the fact that, unlike in the case of Tehran, the outside world knows so little about its efforts.

Then there’s Israel, which most observers believe boasts not just a nuclear weapons program, but nuclear weapons—between 80 and 200 of them, Fitzpatrick estimates. (Israel neither confirms nor denies that it possesses nuclear weapons.) And while Saudi Arabia has not permitted the same intrusive inspections that Iran allows, Israel has not even signed the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which means it permits barely any international inspections at all. (Not only have American presidents declined to pressure Israel to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, US government employees are barred from even acknowledging it.)

Israel’s missile program is also more aggressive than Tehran’s. According to Fitzpatrick, the Jewish state’s longest-range ballistic missiles can travel 5,000 kilometers, more than twice as far as Iran’s. To be sure, Tehran’s missile program does clearly outmatch that of its other chief rivals. But viewing that disparity in isolation is misleading. Iran developed its missile arsenal when, as a result of US sanctions, it struggled during the Iran–Iraq War to procure spare parts for its largely American-made air force. To this day, its fleet remains antiquated compared to the modern air forces operated by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey. If Iran’s missiles destabilize the Middle East, then Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and Ankara’s warplanes do, too.





IN CASTING IRAN as uniquely aggressive, Washington policymakers cite not only its military arsenal but also its supposed status as the “world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism.” Evaluating that claim is challenging because defining terrorism is famously contentious. Across the world, governments often define it as political violence by organizations and regimes they oppose. In the US, for instance, Iran is routinely accused of terrorism for aiding militias that kill US troops in Iraq, even though the United Nations defines terrorism as violence against “civilians or non-combatants.” By contrast, the term is rarely applied to killings—which Iran alleges were carried out by Israel and the United States—of Iranian nuclear scientists, even when they are not members of the country’s military.

But even if you accept the US government’s definition of terrorism, it’s hard to sustain the claim that Iran is a more “egregious” purveyor of terror than its key rivals. Iran has certainly supported groups that attack civilians. To name a few examples: Argentinian prosecutors accused Tehran of aiding the perpetrators of a 1994 attack that killed 85 people at a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. In 2012, Iranian agents tried to assassinate Israeli diplomats in Thailand and Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, reportedly in retaliation for Israel’s attacks on Iranian scientists. A Belgian court recently convicted an Iranian diplomat of plotting an attack on Iranian opposition activists in Europe.

Yet as ugly as this behavior is, it pales in comparison to the terrorism perpetrated by Sunni extremists, many financed in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, as the US government’s own reports suggest. As The New Republic’s Jefferson Morley noted in 2019, “For the past twenty years or so, the annual reports of the National Counterterrorism Center have attributed the vast majority of the Islamic terrorist attacks around the world since 2001 to ‘Sunni extremists’. . . often funded by wealthy Persian Gulf Arabs.” The degree to which regimes like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are complicit in the actions of their citizens remains murky. But a section of the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks—which was declassified in 2016—declares that “while in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government.” In 2014, Joe Biden himself accused the Saudis, Emiratis, and Turks of having “poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of tons of weapons into . . . the extremist elements of jihadis” in Syria. Two years ago, CNN reported that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had given US-made weapons to al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. In its support for “terrorism,” Iran is one bad actor in a region full of them.





THE THIRD ELEMENT of Iran’s supposedly unique belligerence is its intervention in neighboring countries—what Biden has called “destabilizing activities, which threaten our friends and partners in the region.” But here, too, what really bothers America’s leaders is less Iran’s aggression than its independence.

When the Shah meddled in his neighbors’ affairs to keep leftists at bay during the Cold War, American presidents did not condemn Iran’s behavior as destabilizing. They welcomed it. In her history of Iranian national security strategy, Tabatabai notes that, in the late 1950s, the Shah sent arms to Lebanese president Camille Chamoun when he was threatened by allies of Egypt’s Arab nationalist leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the ’60s, Tehran provided weapons and training to Yemen’s monarch, who faced his own Nasserite challenge. In the ’70s, it sent thousands of Iranian troops to buttress a conservative king harried by leftist rebels in Oman. “As Iran’s regional policies became more assertive,” Tabatabi writes, “they more resembled those later pursued by the Islamic Republic.”

Seen in this historical perspective, Iran’s current interventions look less like a revolutionary bid to dominate the Middle East and more like a continuation of the jockeying for influence that Tehran has engaged in since the middle of the last century. Take Iran’s current involvement in Syria. Since the Islamic Revolution, the Assad family has been Iran’s primary regional ally: When virtually the entire Arab world backed Saddam’s invasion of Iran in 1980, only Syria took Iran’s side. So when Syrians rose up against their government during the Arab Spring, Iran’s leaders came to Bashar Assad’s aid rather than allow their longtime ally to be replaced by a pro-American government or one with ties to extremist Sunnis—either of which might have left Tehran isolated. That intervention—conducted in conjunction with Iran’s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah—wasn’t exactly “destabilizing,” since it buttressed a government already in power, but it was ghastly. Iran enlisted Shia Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan to fight in Syria; some were as young as 14, according to Human Rights Watch, which makes their recruitment a war crime. In helping Assad retake control over much of his country, Iran—along with Russia—abetted some of the worst horrors of the 21st century.

But in assessing whether Iran is uniquely aggressive, it’s worth noting that Iran’s regional adversaries have also meddled violently in Syria. While Tehran has sent troops to bolster Assad, Turkey has sent troops to weaken the Kurdish rebels who fought against him. Israel last year launched at least 39 airstrikes into Syria, killing over 200 people in its effort to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from building up arsenals there. The Saudis and Turks have funded Syrian rebel groups with ties to al Qaeda.

Outside of Syria, too, Iran is one bellicose actor among many. In 2011, the same year Tehran sent its troops to prop up a vicious regime run by a minority religious clique in Syria, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi did the same in Bahrain. In Lebanon, Iran wields power by backing Hezbollah, which murders political opponents. For its part, Riyadh was accused by Lebanon’s president of holding that country’s prime minister “hostage” in 2017. In Israel-Palestine, Iran supports Hamas, which from its base in the Gaza Strip has launched rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. But Turkey backs Hamas as well. Meanwhile, Israel—with assistance from Egypt—blockades Gaza, making life “unlivable” for millions of people, according to the United Nations.

To buttress their claims that Iran’s actions are uniquely destabilizing, critics often cite the country’s support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen. That support does indeed fuel violence. Although the Houthi insurgency predates its partnership with Iran, and the US government has acknowledged that the Houthis don’t take orders from Tehran, they do now receive millions of dollars in weaponry annually, in violation of a UN arms embargo. But if the Iranians have spent millions per year to support the Houthi rebellion, the Saudis have reportedly spent billions per month to stop it. According to Human Rights Watch, the Saudis and Emiratis have carried out more than 20,000 air strikes over the last five years, which have demolished “hospitals, school buses, markets, mosques, farms, bridges, factories, and detention centers.” Human Rights Watch has also accused both Saudi and UAE forces of torturing Yemeni detainees, and blamed the Saudi-led coalition for a blockade of the country that has helped to create what Oxfam calls “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.” (In 2019, the UAE pulled most of its forces out of Yemen.) Tehran’s behavior in Yemen has been reprehensible; Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s has been even worse.





SURVEY THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST and it becomes clear that Iranian intervention is in fact less extensive than the intervention practiced by its key competitors. The reason is straightforward. In Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, Iran participates in proxy battles that pit its Shia allies against Sunni adversaries. But there is another proxy war roiling the Middle East: between Sunni forces sympathetic to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and those that use the specter of Islamism to entrench authoritarian rule. In this second battle, from which Iran is largely absent, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey wage war against each other.

In Egypt, for example, the UAE and Saudi Arabia financed efforts to overthrow Mohammed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood president democratically elected in 2012, and then bankrolled the oppressive regime of General Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi after he seized power in a coup. Similar allegations of Islamism drove Saudi Arabia and the UAE to blockade neighboring Qatar in 2017. In Libya, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have used the supposed threat of Islamism to justify their support for the warlord Khalifa Haftar—in violation of a UN arms embargo—in his fight against a government recognized by the United Nations. During Haftar’s 2019 assault on Tripoli, which was armed and financed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported that his forces shelled “hospitals, residential neighborhoods and the capital’s only functioning airport,” and forced 200,000 people from their homes.

In Libya, as in Egypt, Tehran is not Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s primary regional rival. Their key adversary is Ankara, which supports the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey has dispatched drones, armored vehicles, and thousands of Syrian fighters, in an effort to bolster the government in Tripoli—which violates the UN arms embargo. Last year, Turkey also reportedly paid Syrian mercenaries to fight in Azerbaijan’s war against Armenia, thus placing it on the same side as Israel, which sold Baku many of the drones that helped it prevail. Iran, yet again, stood on the sidelines. Contra the Washington policymakers who claim that Iran’s foreign policy is uniquely aggressive, Tehran may actually be less aggressive than its regional foes—not because its government is more enlightened, but because, as a non-Arab, non-Sunni regime with a comparatively limited arms export industry, its sphere of influence is more circumscribed.





IN 2015, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION inched toward a more realistic policy toward Iran. It pushed through the Iranian nuclear deal over opposition from Republicans, and despite resistance from the governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia. But, in the process, it accepted a compromise, embracing its opponents’ vision of the Middle East as a region divided between benevolent moderates and malevolent Iran. In part as compensation for the nuclear agreement, it provided new arms sales to Saudi Arabia, an unprecedented military aid package to Israel, active US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and the maintenance of America’s non-nuclear sanctions on Iran. To check Iran’s nuclear program, Obama handed a virtual blank check to its regional foes, thus escalating conflicts that have left entire countries in ruin.

Now Joe Biden faces a similar choice. His advisors want to revive the nuclear deal and then craft a follow-on agreement that curbs Iran’s regional meddling. But any diplomatic effort premised on the notion that only Iran’s adversaries can legitimately wield influence beyond their borders will fail. To help negotiate peace in ravaged nations like Syria and Yemen, the Biden administration must negotiate with Iran. It must treat the country not as a pariah but as one of the several ruthless, interventionist regimes whose interests must be accommodated if the proxy wars that have devastated the Middle East are to end. It must stop pretending that America’s friends are any less aggressive than its foes.

The alternative is to embrace a version of Obama’s brutal bargain: Avert war with Iran, but continue to stoke a regional cold war—and share responsibility for the immense suffering that follows.

It’s not at all certain that Iran will accept the terms. Earlier this year, Tehran rejected a U.S. proposal it deemed unacceptable, then offered its own idea that Biden’s team declared a non-starter, two people familiar with the situation said.

Still, officials in both countries are aware that if no breakthrough takes place over the next few weeks, little is likely to happen until September at the earliest, and that’s if the deal can be saved at all. The warnings come as progressives pressure Biden to rejoin the deal and as some officials and analysts wonder if Biden is genuine about his stated desire to see the agreement revived.

“Iran is poised to blow through additional nuclear deal restrictions in the next few weeks. This is the crucial time to avoid an escalation of the situation,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an organization that has closely tracked nuclear negotiations involving Iran.

One reason for a sense of urgency among some U.S. officials as well as those outside American government is that Iran holds presidential elections in June, with campaign season kicking off in May. The politics surrounding the 2015 nuclear agreement are very sensitive in Iran, so the theocratic regime there is unlikely to allow any major moves on it amid a campaign.

Separately, an important temporary agreement that Iran reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency will expire in late May. That temporary agreement paused Iran’s effort to curtail the IAEA’s access to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Although the U.N. agency will still have access to Iran’s program, it will be less than world powers would like.

The American proposal slated to be set forth this week is, “more than anything, about trying to get the conversation started” between the United States and Iran, one of the people familiar with the situation said.

Asked for official comment, a senior Biden administration official declined to discuss details of diplomatic conversations: “We have been clear that we are ready to pursue a mutual return to the [Iran deal],” the official added. “We have also been open that we are talking with our [international] partners … about the best way to achieve this, including through a series of initial, mutual steps. We have been looking at options for doing so, including with indirect conversations through our European partners.”

In an email, Shahrokh Nazemi, the head of the press section at Iran’s mission to the United Nations, said the “return of the U.S. to the [deal] needs no specific proposal. It only requires a political decision by the U.S. to go for the full and immediate implementation of its obligations under” the agreement and a key U.N. resolution.

Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program was meant for peaceful purposes, not making a bomb.

The U.S. and Iran have been exchanging ideas for how to jump-start negotiations for several weeks, mainly by using intermediaries in Europe. There have not been direct U.S.-Iran discussions, people familiar with the situation said.

Earlier this year, the U.S. suggested that it would give Iran access to a small amount of its billions of dollars in frozen assets in exchange for Iran stopping its 20 percent enrichment of uranium, one of the people confirmed.

Tehran balked at what it saw as an unequal offer. In response, it suggested that it would halt uranium enrichment for a month in exchange for the U.S. lifting all its sanctions. The American side saw that as more of a cheeky rejoinder than a serious counter-proposal, the person said.

The 2015 agreement, which was negotiated by several countries, lifted an array of U.S. and international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for severe curbs on the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, reimposing U.S. sanctions as well as adding new ones. In response, Iran has taken several steps that have put it out of compliance.

Biden and his top aides have said the United States won’t lift its sanctions unless Iran returns to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. administration also has said it wants to build on the original agreement, crafting a “longer and stronger” deal that could cover topics outside of just Iran’s nuclear program.

“The ball is really in their court to see if they want to take the path to diplomacy and returning to compliance with the agreement,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said of the Iranians.

Iran, however, appears interested in simply restoring the original agreement, which would give it needed relief from sanctions that have damaged its economy. It argues that because the U.S. walked away first from a deal that was working, the U.S. should take the first step by removing the sanctions.

In a recent interview with POLITICO Magazine, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif downplayed the idea of follow-on negotiations, saying Tehran didn’t trust the U.S. after the Trump-era attempt to kill the original deal.

“If the U.S. passes the test of [the 2015 deal], which doesn’t seem very likely, then we can consider other issues,” Zarif added. “But I don’t think the U.S. would be prepared to discuss those issues. Is the U.S. ready to reduce its arms shipments to the region?”

People familiar with the situation say the true problem at the moment isn’t about the sequencing of who does what first. Rather, it’s about what exactly each side would have to do, or give up, at this stage if it is serious about bringing both countries back into compliance.

“What Tony Blinken or [National Security Adviser] Jake Sullivan need to say is what the U.S. is willing to do if Iran comes back into compliance,” said Kimball of the Arms Control Association. “That would provide an important public signal into where the Biden administration wants this to go. The public posturing of the Biden administration right now looks a lot like that of the Trump administration, and that has not been encouraging to the Iranian side.”

The next Iranian president could be drawn from Iran’s more conservative political ranks. That element of Iranian society is more averse to deal-making with the United States than those on the so-called reformist side of the spectrum. Outgoing Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose administration helped craft the deal, has been considered closer to the reformist camp.

Matters of state in Iran are ultimately decided by a cleric, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been in charge of the country for decades and is deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions.

The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Iran four decades ago as adherents of the Middle Eastern country’s Islamist revolution held dozens of Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The lack of diplomatic ties has long complicated any U.S.-Iranian talks, and the nuclear negotiations involved secret discussions brokered by the tiny country of Oman.

Still, even if the next Iranian president, with Khamenei’s blessing, is open to talks, he and his aides will need time to transition into office and catch up on the various files. Negotiations that follow could take months, getting closer to the time when elements of the original nuclear deal start to expire.

Biden administration officials are conscious of the calendar but determined not to let it push them into a weak position, people familiar with the situation said.

Biden faces pressure from both the left and the right on how to tackle Iran. Progressive organizations have planned events this week to publicly call for Biden to return to the nuclear deal. At the same time, Republicans and some moderate and hawkish Democrats have made statements and sent letters to Biden urging him to stay tough on Iran and hold out for a better deal.

Biden himself, meanwhile, appears in no rush to restore the original deal, people familiar with the situation said. The president is well-aware that the public is more concerned about the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, and other issues. Plus, having a Senate split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats also gives Biden less room to maneuver politically.

“He’s very comfortable with where we are,” one person familiar with the situation said. “Is he lying awake at night worrying about this? He’s probably got other things to worry him more.”

In a speech marking the Persian New Year earlier this month, Khamenei, the Iranian supreme leader, said his country, too, is in “no hurry” to return to compliance with the deal.

“It’s not a matter of who should be the first,” he said, according to various media accounts. “The issue is that we trusted the Americans and fulfilled our commitments in the nuclear deal, but they didn’t.”

Earlier this year, there were debates within Biden’s team over whether to simply restore the original nuclear deal or hold out for a bigger, more expansive one, with the option of an interim deal along the way. Those divisions seem to have receded as the administration seeks a formula that will simply bring Iran back to the table.

The 2015 nuclear agreement took several years to negotiate and it involved the United States, then led by President Barack Obama, as well as Iran, China, Russia, Britain, Germany, and France.

In walking away from the agreement, Trump argued that it had too many sunset clauses and that it should have covered aspects of Iran’s behavior beyond its nuclear program. Many of Trump’s critics said the real reason he left the deal was simply out of spite toward his predecessor, Obama.

European officials have since tried to salvage the agreement, but it’s been a challenge because their governments and private firms, too, could face U.S. sanctions if they did business with Iran.

European leaders tried to arrange an informal meeting between U.S. and Iranian representatives, which would likely have been held earlier this month. But Iranian officials rejected the idea, saying the “time isn’t ripe.”"

Anti-nuclear groups condemn UK's stockpile strategy

International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) executive director Beatrice Fihn slammed the UK for the decision to increase its nuclear capacity. Fihn said Britain ""is pushing for a dangerous new nuclear arms race,"" and charged that the plan ""violates international law.""

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) also condemned the UK's decision.

Meanwhile, Oliver Meier, from the University of Hamburg's Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy, joined the chorus of disapproval as he told DW that the UK is dramatically shifting its nuclear strategy while potentially putting it at odds with both NATO and the US.

""The United Kingdom has committed to — under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty — reducing the number and role of nuclear weapons,"" Meier said.

""There's also an obligation to work towards a goal of a nuclear weapons-free world that is hard to reconcile with this decision.""

The report also labels China a ""systemic competitor"" and says the UK must work more closely with Asian partners such as South Korea, India and Japan.

""There is no question that China will pose a great challenge to an open society such as ours, but we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests,"" Johnson told Parliament on Tuesday. The review said the UK must ""remain open to Chinese trade and investment.""

Johnson is slated to visit India in April. The UK has applied for partner status at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
