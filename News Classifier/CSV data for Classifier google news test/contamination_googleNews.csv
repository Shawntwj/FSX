Natick will find another lab to test its samples, Rooney said.
The lab Natick currently uses is certified by the state Department of Environmental Protection.
It has tested 20,000 Natick water samples through the years, including more than 1,500 annually.
Until a deal is reached with a new lab, a Massachusetts Water Resources Authority lab will test Natick’s water samples.","state, lab, contamination, testing, water, cause, town, likely, rooney, test, department, mistake, towns, natick, coli, samples",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"NATICK — The E. coli contamination found in samples of the town’s drinking water was likely caused by an inadvertent cross-contamination at the testing lab, said acting Town Administrator Robert Rooney.

Rooney gave that conclusion — provided by town staff and an independent engineer — Wednesday night to the Select Board.

Natick will find another lab to test its samples, Rooney said. The lab Natick currently uses is certified by the state Department of Environmental Protection. It has tested 20,000 Natick water samples through the years, including more than 1,500 annually.

Until a deal is reached with a new lab, a Massachusetts Water Resources Authority lab will test Natick’s water samples.

False positives can’t be ruled out. Rooney said he was told by the state that it gets four-to-six false positives of E. coli yearly in water samples.

An inspection of the water system by the town’s public works staff — and a drone — showed no breach, including the possibility that an animal or person could have tampered with the water supply, Rooney said.

The town Health Department has not reported any resident illnesses connected to the contamination.

The problem was detected Jan. 12 in nine of 12 sites in Natick’s water distribution system. Contaminated samples were also detected in the Elm Bank well, according to a spokesman with the state Department of Environmental Protection.

Residents were ordered to boil tap water for at least a minute before drinking it, a state DEP requirement. The order was lifted in three days after two rounds of samples indicated no contamination.

The recalled products include several varieties of butternut squash noodles, precut squash chunks, and vegetable medleys that were sold in retail locations in 12 states, according to a press release posted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. These products were recalled in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington, D.C.

Unfortunately for fall-vegetable fans, this isn't the only butternut squash recall out there right now. Pero Family Farms recalled a whole bunch of processed squash products earlier this month, including some sold at Publix stores, all for possible listeria contamination.

There haven't been any illnesses reported in relation to either the Lancaster Farms or the Pero Family Farms recalls. But because listeria can cause severe symptoms, it's important to be aware of the recalled products.

Listeria is a type of bacteria that, if ingested, can cause an infection called listeriosis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains. For most people, listeriosis is a mild infection with symptoms similar to those of other food-borne illnesses, such as diarrhea and a fever. But if the infection spreads beyond the gut (invasive listeriosis), it can cause more serious issues—especially for pregnant people.

People who are pregnant and have a listeria infection may experience only mild symptoms, but the infection can lead to miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, the CDC says. In those who aren't pregnant, invasive listeriosis may cause symptoms such as muscle aches, fever, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and headaches.

If you think you may have purchased any of the recalled products, you can return them to the store for a full refund. And if you think you might be experiencing symptoms of a listeria infection, check in with your doctor.

Pot contamination is a serious concern. Pathogenic microorganisms on cannabis can be harmful if inhaled, especially if taken as a medicinal product by a cancer patient receiving chemotherapy who may have a weakened immune system.

Last year, state regulators recalled marijuana products sold at dispensaries in Detroit and Kalamazoo after the products failed lab tests for mold and bacteria, and in Lansing because of chemical contamination.

The Michigan Information & Research Service reported that Ben Rosman, the founder of the Michigan Coalition of Independent Cannabis Testing Laboratories, said there is ""a ton of contaminated cannabis"" on the shelves.

He said his lab, PSI Labs in Ann Arbor, has tested and found tainted pot.

Rosman, when reached late Wednesday by the Free Press, said his lab has been testing cannabis since 2015. He said his lab has conducted studies for 8 to 12 months, and found traces of mold had not been detected by one of the state tests.

He said that the disallowed test resulted in false negatives, which means moldy pot passed the test.

Rosman said the group was successful in urging the state to disqualify the qPCR method, which was a positive step, and would like the industry and state to educate consumers about potential contamination dangers and sign a consent waiver.

He said he does not believe more stringent cannabis testing is necessary.

""You want safe, quality product on the shelves,"" he said.

The state Marijuana Regulatory Agency, however, had little to publicly say about the issue.

""There is no product recall at this time,"" the agency said in an email to the Free Press. ""As always, any consumer should report any adverse reaction to any marijuana product to the retail location and/or the MRA.""

The agency added in its email that the letter it sent last week disallowing the use of what is called a qPCR to test for mold was ""in response to the ongoing validation of test methods for total yeast and mold; it is not related to specific test results.""

A door knob at a hospital in Suzhou of East China's Jiangsu Province returned a positive result for COVID-19 when sampled for nucleic acid testing on Sunday, raising concerns over environment contamination by COVID-19 vaccines and infection risks among humans it might possibly cause.Experts noted that it should be investigated whether the positive result was caused by exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine when such a situation occurs, so that an infection by the actual virus won't be overlooked.However, the general public shouldn't panic if such situations occur because contamination of the environment by an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine solution cannot infect humans, experts said.The Suzhou hospital is one of the city's designated vaccination sites, according to a list released by the Suzhou government on January 10. The reason for the positive test result on the doorknob has not yet been determined.The positive result has led to the hospital being closed for track and tracing purposes, the local authority announced on Monday. The hospital staff all returned negative nucleic acid test results.Notably, recent nucleic acid tests taken on the environment at vaccination sites across some provinces and cities in China also revealed that samples collected from tables, walls, corridors and doorknobs of vaccination sites tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to an announcement on Sunday by China's national Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The aerosol produced during the vaccination process or inactivated vaccine solution residue may result in positive nucleic acid tests at vaccination sites due to the contamination of objects at the sites as well as personal goods of medical staff or the recipients coming into contact with contaminated environments, China CDC said.Experts told the Global Times that it is actually normal to detect positive results when performing environment testing at vaccination sites; as it is inevitable that, based on regular vaccination procedures, the vaccine solution may contaminate the surrounding environment when it is administered.""For example, when you draw out the vaccine liquid and vent the syringe, some vaccine liquid will drip out, causing contamination on objects or the environment,"" Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based medical expert on vaccines, told the Global Times, adding that a similar situation also occurs when other vaccines are administered as well.Experts stressed that it has to be investigated where the nucleic acid of the COVID-19 detected in the environment is really from, so that real infections aren't overlooked, as the country continues to fight COVID-19.""When a positive result is found, we need to conduct research and determine whether it is caused by a vaccine or a wild virus strain based on the comprehensive situation, so as to reduce difficulties or confusions in epidemic prevention,"" a Beijing-based immunologist, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times.Tao said that gene sequencing would help distinguish the virus from popular strains.However, the general public shouldn't worry about being infected by vaccine contamination, as the virus in the inactivated vaccine has lost its infectivity and pathogenicity, experts noted.""The inactivated vaccine will retain some RNA segments of the virus, but won't necessarily be a complete one, leading to a positive result in testing.

TOKYO (AP) — A draft investigation report into the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown, adopted by Japanese nuclear regulators Wednesday, says it has detected dangerously high levels of radioactive contamination at two of the three reactors, adding to concerns about decommissioning challenges.

The interim report said data collected by investigators showed that the sealing plugs sitting atop the No. 2 and 3 reactor containment vessels were as fatally contaminated as nuclear fuel debris that had melted and fell to the bottom of the reactors following the March 2011 tsunami and earthquake.

The experts said the bottom of the sealed plug, a triple-layered concrete disc-shaped lid 12 meters (39 feet) in diameter sitting atop the primary containment vessel, is coated with high levels of radioactive Cesium 137.

The No. 1 reactor lid was less contaminated, presumably because the plug was slightly knocked out of place and disfigured due to the impact of the hydrogen explosion, the report said.

The experts measured radiation levels at multiple locations inside the three reactor buildings, and examined how radioactive materials moved and safety equipment functioned during the accident. They also said venting attempt at Unit 2 to prevent reactor damage never worked, and that safety measures and equipment designs still need to be examined.

The lid contamination does not affect the environment as the containment vessels are enclosed inside the reactor buildings. The report did not give further details about if or how the lid contamination would affect the decommissioning progress.

Nuclear Regulation Commission Chairman Toyoshi Fuketa called the findings “extremely serious” and said they would make melted fuel removal “more difficult.” He said figuring out how to remove the lids would be a major challenge.

Removing an estimated 900 tons of melted fuel debris from three reactors is a daunting task expected to take decades, and officials have not been able to describe exactly when or how it may end.

The Fukushima plant was to start removing melted fuel debris from Unit 2, the first of three reactors, later this year ahead of the 10th anniversary of the accident. But in December, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the government announced a delay until 2022. They said the development of a robotic arm for the debris removal — a joint project with Britain — has been delayed due to the pandemic.

Full Coverage: Japan

Under the current plan, a remote-controlled robotic arm will be inserted from the side of the reactor to reach the molten fuel mixed with melted parts and concrete floor of the reactor. Eventually the lids also would have to be removed, but their contamination is a major setback.

The team of experts entered areas inside the three reactors that were previously highly contaminated and inaccessible after radiation levels came down significantly. They’re seeking data and evidence before they get lost in the cleanup.

Massive radiation from the reactors has caused some 160,000 people to evacuate from around the plant. Tens of thousands are still unable to return home.

Nitrates are toxic chemicals that contaminate much of the state’s groundwater, due to agricultural runoff.

A component of many fertilizers, nitrates are present almost anywhere and everywhere farming is practiced.

If you’re based in Wisconsin, you might want to inquire into the source of your drinking water. Much of the state’s water supply appears to be contaminated with nitrates, naturally occurring ions that can pose a risk to human health when consumed in concentrations that exceed—or, it turns out, even meet—federal standards. The October study that revealed the extent of the problem was published in the journal Environmental Monitoring and Assessment.

Nitrates are chemical compounds that are endemic to soil, water, certain foods, and bodily waste. In the springtime, they can also be found blanketing the fields of farms and ranches in the West and Midwest, where nitrate-containing substances such as nitrogen-based fertilizer and animal manure have been a staple of agricultural production since the postwar era.

But their prevalence, according to the new study, comes at a cost to the surrounding communities.

What This Means For You High levels of nitrate in drinking water can have detrimental health effects. If you suspect your drinking water may be contaminated and it comes from a private well, you may contact your state certification officer for a list of laboratories in your area that will perform tests on drinking water for a fee, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Financial Toll

Conducted by researchers affiliated with the organizations Clean Wisconsin and the Environmental Working Group, the study aimed to put a number on the healthcare costs incurred by nitrate exposure in Wisconsin between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, by quantifying associated disease diagnoses and adverse birth outcomes.

By reviewing data compiled by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, the researchers determined that between 111 and 298 cancers, 137 and 149 low fetal birth weights, 72 and 79 premature births, and up to two neural tube birth defects could be attributed to ingesting water contaminated with nitrates each year.

Several recent studies have also found increased health risks from ""nitrate levels below the federal drinking water standard” of 10 parts per million, lead study author Paul Mathewson, PhD, staff scientist at Clean Wisconsin and associate scientist in the department of integrative biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of Letters and Science, tells Verywell. The standard's evident inadequacy, he says, can be explained by the fact that it was ""established to protect against methemoglobinemia rather than carcinogenic or birth effects."" Methemoglobinemia is a condition caused by impaired oxygen transportation that is known as “blue baby syndrome” in infants.

Mathewson and his co-authors estimated that nitrate exposure-associated cancers and adverse birth outcomes run Wisconsinites up a minimum of $23 million and a maximum of $80 million annually. If nothing is done, that figure will likely only increase with time, but if local, state, or federal authorities manage to reduce nitrate concentrations in drinking water by 40%, it could be slashed by more than one-fifth.

However, the estimate did not factor in the indirect costs of diagnosis and treatment, which can be significant. Premature babies, for example, are more likely to have health problems and less likely to attain academic and financial success than their peers, “even after additional confounders and socioeconomic factors are considered,” Mathewson and his co-authors wrote.

Why Wisconsin?

While nitrate contamination is not exclusive to Wisconsin, the Midwestern state is particularly hard-hit because two-thirds of its residents source their drinking water from groundwater stores, often via private wells. Most of these wells, Chloe Wardropper, PhD, assistant professor in the department of natural resources and society at the University of Idaho's College of Natural Resources, tells Verywell, serve fewer than 25 people and are accordingly exempt from federal oversight under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

That means that users “could be unknowingly ingesting high concentrations of nitrates since they are colorless and odorless,” Mathewson says.

When nitrogen-based fertilizer or animal manure is distributed to promote plant growth, according to Wardropper, the excess inevitably bleeds into the earth and contaminates the groundwater. Once ingested, the nitrates combine with amines and amides already present in the body to form what the National Cancer Institute describes as carcinogenic, or cancer-causing, “N-nitroso compounds” (NOCs).﻿﻿﻿﻿ The NOCs eventually pass into the small intestine and other tissues, impairing the function of these organs along the way.

“High levels of nitrates in a human body can cause respiratory problems, particularly in babies with ‘blue baby syndrome,' reproductive complications for women, and have been connected to several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and kidney cancer,” Wardropper says.

The prevalence as well as the severity of these side effects in affected populations, Mathewson and his co-authors wrote, means that nitrate contamination should be considered a public health threat—not only in Wisconsin but everywhere nitrogen-based fertilizer is in widespread use.﻿﻿﻿﻿

That includes every other U.S. state as well as foreign nations with industrial economies. In many European rivers, nitrate concentrations are 10 to 15 times higher than they were a century ago. In parts of the Baltic Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Thailand, and the Gulf of Mexico, nitrate overload has indirectly created marine “dead zones”—regions of the ocean so devoid of oxygen they can no longer support aquatic life—that can span thousands of square miles.﻿﻿﻿﻿

A Way Forward

Both Mathewson and Wardropper say that one way to reduce the nitrate burden would be by taking steps to combat fertilizer and manure overapplication and sewage leaks.

“It is well understood that manure and fertilizers are commonly over-applied to many fields, so working to address this overapplication and encouraging farming practices that reduce runoff would go a long way towards addressing this contamination,"" Mathewson says. ""Septic systems are also a source of nitrates to the environment, so ensuring septic codes are up to date and folks are in compliance would help.""

One Wisconsin county, Dane County, has already set an example for others by developing what Wardropper, who attended graduate school there, describes as an ""innovative"" program that ensures safe and effective waste management. Home to many dairy farms, Dane has ""invested in community manure storage facilities to take some of that excess manure, as well as biodigesters, which turn manure into energy,” Wardropper says.

But as with most solutions, money is an object. Both she and Mathewson seem to believe that an increase in federal funding for initiatives developed to monitor or improve water safety would streamline the process of curbing nitrate contamination significantly."

Marquita Price grew up spending lots of time at her grandmother's one-story lavender house in Deep East Oakland. It's a place she's always considered home, and where her grandmother still lives. So Price, an urban planner, was upset to learn about a lesser-known aspect of climate change fueled by sea level rise: it could cause the groundwater beneath this formerly-industrial community to rise, and wreak slow-motion havoc in the process.

""How is that going to affect my family?"" Price thought. ""And my community and the assets that we worked so hard to hold?""

For many Bay Area residents who live near the water's edge, little-publicized research indicates groundwater rising beneath their feet could start to manifest in 10-15 years, particularly in low-lying communities like Oakland. And that could resurface toxic substances that have lingered for years underground.

""Everything human beings use, they spill,"" says Kristina Hill, an associate professor at UC Berkeley's College of Environmental Design, who researches adapting urban areas and shoreline communities to climate change. The overflow includes ""everything we've used in the last hundred and fifty years.""

That's a lot of things in the Bay Area, which is rife with industrial sites new and old. In East Oakland, industry boomed in the early 1900s as lumber yards, canneries, rail depots and foundries sprung up. It was a long time before governments enacted major environmental regulations, starting in the 1960s. ""Through the entire postwar and World War II-era, stuff got dumped informally,"" Hill says.

More recent contaminants lie buried as well, chemicals like benzene and toluene, leaked from underground storage tanks. Many toxic sites now considered to be contained could pose a threat as the water ascends.

""Legacy contamination in the soil will be remobilized when the water table comes up and intersects with these areas of contaminated soil,"" Hill says. If the groundwater flows into contaminants no longer monitored because they are considered contained, those toxic substances may start to move unnoticed.

That contaminated groundwater could seep into a basement or crawlspace beneath a home, or sneak in through a broken sewage line. Some of these chemicals vaporize, so humans could breathe them in.

A recent report by Silvestrum Climate Associates, a private environmental consulting firm, found this could affect communities with a mile of the Bay Area coast. Hill and her colleagues have analyzed data and found the water below someone's backyard is typically within 6 feet of the surface of the ground, and often just 1-2 feet below the surface.

""It's possible that you have contamination in that water and you might not see it or smell it. You might not know,"" says Alec Naugle, who heads the toxics cleanup division for the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The agency regulates the mitigation of contaminated sites in a large area stretching over the nine Bay Area counties.

""If you're exposed to these chemicals over a lifetime, they can increase your risk of cancer,"" Naugle says. ""Some of those chemicals also have short-term risks at much higher concentrations that we don't typically see in the environment.""

Many neighborhoods most at risk have large Black and Latino populations who already deal with unequal environmental health burdens due to living near major freeways and, in Oakland, a sizeable port. Residents of East and West Oakland have high rates of asthma, and children in East Oakland are more than twice as likely to suffer from the condition than their peers across Alameda County.

Hill says it's no coincidence that large numbers of people of color live in low-lying areas that will likely face the threat of rising groundwater first. ""There was either redlining or restrictive homeowner covenants that prevented people of color from moving to neighborhoods on higher ground,"" she says.

Regulators assess next moves

Naugle, from the Water Quality Control Board, says contaminated sites are at risk of flooding all along California shorelines. ""There are literally hundreds, perhaps thousands of these cases in our region alone, not to mention statewide,"" he says.

He and his team now face the daunting task of what to do, and where to do it first. Over the next few years, Silvestrum Climate Associates will map groundwater depths and test for contamination in four Bay Area counties. Naugle and his water board colleagues plan to use that data to identify the most urgent locations.

California's Department of Toxic Substances Control plans to tackle the problem as well. Grant Cope, deputy director for site mitigation and restoration, would like to work with the U.S. Geological Survey to overlay maps that show groundwater rise onto maps of contaminated sites. That could serve as ""an early-warning system"" for site managers.

In the meantime, Hill of UC Berkeley suggests residents request a monitoring well to track groundwater levels at nearby locations of concern, especially if they live downhill from former industrial sites like dry cleaners, gas stations or factories. Californians can also review sites known to contain contaminants through GeoTracker, an online database where various regulators track cleanup efforts.

Cope says people can also lobby local governments to ""pass enforceable standards that apply to groundwater rise due to sea level rise."" He says that means groundwater rise must be taken into account when new buildings are planned, or when toxic sites are cleaned up.

Urban planner Marquita Price wants to make people in her East Oakland community aware of this looming threat. A low-lying affordable housing development, Coliseum Gardens, sits on the location of a former recycling center, ringed by old industrial sites. She says residents notice flooding, but not many realize ""exactly what it is, and how contaminated it is, and how damaging it really could be.""

Price also wants her community to have a role in addressing the problem.

""I don't want just some outside consultants and companies to come in and carry out the plan,"" she says. ""Our unemployment is crazy out here. So this could definitely be a low-entry job that can provide to the community."""

Lead-contaminated water quickly filled the city’s pipes, leaving Flint residents amidst a disaster. After nearly six years, Flint has yet to recover but is pushing forward after receiving substantial support. However, many communities around the world are experiencing the same contamination indefinitely and with little or no support at all.

Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that was named one of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 10 most threatening public health concerns. UNICEF also reports that one-third of the world’s children are poisoned by lead, specifically in lower-income nations that cannot easily fight contamination. Luckily, international nonprofit organizations like Pure Earth are taking action to help countries overcome this common killer.

Poverty and Contamination

Beyond public health consequences, the crisis in Flint sparked national outrage in the U.S. because the contaminated water disproportionately affected minority communities. The dirtiest water flowed into these areas quickly and without warning. As a result, Hip-hop artist Mama Sol proclaims the treatment of Black people in the Flint crisis as a “cultural genocide” in the documentary “Faces of Flint: Hard to Swallow.”

Struggling families in Flint were commanded to pay their water bills despite the diseased water dripping from their faucets. Although the situation in Flint is not the model for typical contamination crises, it is crucial for the general populous to understand how poor, oppressed or disadvantaged groups are the most vulnerable victims.

The economic factors behind lead-contaminated water typically have deeper roots in impoverished nations that lack aid, infrastructure and support. Long-term lead exposure lowers gross domestic product (GDP) levels and devours economic potential. The economic limitation comes not only as a result of the workforce falling ill but also from lead-attributable intelligence quotient (IQ) reduction in the long-term.

In addition to hindering economic growth, lead-contaminated water harms countries developmentally. For example, with water sources being few and far between, many must drive to retrieve water. Increases in vehicle ownership demand larger recycling capacities. However, in countries where recycling is not as organized, well-financed or regulated, it is difficult to keep pace.

Causes

Lead contaminates water, food and other ordinary items in multiple ways. Industrial growth, unclean piping systems, inadequate disposal methods and agricultural mishaps play fundamental roles in rising lead levels. Bangladesh, in particular, suffers from improper lead-acid battery disposal, which affects 35.5 million children. Recycling practices in Bangladesh often give off open-air emissions close to communities. Blood lead levels are, therefore, well above the globally accepted maximum and are the 11th highest in the world. Other common sources of lead contamination include gasoline, paint, food cans, cosmetics, spices and toys.

The Philippines also has alarmingly high blood lead levels due to its rapid growth. An increase in the prevalence of agricultural practices over the last decade has contaminated clean water sources due to runoff. Strong rainfall in the archipelago causes water to move over the surface of the ground instead of seeping into the soil. This process gathers pesticides, fertilizers and other pollutants, accounting for more than 800,000 metric tons of organic pollution in the Philippines.

Effects of Lead Exposure

Toxic water contamination negatively affects more than 200 million people worldwide, a number comparable to HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria patients. Anemia, reproductive organ toxicity, kidney damage and cardiovascular disease are the most common symptoms of poisoning. Unfortunately, women and children are more likely to develop neurologic and immune system damage from the contamination.

Childhood lead exposure leads to an increased risk of developing mental disabilities and behavioral disorders. Shortened attention spans, antisocial behavior and reduced IQs disrupt education and contribute to the cycle of poverty. Fortunately, there are several steps parents, schools and communities can take to combat contamination.

Pollution Solutions

Prevention: Avoid paints, toys and other items that may contain lead. Case Reporting: Establish easy ways for victims to report symptoms. Treatment and Detection: Provide cognitive behavioral therapy to manage symptoms. Protection and Education: Conduct education campaigns about lead sources and dangers. Legislation and Policy: Create environmental, health and safety standards for recycling and manufacturing.

Pure Earth

Pure Earth is committed to reducing contamination in low-income countries that need financial support to implement prevention programs. In partnership with the U.N., the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, 21 government agencies and 34 other NGOs, Pure Earth has conducted more than 120 projects. These projects have impacted five million adults and one million children. The organization tailors its efforts specifically to each pollution site and supports local action by dividing projects into three categories:

Small Scale Clean-Ups: These are low-cost contamination sites that generally inspire further action. The operations require up to $100,000, community technical support and typically last one year.

Logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk is suing global commodity trader Glencore over an alleged bunker fuel contamination that it claims caused an engine failure in 2018.

The Sofie Maersk suffered total engine failure in the Pacific in March 2018, having to be towed to Hawaii. Maersk alleges fuel supplied by Glencore caused this, as well as pump damage in the Maersk Aras, news agency Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing court documents.

Maersk had received the fuel in an exchange of 24,000 gallons of bunkers between the two companies in Panama in February 2018, Bloomberg said.

Tests of the fuel found ""contaminants including plastic fibers, black hum, paraffins and fatty acids,"" Bloomberg cited the complaint as saying.

The case is being heard at a court in New York.

""Expansion of coal-mining up the Alberta Rockies chain will absolutely produce an environmental disaster for fish and wildlife health in what are now pristine, high-quality watersheds,"" Dennis Lemly wrote in an email to The Canadian Press.

Lemly is a retired U.S. government scientist who has published dozens of papers with hundreds of citations on coal-mining's impact.

""Have you ever seen an environmentally clean coal mine?"" Lemly asked in the email. ""I haven't in my investigations with Canada, the U.S. and other countries around the world for the past 45 years.""

'Effective treatment doesn't exist'

The Alberta government is developing a plan for public consultation on coal-mining after it backtracked on a decision to revoke a policy that had protected the mountains and foothills since 1976.

The government has repeatedly expressed its desire for a dramatically expanded industry in the region, which contains the headwaters for much of southern Alberta's drinking water, is home to threatened species and is an iconic part of the province's landscape.

Many companies have exploration permits and one mine proposed by Benga Mining is before regulatory hearings.

In 2019, Lemly published a peer-reviewed study of Benga's plans for coal extraction at Grassy Mountain near the Crowsnest Pass. The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Policy, was entered as evidence at the hearings.

Lemly, who has done consulting on coal pollution from Russia to Australia, is harshly critical of Benga's plans to handle selenium — a chemical that can produce deformities, nerve damage and reproductive failure in fish and birds, and remains in the environment long after its original source has stopped emitting.

""Leaching of selenium and resultant biological impacts is an undisputed fact of open-pit mountaintop coal-mining,"" Lemly wrote in his study. ""It will inevitably happen.

""Effective treatment doesn't exist.""

'Hollow promises'

He is not reassured by Benga's plan to treat contaminated water by storing it in the bottom layers of a wastewater pit to be transformed by microbes into a safe chemical.

""These ponds are notorious for breaching.""

Lemly also suggests that Benga's proposed pits would be too shallow to prevent surface and contaminated water from mixing. He writes the pits would also be likely to release contaminants into nearby streams or other surface waters, putting birds and wildlife at risk.

""To date, there has been no demonstration of effective treatment of leachate wastewater to render it safe to aquatic life in receiving waters at the scale and flows emanating from coal mines,"" the paper says.

""The proposed methods and techniques to protect water quality are simply hollow promises that carry no legitimate demonstration of prior success.""

Benga was not immediately available for comment.

Don't ask, don't tell

In his paper, Lemly points out that provincial and federal regulators have failed in the past to guard against selenium contamination. High levels from existing coal mines in Alberta have failed to produce regulatory action, he writes, although the problem has been known for more than two decades.

""Despite the scientific documentation of detrimental pollution impacts, it seems that this has been a long-running case of, 'Don't ask, don't tell' by government regulators in Alberta,"" the paper says.

""Current policy by (the Alberta Energy Regulator) reveals an extremely poor understanding and recognition of the key aquatic pollutant emanating from coal mines.""

Environment Canada's database shows no fines for selenium contamination at existing Alberta mines have ever been issued.

Lemly's paper warns about the likelihood of selenium-laced runoff affecting fish and birds far downstream. He writes the Crowsnest River and the Oldman River Reservoir would likely be affected by the Benga mine and warns other coal mine projects would likely produce the same risks.

Lemly notes that coal mines in British Columbia continue to contaminate watersheds despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent on remediation.

""This doesn't have to repeat itself in Alberta.""

The province is expected to announce soon its plans for public consultation on coal mines. The NDP Opposition continues to hold online town-hall meetings."

No matter how stringent controlled environments are, there is still a risk of contamination in every batch of product. Making sure that recalls are executed appropriately is equally, very important

Despite every effort, sometimes contamination events do occur in cleanroom or controlled environments. Three contamination FDA recalls in January that were interesting to follow were from Fresenius Kabi, Nostrum Laboratories, and Essaar. The products recalled were an injection batch, a tablet batch, and a batch of rubbing alcohol respectively.

Fresenius Kabi

In early January 2021, Fresenius Kabi USA voluntarily recalled a single lot of Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection to the user level due to the presence of particulate matter.

Particulate matter was detected through reserve sample vials.

""Administration of products containing particulate matter could obstruct blood vessels and result in local irritation of blood vessels, swelling at the site of injection, a mass of tissue that could become inflamed and infected, blood clots travelling to the lung, scarring of the lung tissues, and allergic reactions that could lead to life-threatening consequences,"" stated the FDA announcement.

Nostrum Laboratories

Later in January 2021, Missouri-based Nostrum voluntarily recalled one lot of Metformin HCl Extended Release Tablets to the consumer level. The tablets were found to contain levels of nitrosamine impurities above the ADI limit of 96 ng/day, as published in the FDA Guidance Document issued in September 2020. This is an expansion of the recall initially announced on 2 November 2020.

""NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products, and vegetables,"" stated the FDA announcement.

Essar

The month also saw Essaar voluntarily recalling a lot of Soho Fresh 70% Rubbing Alcohol to the consumer level. FDA analysis of the product revealed it is contaminated with methanol.

""Substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although all persons using these products on their hands are at risk, young children who accidentally ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute, are most at risk for methanol poisoning,"" stated the FDA announcement.

Following up

As all of these contamination events were recalled voluntarily, all three companies are following similar protocols for preventing the products reaching and harming end users.

Fresenius, Nostrum, and Essar are all notifying distributors of the products, either by letter or by email. Both Nostum and Essar are also arranging for return of all recalled products. Fresenius is also advising returning the product but gave further instruction for distributors to ""notify their customers and direct them to quarantine and discontinue distributing or dispensing the affected lot, and to return the product to Fresenius Kabi"".

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Agricultural workers who have long sought compensation for contamination from a pesticide banned in France but used in the country's Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe have finally had a day in court after a nearly 15-year wait.

Investigating magistrates in Paris held a videoconference hearing last month with representatives of consumer, farm and environmental groups gathered in a Martinique courtroom to determine how to proceed on a complaint that had languished since 2006.

“I have never given up,” said attorney Harry Durimel, speaking in a phone interview from Guadeloupe. “This is a serious matter that merits everyone’s involvement.”

The complaint focuses on chlordecone, a pesticide also known as Kepone that was banned in the U.S. in 1976 following several notorious incidents, including the contamination of the James River in Virginia, and which is blamed for neurological problems including slurred speech.

French health authorities have expressed concern it could be linked to high rates of prostate cancer on the eastern Caribbean islands and some studies have suggested it may be linked to premature births.

It was legally marketed in France from 1981 until 1990 and was used for three more years in Guadeloupe and Martinique to fight the banana weevil under an exemption granted by the French government.

Durimel and other attorneys argue that exemption was illegal. The suit accuses the French government of failing to protect the health of its people and not doing enough to identify and limit the effects of chlordecone pollution on both islands, with a combined population of some 750,000.

“They poisoned us in silence,” Durimel said.

France’s Ministry of the Overseas did not return a request for comment.

Durimel said France considers the pesticide to be so risky that in October 2002, it ordered the incineration of 1.5 tons of sweet potatoes that arrived at the port of Dunkirk from Martinique because they contained chlordecone.

The pesticide degrades slowly, with some experts estimating that the pollution in Martinique and Guadeloupe will last for decades or even centuries after its ban.

In Martinique, authorities temporarily banned fishing in all rivers and some coastal areas in 2009 after finding nearly all fish sampled were still contaminated. U.S. studies in the James River found tainted fish decades after Kepone was banned.

French officials had earlier prohibited the sale of any goods containing chlordecone and ordered that all soil be analyzed before the cultivation of root vegetables. But the complaint says those measures were not enforced and did not carry heavy penalties. In 2002, authorities seized several tons of chlordecone in Martinique and Guadeloupe.

“In the end it appears that the state has failed miserably in its mission to protect public health,” according to the complaint filed by Guadeloupe's Regional Consumers Union; SOS Environment Guadeloupe; the Agriculture, Society, Health, Environment group, and the Union of Agricultural Producers of Guadeloupe.

A 2015 article in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal summarized longstanding effects of the pesticide: “From 1999 to date, measurement of chlordecone in blood samples has revealed that a large proportion of the French West Indies population is still contaminated.""

It noted that 88% of samples collected from 100 adult men in Guadeloupe in 1998 contained chlordecone, and in 2004, chlordecone was detected in 87% of 122 women who were pregnant in Guadeloupe and in 77% of breast milk samples.

Years later, a study from 2005 to 2007 in Guadeloupe, found chlordecone in 67% of 623 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to the article.

It expressed concern about exposure during pregnancy and infant development ""and possibly long-term effects such as cancer.”

France has made several efforts to fight chlordecone contamination, and the most recent plan, to be launched in the coming weeks, has a $112 million budget, triple that of the previous plan, according to French officials. Proposed measures for the next six years include analyzing tap water, taking blood samples and monitoring people’s exposure levels. Officials also plan to map soils to identify the most contaminated areas.

But many activists remain unsatisfied, and the French government itself noted in a previous evaluation that multiple areas needed improvement,

The future of the slow-moving case isn't clear. The High Tribunal magistrates in Paris said some evidence has disappeared and suggested the statute of limitations might have expired on some alleged damage caused by the pesticide. No date for a follow-up hearing was set.

The plaintiffs' attorneys are demanding that officials find the missing documents and argue there is no statute of limitations in the case.

“While the complaint against the government doesn't specify possible remedies, Durimel said he envisions a fund to aid victims: “The goal is that those who polluted, pay.”

Alfred Marie-Jeanne, president of Martinique's executive council, wrote French President Emmanuel Macron last month saying he was stunned by the report of missing evidence and a possible time limit on damages suffered by people in Martinique and Guadeloupe.

“They feel they have been betrayed by the state and abandoned by those who should have defended them,” he wrote."

""How food is grown affects not only the concentration of contaminants, but also where the contaminants are stored within the food,"" says Seyfferth.
The 2020 ASA-CSSA-SSSA Annual Meeting was hosted by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.
###American Society of Agronomy, Soil Science Society of America, Crop Science Society of America: Collectively, these Societies represent more than 12,000 individual members around the world.
Together we work toward solutions to advance scientific knowledge in the areas of agronomy, crop science, and soil science.","rice, starts, silicon, cadmium, soil, food, society, arsenic, science, seyfferth, contaminants, contamination",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"When most people hear ""food contamination,"" they think of bacteria present on unwashed fruits or vegetables, or undercooked meat. However, there are other ways for harmful contaminants to be present in food products.

Angelia Seyfferth, a member of the Soil Science Society of America, investigates food contamination coming from the soil where the plants grow. ""It all comes down to the chemistry of the soil,"" explains Seyfferth.

Most recently, Seyfferth has been studying rice. The elements arsenic and cadmium can be present in the paddies where rice is grown. She presented her research at the virtual 2020 ASA-CSSA-SSSA Annual Meeting.

""Contaminants being taken up by crop plants is a route of dietary exposure to contaminants that is understudied,"" Seyfferth says. ""We can help decrease human exposure to toxins by applying our knowledge of soil chemistry.""

Small amounts of arsenic and cadmium are present all over the globe and can be detected in many food products. It's the concentration in the vegetable or fruit, the chemical form of the element, and how much of it someone eats that determines if an individual experiences a negative health effect.

High concentrations of arsenic and cadmium are harmful to the body. Consuming low doses over a long period of time can even cause cancer.

Elements like arsenic and cadmium can be in different chemical forms depending on their environment. Contaminants are taken up by plants when their chemical form in the soil resembles a nutrient the plant needs.

""How food is grown affects not only the concentration of contaminants, but also where the contaminants are stored within the food,"" says Seyfferth. ""If we understand the chemical forms of contaminants in soil, we can design solutions to decrease plant uptake of them.""

In rice, arsenic and cadmium uptake results from opposite conditions. Arsenic can be taken up when the field is flooded. Cadmium is more likely to be taken up when the field is not flooded.

Seyfferth's work has searched for a way to prevent plants from taking up arsenic and cadmium from the soil. This is often done by adding materials to the soil, called amendments.

An amendment helps change the soil environment. By changing the soil environment, researchers can help control the chemical forms and plant uptake of contaminants in the soil.

In this case, Seyfferth found that adding rice husk residue to rice paddy soils can help lower the amount of arsenic and cadmium taken up by the plants. Rice husk residue is plant material left over after processing rice for human consumption.

This solution is simple yet effective. Rice husk residue is high in the element silicon, which is an important nutrient for rice. The chemical form of silicon is similar to the form of arsenic taken up by rice plants when fields are flooded. This similarity helps 'distract' the plant, which prevents it from taking up as much arsenic.

In soils where cadmium is a problem, rice husk residue helps make the soil less acidic. This helps to lock up cadmium in the soil. The silicon in the husk may also help decrease the toxicity of cadmium.

""Not all sources of silicon behave the same way though,"" says Seyfferth. ""In order for it to be effective, the silicon source must provide silicon in a high enough concentration during the time the rice plant is filling grain. Rice husk residue is a successful source because it breaks down slowly and releases silicon throughout the growing season.""

High arsenic can decrease grain yield, but Seyfferth's work shows that adding rice husk residues can help prevent yield loss. Half of the world depends on rice as a staple food, so this research has exciting potential for positive impact.

In the past, Seyfferth has studied similar contamination issues in mushrooms.

For most American adults, the amount of arsenic and cadmium they consume from rice and mushrooms is not enough to cause concern. But there are other populations that eat these products more frequently and from an early age.

""People need to be aware of their daily load of contaminants, which depends on their body weight, the concentration and chemical form of the contaminant in the food, and the amount consumed,"" Seyfferth explains.

""The daily load is highest for people who consume rice multiple times a day and who may also have arsenic in their drinking water,"" she says. ""Some examples include populations in South and Southeast Asia.""

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the University of Delaware.

The suit, filed Tuesday in Waukesha County Circuit Court, seeks to block the DNR’s ability to require cleanup of unregulated “emerging contaminants,” such as PFAS, the “forever chemicals” that have polluted groundwater in sites across the state, including Madison.

Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and Leather-Rich Inc, or LRI, claim the DNR is subverting the law in the way it administers two environmental cleanup programs by changing policies and enforcing cleanup standards for substances without going through a lengthy rule-making process.

According to the complaint, Joanne Kantor and her late husband operated LRI for more than four decades before she decided to retire and sell the property in 2018.

Kantor informed the DNR that the site was likely contaminated with volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, a chemical used in dry cleaning. She hired a consultant to do an investigation and entered a voluntary remediation program.

But the complaint says the DNR would not approve a cleanup plan unless it also tested for PFAS. According to the complaint, Kantor has spent more than $235,000 and has been forced to keep the business going to cover the costs.

A statute known as the “spills law” gives the DNR authority to regulate the discharge of hazardous substances, which the law defines as anything “that can cause harm to human health and safety, or the environment, because of where it is spilled, the amount spilled, its toxicity or its concentration.”

There is no definitive list of hazardous substances, which can include toxic chemicals as well manure, corn, or even milk and beer that in high concentrations can foul public waters and kill aquatic life.

“Defendants freely change what substances and concentrations of substances are considered a ‘hazardous substance’...without notice, and with no public input or legislative oversight,” the complaint states. “Through these changes, Defendants continually move the goal posts for the regulated community, prolonging cases, and preventing closure and redevelopment of properties.”

WMC argues the DNR should be required to go through the rule-making process to establish a list of what it considers hazardous substances and at what quantities or concentrations.

They are asking the court to block the agency from enforcing cleanup of any “emerging contaminants” including PFAS, a group of more than 4,000 substances that have been linked to cancer and other ailments.

DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said Tuesday that the agency was still reviewing the complaint.

WMC has fought the DNR’s efforts to regulate PFAS through ongoing rule-making actions that would set standards for ground, surface and drinking water as well as limiting the use and disposal of firefighting foam that contains the fluorinated compounds.

The DNR is monitoring more than 40 PFAS contamination sites around the state, including one linked to a Marinette manufacturer of firefighting foam that could result in the state’s largest-ever environmental cleanup.

Several contaminated sites at the Madison airport have been linked to training areas used for decades by the Wisconsin Air National Guard and local fire departments. The DNR has ordered the city, county and National Guard to clean up the sites.

It is thought that ethylene oxide was used to stop the growth of Salmonella during the storage of sesame seeds in India.
Suppliers who delivered contaminated batches include Dhairya International, Nature Bio Foods Ltd., Agri Food Products, GSV International, Shyam Industries and Dhaval Agri Exports.
The maximum residue limit for sesame seeds is set at 0.05 milligrams per kilogram.
Ethylene oxide is a volatile and reactive compound that only remains in tiny amounts in treated foods, according to officials.","products, eu, continue, recalls, seeds, oxide, sesame, food, seed, europe, india, contaminated, ethylene, european, mgkg",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"A European alert food system is nearing 500 reports because of the unauthorized substance ethylene oxide in products with sesame seeds.

Belgium made the first alert in early September 2020 in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) concerning pesticide residues in various lots of sesame seeds from India. Three months later, most European countries have been affected.

Thousands of conventional and organic products with long shelf life dates such as cereals, chocolate, biscuits, bread, crackers, sesame oil, bagels, and Asian dishes have been affected.

More than half of the EU’s annual imports of 70,000 tons of sesame comes from India.

Additional checks

The European Commission strengthened checks on sesame seeds from India in October 2020 with regulation requiring they are tested prior to export to the EU to certify compliance and include an official certificate. The rules also increased checks at border control posts with controls needed on 50 percent of all consignments at the EU border. They are already on the list of products subject to extra checks because of Salmonella.

It is thought that ethylene oxide was used to stop the growth of Salmonella during the storage of sesame seeds in India.

Suppliers who delivered contaminated batches include Dhairya International, Nature Bio Foods Ltd., Agri Food Products, GSV International, Shyam Industries and Dhaval Agri Exports.

In the EU, the use of ethylene oxide for the disinfection of foodstuffs is not permitted because it is classed as a carcinogen and mutagen. The maximum residue limit for sesame seeds is set at 0.05 milligrams per kilogram. Use is allowed in the Unites States at 7 mg/kg for sesame seeds. Levels found by Belgium were as high as 186 mg/kg but mostly between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg. Some batches exceeded the maximum limit by more than 1,000 times.

Ethylene oxide is a volatile and reactive compound that only remains in tiny amounts in treated foods, according to officials. Detecting and calculating the amount of the substance in food is a complicated process that, for financial reasons, is only used for individual cases in routine food monitoring programs, according to CVUA Stuttgart.

Other foods or countries involved?

Member state experts, the EU Commission, and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) held a food and feed crisis coordinators meeting in October. Some countries called for reinforced vigilance on products like pepper and spices where past analysis also showed ethylene oxide.

In late November 2020 there was a meeting in the phytopharmaceuticals and residues section of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed committee that mentioned ethylene oxide.

One country said its national assessment indicated the current MRL of 0.05 mg/kg may not sufficiently protect some consumer groups. Another reported finding ethylene oxide in products not from India but they were compliant with the associated MRLs.

A report from the EU Reference Laboratory for Residues of Pesticides said it is unknown for how long ethylene oxide-fumigation has been in use or increasingly applied to sesame seeds in India but experts suspect it has been common practice for years.

An assessment in Belgium indicated a potential chronic risk. This means that if a consumer was to have the implicated seeds every day of their life, and in large quantities, there could be a risk to health. An assessment by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and Wageningen Food Safety Research found it was “hardly possible” to eat safe quantities of bread, crackers, or cookies with sesame seeds containing ethylene oxide at a level of 10 mg/kg.

In November, the Food Standards Agency said it was not advocating a full consumer recall of affected products and favored a withdrawal as the risk to individuals is low and most products already purchased are likely to have been consumed, making such a recall disproportionate.

The Springvale H & T water treatment plant registered a contamination level of 25 parts per trillion, above the state's safe level of 20 parts per trillion. In October, the state tightened the safety standard which had been 70 parts per trillion.

Operations at the Springvale plant are reduced while other water sources in town will be used to meet demand.

PFAS6 is a combination of man-made chemicals used to make certain items, including fire-fighting foams and moisture and stain-resistant products. The use of PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in American manufacturing stopped 30 years ago, but are still found in some imported products.

Wednesday night, acting Town Administrator Robert Rooney told the Select Board that “disposal of products” could be a source of the contamination.

The town notified its water customers on Feb. 3 of the contamination.

Not in violation

Natick did not violate the state’s drinking water regulations, according to the notice sent to customers. A PFAS6 violation occurs when the average of all monthly samples collected over a three-month period exceeds 20 parts per trillion.

The quarterly average is not yet recorded, because April 1 is when towns the size of Natick are required to start testing its water systems for PFAS6.

Natick started testing for PFAS6 in November and December 2020.

Possible adverse health effects

Drinking water with more than 20 parts per trillion can harm the liver, blood, immune system, thyroid and fetal development and also increase the risk of certain cancers.

Some at-risk groups are advised by the state Department of Environmental Protection to to use bottled water for drinking and cooking when there is an elevated level of PFAS6. If bottled water is used, it should be tested for PFAS6.

At-risk groups include pregnant or nursing women, infants, and those with compromised immune systems.

For those not in the at-risk groups, the MassDEP does not have a recommendation on whether to drink and use the water. The town's notice said those customers can drink it.

'Inactive' water source has elevated PFAS6 level

Morses Pond, an ""inactive"" water source, registered the highest level of contamination - 33.89 parts per trillion. The pond hasn’t pumped water into Natick’s system in roughly five years. Currently, the pond’s well is being replaced with new wells, and won’t be used until treatment is added to remove PFAs.

Rooney reported that monthly water samples will now be posted on the town’s website.

Additionally, Rooney told the board the state’s safe level of 20 parts per trillion falls below the federal standard of 70 parts per trillion. More than a dozen Massachusetts communities currently exceed 20 parts per trillion, according to Rooney.

The base has recommended people use bottled water for drinking and cooking but deemed tap water safe for bathing and laundry.
Brig Gen Gregory Kreuder, commander of Luke air force base, said a study showed the chemicals may have affected “supply wells that provide drinking water” to properties nearby.
“We share community concerns about the potential impact of these compounds on drinking water,” he said.
The chemicals also have been discovered around the Peterson air force base in Colorado Springs.","distributing, state, force, near, contamination, water, air, federal, phoenix, chemicals, drinking, base, bases, contaminated, bottled",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"The US air force says it will be distributing bottled water to thousands of residents and business owners near its base in suburban Phoenix until at least April, marking the latest case of chemicals from military firefighting efforts contaminating the water supply in a nearby community.

Luke air force base announced this month that studies showed high levels of contaminants had affected drinking water for about 6,000 people in roughly 1,600 homes as well as a few neighboring businesses.

A contractor is scheduling deliveries of drinking water to the homes of people who picked up their first bottles this week, said Sean Clements, chief of public affairs for the 56th Fighter Wing at the base. Those deliveries will go on until a long-term filtration facility can be set up in April, Clements said on Thursday.

The base has recommended people use bottled water for drinking and cooking but deemed tap water safe for bathing and laundry.

Similar contamination tied to the use of firefighting foam has been found in water supplies near dozens of military sites in Arizona, Colorado and other states and has triggered hundreds of lawsuits. Growing evidence that it is dangerous to be exposed to the chemicals found in the foam has prompted the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to consider setting a maximum level for those chemicals in drinking water nationwide.

But they are not regulated now, meaning the base cannot be punished even though the EPA says the chemicals stay in the body for long periods and may cause adverse health effects.

The Arizona corporation commission, which regulates utilities, is scheduling an emergency meeting next week with five water companies to discuss concerns about the contamination, said Caroline Oppleman, spokeswoman for the Arizona department of environmental quality.

Oppleman said her agency is working with the base, regulators and federal and local officials to ensure actions are taken to ensure healthy drinking water for residents.

A statement from Luke air force base last week said testing had detected levels of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate above the EPA’s health advisory for how much should be consumed in drinking water over a person’s lifetime.

The so-called forever chemicals from a class known collectively as PFAS were found during tests of water from Valley Utilities Water Co. The compounds are used in many industrial and consumer products and in foam used by commercial industries and the armed services to extinguish fuel fires.

The company said its water meets all EPA and Arizona drinking water standards and that no treatment is required because PFAS are not regulated by federal or state environmental agencies. The chief financial officer, Bryan Thomas, said the utility nevertheless is working with the base on “additional sampling and potential water treatment options”.

Brig Gen Gregory Kreuder, commander of Luke air force base, said a study showed the chemicals may have affected “supply wells that provide drinking water” to properties nearby.

“We share community concerns about the potential impact of these compounds on drinking water,” he said.

The contamination problem is well known in neighboring New Mexico, where chemicals from several bases have seeped into local water supplies.

The state sued the US air force in 2019 over groundwater contamination at Cannon and Holloman air bases, saying the federal government has a responsibility to clean up plumes of toxic chemicals left behind by past military firefighting activities.

In court documents, the state describes the contamination detected at the bases as shocking, saying it migrated into public and private wells that provide drinking water and livestock and irrigation water to surrounding communities.

New Mexico said its dairy industry has been affected as well as residential and commercial property values.

This year, the state challenged a federal court’s decision to combine its lawsuit over contamination at air force bases with similar litigation brought by hundreds of other jurisdictions nationwide.

The New Mexico attorney general’s office and state environment department argue the decision to centralize the claims violated the state’s sovereignty and could lead to extreme delays that further endanger public health and the environment.

The US Air Force Academy in 2019 said unsafe levels of PFAS chemicals were found in groundwater at four sites on its Colorado Springs campus, south of Denver. The chemicals also have been discovered around the Peterson air force base in Colorado Springs.

Pork plant owners are also allowed to accelerate slaughter-line speeds faster than in conventional plants, which critics say lessens the opportunity to find contamination.

The data shows that the five plants used in the test program were cited by USDA inspectors nearly twice as often for having fecal and digestive matter on the hog carcasses when they reached the end of the slaughter line. The USDA has a zero-tolerance policy for this type of contamination, which contains high levels of deadly human pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella.

The records, obtained by the nonprofit consumer group Food and Water Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request, compared the test plants with 21 traditional plants of comparable size from 2014 to 2017, the years immediately preceding the push to expand the program.

Testing for the new rules went on for more than 20 years before the Trump administration turned it into a full-fledged program.

“This data shows that when swine slaughter plants are left to police themselves, as they are under the Trump administration’s new inspection rules, there is more fecal matter and digestive contents that ends up on the food we eat,” said Zach Corrigan, senior attorney for the organization.

The Trump-era system remains in effect under President Biden. To reverse or alter it, the new administration would probably have to propose and successfully finalize a new regulation, a process that can take years.

Biden has not taken a public position on the inspection system. However, in a town hall last year, he said he opposed USDA regulations that have allowed the meat industry to increase slaughter line speeds, citing worker safety concerns.

“Whether it’s cattle, whether it’s beef, whether it’s pigs, whether it’s chicken, they’re moving down that line faster and faster and faster to increase the profit rate,” Biden said. “People are getting sicker. People are getting hurt.”

The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service declined to comment for this article, citing pending litigation over the new inspection system. Three separate lawsuits are seeking to halt use of the new system, citing food safety, worker safety and animal welfare concerns.

Food and Water Watch filed one of the lawsuits last year with two other nonprofits, Center for Food Safety and Humane Farming Association. The lawsuit was amended Thursday to include the new data.

Under Trump, the USDA defended its efforts to transfer more control of food safety oversight to the pork industry. Officials there said federal inspectors spend less time assessing the quality of the pork with the new system, which gives them more time to look for disease and contamination. Foodborne illnesses, they said, typically come from microscopic pathogens that are best detected through testing.

Story continues below advertisement

The North American Meat Institute, a trade group for the industry, said in a statement that the higher citation rates in the test plants does not necessarily mean more pork is being contaminated. The new system requires that USDA inspectors perform at least twice as many inspection tasks off the slaughter line — sometimes referred to as spot checks — as they do in traditional plants. This is probably the cause for the higher rate of citations, said spokeswoman Sarah Little.

However, Corrigan said the rates account for this, because they were calculated by looking at the number of violations per spot check. “The rate per spot check nearly doubled,” he said. Corrigan said that means that plant employees on the slaughter line — where USDA inspectors once worked — are failing to remove the contamination before it reaches the end of the slaughter line.

Little countered by saying the offline inspections can often include the evaluation of more hog carcasses than the traditional plants do.

The lawsuit in which Food and Water Watch is a plaintiff seeks to stop the new inspection system, claiming it will harm consumers by eliminating statutory requirements that federal government inspectors perform critical inspection responsibilities. It also says that the new system conflicts with requirements of the 1906 Federal Meat Inspection Act, which requires that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under strictly regulated sanitary conditions.

Earlier this month, a federal judge denied the USDA’s motion to dismiss the case, saying the groups had legal standing to pursue their claims.

In his ruling, Judge Jeffrey S. White said that he concluded “there is a credible threat that [their] members face an increased risk of illness from consuming adulterated pork products because of the [new rules], sufficiently establishing standing based on potential future harm.”

For more than a decade, USDA inspectors at the test plants said that under the program, hogs fly by them so quickly — as many six per minute — that they cannot spot fecal matter that contains deadly pathogens. They also say plant employees who have replaced them are less likely to stop the slaughter line to remove the contamination or to throw out the carcass because such actions can cut into profits.

Beyond the five plants in the test program, the USDA estimates that 35 additional pork plants are expected to use the new system. They would collectively produce 90 percent of pork consumed in the United States, USDA records show.

Although there have been huge advances in food safety in meatpacking plants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about a half-million people become ill and 82 die each year from consuming pathogen-laced pork products. Hog plants produce about 11 million tons of pork products annually, and 75 percent of it is sold in the United States, according to industry statistics.

The inspection program has faced harsh criticism by government auditors and investigators.

In May 2013, the USDA’s inspector general issued a report that found three of the five plants in the trial program had numerous health and safety violations. Safety records at those three plants were worse than those at hundreds of other U.S. hog plants that continued to operate under the traditional system, auditors found."

First, Nasa’s Perseverance rover is due to land on the planet later this month. Then China’s Tianwen rover will follow in May. Both missions intend to search the planet for signs of life.

But how do we make sure when our landers touch down on the red planet’s surface, nothing unwanted is landing with them? If we aren’t careful, we could be spreading all sorts of life – like in 2019, when a spacecraft crashed onto the moon’s surface with a cargo of tiny, almost indestructible lifeforms called tardigrades.

The good thing is, we have policies and laws to prevent this from happening. In fact, there’s an entire section of space law, called planetary protection, designed to prevent planets, moons, comets and asteroids from being contaminated.

For 50 years, governmental organisations have stuck to the generally accepted rules and laws. But they are no longer the only players in the game. An increasing number of commercial space missions are taking off.

Planetary protection

There are two variants of planetary protection, called forwards and backwards. The former concerns the contamination of other planets by material taken from Earth. This protects any life that may be on those planets, of course. But it also means scientists can be reasonably certain any signs of life they discover are actually signs of “extraterrestrial” life and not transplanted from Earth.

To achieve this, the rooms in which spacecraft are made and put together are some of the cleanest places on Earth. The facilities are regularly tested for any biological contamination, and often throw up surprising results. In 2013 a completely new type of bacteria was found in two clean rooms around 4,000km (2,500 miles) apart. The life form, which survives on eating very little, was found nowhere else on Earth.

Backwards contamination is preventing Earth being contaminated by extraterrestrial material that has hitched a ride back. In 1969, when the Apollo 11 astronauts landed back on Earth, they spent three weeks in quarantine to make sure they didn’t bring anything dangerous back from the moon. Neil Armstrong even celebrated his 39th birthday in there.

We have since learnt much more about the moon, and it’s generally considered to be microbe free. The chances of bringing anything back to Earth would be much greater if missions were to bring samples, or humans, back from Mars.

The laws

Planetary protection has a long history. The committee on space research (COSPAR), an international non-governmental organisation, began discussing it as early as the 1950s, when planned missions to the moon raised concerns about the potential for contamination to effect later scientific investigations.

Since then COSPAR’s planetary protection policy, with its scientific guidelines and recommendations, has become the internationally recognised “gold standard”. It categorises planets and moons based on their potential for life or signs of life, past or present. The greater the potential for life, the greater the protective measures. By this categorisation, Mars is better protected than the moon.

This means missions to higher category bodies require more sterilisation to ensure fewer potential contaminates travel. It can also affect end-of-life-plans for missions. Nasa’s Juno probe will be crashed into Jupiter this July in order to avoid potential contamination of Europa or any of the other moons.

But as the product of a non-governmental organisation, the COSPAR policy is not legally binding. It’s what lawyers refer to as “soft law”. This means it doesn’t have the force of a legally binding agreement but is still recognised as an important guideline that should be followed.

That said, we do have an obligation under international law to avoid the harmful contamination of outer space, the moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the Earth. This is due to the Outer Space Treaty of 1967.

While the treaty states “harmful contamination” should be avoided, it does not define what this means. However, the past 50 years establishes a fairly strong expectation that future missions will also comply with these principles.

On top of this, there’s a social and moral aspect to the obligation. Space scientists expect missions to comply with the planetary protection principles. To not do so risks condemnation from the scientific community.

Non-governmental spaceflight

The days of space beyond Earth orbit only being explored by government scientific operations are coming to a close. Private companies are increasingly venturing further away from our planet. The lunar landing attempt in 2019 that potentially contaminated the moon was by a private company, called SpaceIL. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is aiming to launch missions to Mars.

This doesn’t mean space will become a lawless wild west, because states are responsible for the activities of their nationals in outer space. They’re required to authorise and continually supervise these activities. If damage is done, it’s the state that is liable, not the private company. But many states include insurance policies as part of granting a licence.

The future

It’s difficult to predict how this will play out, particularly given the limited directly relevant precedent. However, the general approach taken so far by the US government is encouraging. Recently, Nasa updated its planetary protection policy to explicitly stipulate it is the implementation of the US’ obligations under the Outer Space Treaty.

Based on this, it’s reasonable to assume any licence granted by the US would require they adhere to the Nasa planetary protection policy, which broadly aligns with the COPSAR policy.

This isn’t guaranteed to be maintained forever. Attempts in the US Congress to potentially exempt private actors from planetary protection requirements have already happened, as part of a bill in 2018 to reduce the “regulatory burden” on the commercial space industry. The efforts failed, but those who supported it may try again.

Planetary protection is important for maintaining the scientific value of outer space. But scientific interest is not the only reason for exploring outer space – there are many others. Where the balance lies will need to be considered, but it’s a debate that needs wide participation."

Contaminated drinking water can pose serious health risks to vulnerable groups.
In doing so, EPA is required to consider whether more vulnerable groups of people are at greater risk of harm.
EPA should re-commit to studying the health threats that contaminated drinking water poses to vulnerable groups of people.
Doing so will help strengthen drinking water safeguards and ensure that those who are most at risk are adequately protected from harm.","research, protect, congress, vulnerable, water, epa, health, groups, drinking, risks, report, contamination",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"Twenty-five years ago, Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency to research the health risks that contaminated drinking water poses to vulnerable groups of people, including infants, children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Congress instructed EPA to undertake an ongoing research program to study these risks and report back on the results periodically.

EPA started this research and sent an initial report to Congress in December 2000. In that report, EPA summarized the wide range of studies it had initiated, much of which was just getting underway. And EPA reported that “new insights are expected within the next few years,” as the results of ongoing work become available.

More than two decades have passed since EPA outlined its initial research program and predicted that new insights would be coming soon. Yet EPA has not made any subsequent report to Congress on the results. In light of recent lead contamination crises in Flint, Michigan and Newark, New Jersey—and with growing awareness of widespread drinking water problems elsewhere in the United States—it is time for EPA to update its research regarding harm to vulnerable groups of people, and to share its latest conclusions with Congress and the public. And it is past time for EPA to set new safety standards and revise existing ones to protect the people most at risk of harm.

Contaminated drinking water can pose serious health risks to vulnerable groups. Lead is a well-known example. Fetal exposure to lead in drinking water threatens health harms that include behavioral problems, learning impairment, and lower IQ. But last year EPA weakened the safeguards that help keep lead out of drinking water. Nitrate is another example. Infants who drink baby formula prepared with nitrate-contaminated water can develop “blue baby syndrome,” which is potentially fatal, and pregnant mothers exposed to low levels of nitrate may have a higher risk of having a child with certain birth defects. Yet EPA has not revised its nitrate standard in nearly half a century, despite mounting evidence that it fails to protect children. By studying and acting on these and other risks, EPA can make sure that current standards are as protective as they need to be.

The required research should inform new safeguards too. Under the law, EPA must decide whether to set limits for currently unregulated contaminants that endanger people’s health. In doing so, EPA is required to consider whether more vulnerable groups of people are at greater risk of harm. Prime candidates for future regulation include PFOA, PFOS, and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (known as PFAS), which can pose grave risks to infants, children, and people with compromised immune systems. Without up-to-date research on risks to sensitive groups, EPA will overlook or fail to act on dangerous contaminants.

EPA should re-commit to studying the health threats that contaminated drinking water poses to vulnerable groups of people. EPA should also update its decades-old report to Congress with new information about these risks. Doing so will help strengthen drinking water safeguards and ensure that those who are most at risk are adequately protected from harm."

You are a policyholder whose business has been decimated by COVID-19. You tender a claim to your insurer under your policy—which does not contain a virus, communicable disease, or pandemic exclusion—for business interruption losses based upon the presence of COVID-19 at the insured properties. In response, your insurer denies coverage on the bases, among others, that COVID-19 exposure implicates exclusions in your policy for pollution or contamination.

For example, some property policies contain an exclusion that includes language such as “[t]he actual, alleged or threatened release, discharge, escape or dispersal of pollutants or contaminants, all whether direct or indirect, proximate or remote or in whole or in part caused by, contributed to or aggravated by any covered cause of loss under this Policy” and purport to define “pollutants or contaminants” as any “solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste, which after its release can cause or threaten damage to human health or human welfare or causes or threatens damage, deterioration, loss of value, marketability or loss of use to property insured hereunder, including, but not limited to, bacteria, virus, or hazardous substances.”

Is your insurer correct in denying coverage under pollution or contamination exclusions? Not in our view. Faced with the undesirable reality that no viable grounds exist upon which to deny coverage, insurers have resorted to what we believe are inapplicable policy exclusions in an improper effort to shirk their policy obligations.

With respect to pollution exclusions, for example, the California Supreme Court determined in MacKinnon v. Truck Insurance Exchange that such exclusions only refer to things commonly understood as traditional environmental pollution, and should not be read expansively to encompass more than that. A narrow interpretation of a pollution exclusion, we assert, is correct.

Two recent decisions in the COVID-19 context are in accord, and refused to apply a pollution exclusion to business interruption claims based on COVID-19. In JGB Vegas Retail Lessee, LLC v. Starr Surplus Lines Ins. Co., the District Court for Clark County, Nevada determined that “Starr has not shown that it is unreasonable to interpret the Pollution and Contamination Exclusion to apply only to instances of traditional environmental and industrial pollution and contamination that is not at issue here, where JGB’s losses are alleged to be the result of a naturally-occurring, communicable disease…. This is the case, even though the Exclusion contains the word ‘virus.’” In Urogynecology Specialist of Florida v. Sentinel Insurance, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida found that “[d]enying coverage for losses stemming from COVID-19, however, does not logically align with the grouping of the virus exclusion with other pollutants such that the Policy necessarily anticipated and intended to deny coverage for these kinds of business losses.”

Obviously, the presence of COVID-19 should not be seen as constituting traditional environmental pollution for purposes of pollution exclusions in property insurance policies.

Similarly, many contamination exclusions in property insurance policies are often tied to pollution concepts (i.e., the “method of travel”) such as “release” and “discharge,” making them more akin to pollution exclusions that should have no application to COVID-19 claims. Additionally, broadly worded contamination exclusions have been found to be unenforceable given that they purport to exclude coverage for anything that could possibly be construed as contamination, rendering such purported exclusions anything but conspicuous, plain, and clear as required by law in many jurisdictions. Indeed, contamination exclusions are often so poorly worded as to raise concerns about illusory coverage.

Although the case law continues to develop, a best practice for policyholders is to not assume that an insurer’s reliance on a stated exclusion is permissible or applicable. A further best practice for insureds is to promptly consult with coverage counsel to advise them of their rights, especially when insurers purport to resort to exclusions like this to deny coverage for COVID-19 claims."

LA CROSSE, Wis. (WKBT)- The La Crosse Common Council voted Thursday evening to approve hiring two law firms to represent the city in litigation against chemical companies involved in the PFAS contamination on French Island.

Both the Finance & Personnel Committee and the full council approved the move.

La Crosse Mayor Tim Kabat said on Tuesday the city was planning to file suit against the manufacturers of the chemicals and he strongly encouraged impacted residents to join forces with their effort.

125 people from the Town of Campbell have well water that is contaminated with the hazardous PFAS chemical. The man-made chemical was used to produce the fire-fighting foam that was sprayed at the La Crosse Airport for decades.

This fall, the city learned PFAS was in the ground at the airport, and spread to more than 100 private wells, according to the city’s own tests.

The PFAS levels in nearly half of the homes are so high, the water is unsafe to drink, cook with, or use to brush your teeth.

The city could also be facing a lawsuit of its own.

Earlier this week, Attorney Tim Jacobson who represents 125 residents in the Town of Campbell, served the city a “notice of circumstances of claim and injury” which is required by law before a party can sue a municipality.

Mayor Kabat said, “Personally, I do not understand why Attorney Jacobson is trying to sow division between the residents of Campbell and the City of La Crosse, as we are both victims of these manufactured chemicals and have been negatively impacted.”

“Our hope and goal is that we can negotiate informally and amicably with the city to find a resolution that works for the citizens of French Island,” said Jacobson.

Jacobson is also planning to take action against the chemical manufacturers and said he hopes the city will work with him.

Key points: PFAS and fuel contaminants have been found in groundwater and soil on five Queensland residential properties

PFAS and fuel contaminants have been found in groundwater and soil on five Queensland residential properties The contamination dates back to the 1990s

The contamination dates back to the 1990s Ampol says there is no risk to health but researchers say long-term exposure may be dangerous

The five blocks belonging to the three owners border an Ampol-owned Caltex fuel depot in Bundaberg.

Anita Penny bought her property in the city's east in 1998, but 23 years on it is now contaminated and losing value.

She said she cannot sell or rent out the Collins Street property and is unable to grow and eat fruit or vegetables from her garden.

""To be told that the house you have been paying off for 20 years is now completely worthless was absolutely devastating,"" Ms Penny said.

""We are paying a mortgage on a house that is useless. We are unable to sell it or rent it on the open market because it is contaminated.""

Ampol says PFAS has been found beneath its Bundaberg depot, in roadside wells and on one residential property. ( ABC Wide Bay: Nicole Hegarty )

Contamination dates back to 1990s

Ampol notified the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES) of the presence of hydrocarbon contamination at its Bundaberg depot in December 2013.

An Ampol spokesman said testing of roadside wells in 2014 and 2015 also revealed contaminants, while traces of hydrocarbons were found in groundwater and soil at five properties neighbouring the site in 2017 and 2018.

""Comprehensive and ongoing testing and monitoring to date has shown this contamination in its current site does not present a risk to human health,"" he said.

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl PFAS, often referred to as 'forever chemicals' due to their resistance to breaking down, was found in quantities above the adopted human health guidelines beneath the depot, in roadside reserve wells, and on the property furthest away from the depot.

Levels below the adopted guidelines for human health were detected at some of the remaining properties.

Ms Penny and the other residents approached by the ABC said they were first advised of the contamination at the depot by a letter in October 2016.

The two other property owners did not want to talk publicly about their circumstances.

Ms Penny said she was told there were two types of leaks.

""One was historic dating back to the 90s [prior to Ampol taking ownership] and then a second lot dated back to about four years ago,"" she said.

Ampol says the contamination does not present a risk to human health. ( ABC Wide Bay: Nicole Hegarty )

Monitoring wells have since been installed on each site in compliance with a Clean-Up Notice from the DES.

""Whenever they are doing testing they have to come into the yard and it usually takes a couple of hours. They also have to block off the road to traffic to test all the monitoring wells on the road and on the side of the road,"" Ms Penny said.

""It's generally every six months.""

The Clean-Up Notice, issued in June 2020, required Ampol to implement a groundwater monitoring program to monitor changes in the concentrations of contaminants in soil and groundwater.

House dreams down the drain

Ms Penny bought the property in an industrial-residential area of the city's east with her father as it allowed him to continue his engineering business.

""The reason Dad and I got it together was so that I could use it as collateral to purchase my own house down the track,"" she said.

Instead, she has had to list her other property she calls home, purchased with her husband, on the market.

""We're actually having to sell our house and move back here to this contaminated property because we can't continue to maintain two mortgages especially for another three to five years,"" she said.

""Something that's not our fault is causing us to lose a house that we worked really hard to get.""

Groundwater and soil-monitoring are installed around the properties. ( ABC Wide Bay: Nicole Hegarty )

'Sit in garden, but don't grow vegetables'

RMIT's Associate Dean of Biosciences Professor Oliver Jones said small amounts of petrol would cause limited human harm but long-term exposure could be more serious.

""Unless you've got a large amount for a long period of time, it's probably not something to be immediately concerned about,"" Professor Jones said.

""Groundwater is probably not so much of a problem unless you are using it as a drinking water source or putting it on the garden.

""If you were exposed every day for five, 10 years then you might start to be a little more concerned.

""With the soil, it would depend on how much is there and what depth it is at and what you were doing with the soil.

""So if you were just going to sit in your garden each day that's different to if you were growing vegetables and then eating them.""

Professor Oliver Jones says little is known about the risks of low-level PFAS exposure. ( ABC News: Billy Draper )

Professor Jones said only limited research existed on the effects of lower-level PFAS exposure.

""With hydrocarbons, wherever you store oil underground there is always the potential that you might get a leakage but generally it's pretty well known what the risks are where it might be,"" he said.

""PFAS is only an emerging contaminant.

""If it's shown that these levels in the area in question are over the regulated levels and maybe there is a potential risk then I think people should be looking to either remediate or address the issue.""

The DES said it was continuing to assess contamination at surrounding properties.

The residential properties have not been listed on the Environmental Management Register (EMR), which publicly lists contaminated or potentially contaminated land.

Ms Penny approached Ampol with an offer to purchase her property in 2019 and again in 2020.

An Ampol spokesman said the company would not proceed with that option but would consider compensation.

""While contamination presents no health risks, we acknowledge the issues created and the potential disruption from ongoing remediation works,"" he said.

In the meantime, Ms Penny said the wait continued.

""We just have to wait for Caltex to take action and move back to this contaminated property,"" she said.

Ms Penny said she was exploring her legal options with a lawyer."

Six tests since August have shown elevated levels of the highly poisonous heavy metal in the east Otago towns' drinking water, with the highest reading 39 times the acceptable limit.

So why did it take so long for the public to find out? How dangerous is the problem? And what is known about the towns?

RNZ explains.

Where are Waikouaiti and Karitane?

The two small coastal settlements both sit north of Dunedin. State Highway 1 traces through the centre of Waikouaiti about 33km north of central Dunedin. Karitane sits about 5km south of Waikouaiti off State Highway 1 along Coast Road. According to the 2018 census, 1194 people are usually resident in Waikouaiti, up from 1122 in 2013. According to the 2013 census, 360 people called Karitane home.

Both towns are within the Dunedin City Council area. The towns' tap water system is separate from the main city supply and a small treatment plant sits near the Waikouaiti River, which feeds the plant. The treatment facility was upgraded in 2009. In 2016, Dunedin City Council trumpeted ""Dunedin's drinking water is now among the best in the country, after a 21-year programme to improve its quality"" following upgrades to the city's supply starting in 1995.

The towns are home to a large proportion of holiday homes and would have expected a boost this weekend due to the Waitangi Day long weekend.

Who knew what and when?

So far six tests since 31 July last year have shown concerning levels of lead in the town's water supply.

The first was taken at the Waikouaiti golf club on 31 July 2020. Its results came back on 14 August showing lead at levels of 0.0295mg per litre of water (about three times the acceptable level).

Another taken from the golf club on 9 October 2020 returned levels of 0.0121mg/L a week later.

A test taken from the golf club on 8 December 2020 came back 10 days later showing 0.394mg/L (almost 40 times the acceptable level), while a test taken on the same day at Karitane bowls club showed lead at levels of 0.072mg/L (more than seven times the acceptable level).

Another test at the golf club on 7 January this year, showed 0.0178mg/L.

A test taken at the Waikouaiti water treatment plant (from the raw water reservoir) on 20 January came back nine days later showing 0.05mg/L (five times the acceptable level).

The Dunedin City Council was not specifically testing for lead at the time but was measuring the corrosivity of the supply's water and using metals as a proxy for that.

Upon receiving the 31 July test results in mid-August, the council alerted Public Health South and its independent drinking water assessor, and decided upon ongoing testing as the appropriate course of action without informing the public or elected representatives.

* Find all testing result data for lead in the area for the past six months here

The council says during the next 14 weeks, lead tested well below the acceptable limits, except for the result at the Waikouaiti Golf Club on 9 October 2020.

""This trend indicated that the result received on 13 August may have been an isolated incident at a localised point on the network,"" the council said.

Photo: RNZ / Tess Brunton

The concerning results of the 8 December test (showing almost 40 times the acceptable level) were emailed to a council staff member on 18 December, but they were not opened until the new year as the staff member was on leave at the time and did not check their emails.

The council says: ""When staff picked up the results on 7 January 2021, we notified the independent drinking water assessor. Again, the expert advice we received was that more sampling and investigation was required to determine the extent of the issue. Public Health South concluded that public notification was not yet required.

""The most recent sample to indicate high levels of lead was taken at the Waikouaiti raw water reservoir on 20 January 2021. We received this result on 29 January and again notified the independent drinking water assessor (contracted by the Ministry of Health).

""The result at the Waikouaiti raw water reservoir was the first time we had received results showing elevated lead levels at the water source.

""On 2 February 2021, we received advice from the Medical Officer of Health that all consumers on the water supply should be advised not to use tap water for drinking, cooking or preparing food until further notice. We acted on that advice immediately and put a range of measures in place to inform residents and provide safe drinking water.""

It is unclear what staff were involved in making these determinations as the chief executive was only informed on Monday this week of the problem.

Elected representatives had no role in decision making.

Mayor Aaron Hawkins was only told of the issue on the morning of Tuesday this week, councillors were only informed hours before the public was on Tuesday, and members of the Waikouaiti Coast Community Board found out about an hour before the matter was made public.

The Otago Regional Council told RNZ the Dunedin City Council ""first contacted us on 18 January 2021 about an increase in lead levels in one of their water samples"".

Both councils are now investigating the cause of the contamination but it is no clearer at present, despite several theories being floated among the public.

The council has not yet made public the concentrations of lead found in the other 84 tests carried out since August.

How much danger does the lead contamination of the water supply pose?

Authorities are currently saying the no-drinking notice, which was issued on Tuesday (186 days after lead was first detected in the supply), is a proactive and precautionary measure until the source and extent of contamination is determined.

A total of 18 samples (nine of the raw water reservoir and nine of the treated water reservoir) have been taken from the Waikouaiti Water Treatment Plant and only one, on 20 January 2021, has shown elevated lead levels.

Toxicologists have told RNZ throughout the week that concerns about lead poisoning comes with exposure over time, but individuals can respond differently to the highly poisonous heavy metal.

""It matters how long you've been exposed to this,"" Ian Shaw, a professor of Toxicology at Canterbury University, told RNZ today.

""If you're exposed to 40 times the drinking water standard in just a single dose it probably wouldn't cause too much of a problem. If you're exposed to that over several weeks you might get signs and symptoms of anaemia because lead will reduce the production of haemoglobin - the oxygen carrying pigment in the blood.

""But if you're exposed to that level over a very much longer period of time, this could lead to neurological damage and this is particularly worrying in kids because their nervous system, in particular their brain, is still developing. But the only way to be certain and know what the situation is - because people absorb lead differently and different people excrete it differently - is to take a blood sample and find out how much lead is in their blood and then you can deal with each individual case.""

The World Health Organization states ""There is no known 'safe' blood lead concentration"".

""As lead exposure increases, the range and severity of symptoms and effects also increases,"" it says.

To reassure locals, all Waikouaiti and Karitane residents are being invited to get blood tests done, starting from Tuesday next week.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield has endorsed this plan, and said the Ministry of Health had set up an incident management team.

The National Poisons Centre told RNZ this morning it has only received three calls about lead poisoning since the issue became public knowledge.

What happens next?

Public Health South is holding a public meeting at the East Otago Events Centre, 203 Main Road, Waikouaiti, at 7pm today, to discuss the drinking water issues.

Southern DHB Medical Officer of Health Dr Susan Jack, and medical toxicologist University of Otago and National Poisons Centre Director Dr Adam Pomerleau, will discuss:

The attempt on Friday was thwarted. The hackers remotely gained access to a software program, named TeamViewer, on the computer of an employee at the facility for the town of Oldsmar to gain control of other systems, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in an interview.

“The guy was sitting there monitoring the computer as he’s supposed to and all of a sudden he sees a window pop up that the computer has been accessed,” Gualtieri said. “The next thing you know someone is dragging the mouse and clicking around and opening programs and manipulating the system.”

The hackers then increased the amount of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, being distributed into the water supply. The chemical is typically used in small amounts to control the acidity of water, but at higher levels is dangerous to consume.

The plant employee alerted his employer, who called the sheriff. The water treatment facility was able to quickly reverse the command, leading to minimal impact.

Oldsmar Mayor Eric Seidel said in a press conference on Monday that the affected water treatment facility also had other controls in place that would have prevented a dangerous amount of lye from entering the water supply unnoticed.

“The amount of sodium hydroxide that got in was minimal and was reversed quickly,” Gualtieri said. The affected water treatment facility is a public utility owned by the town, he explained, which has its own internal IT team. Oldsmar is about 17 miles northwest of Tampa and has about 15,000 residents.

TeamViewer, which says on its website that its software has been installed on 2.5 billion devices worldwide, enables remote technical support among other applications.

The FBI and Secret Service have been called in to assist in an investigation. Gualtieri said he does not know who is responsible for the cyberattack.

“The important thing is to put everyone on notice,” he said. “This should be a wake-up call.”"

Sabra is recalling about 2,100 cases of its 10 oz Classic Hummus, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday.

The product was recalled after a routine FDA screening found Salmonella in one of the tubs of hummus. The FDA said the affected products are unlikely to be found in stores, as the hummus is already halfway through its shelf life.

The recalled tubs were produced on February 10 and have a ""Best Before"" date of April 26. To date, no food-borne illnesses or consumer complaints have been linked to the product, according to the FDA.

The hummus was distributed across 16 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, New Jersey, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

Salmonella is known to cause stomach cramps, fever, and diarrhea within 72 hours of eating contaminated food. Most Salmonella cases are mild and do not require medical treatment.

Sabra said that consumers with the contaminated product should return it to the company for a full refund.

This is not the first time Sabra has been forced to recall its hummus due to contamination fears. In 2016, the company recalled 57 varieties of its hummus for potential listeria contamination."

Consuming food contaminated with salmonella can result in salmonellosis. Common symptoms of this condition include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating a contaminated product. Most people recover without treatment. According to the Mayo Clinic, salmonella infection can cause dehydration, which for some can require hospitalization. But typically, people with salmonella do not exhibit any symptoms unless they have a weakened immune system.

""Salmonella infection usually isn't life-threatening,"" said the Mayo Clinic. ""However, in certain people — especially infants and young children, older adults, transplant recipients, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems — the development of complications can be dangerous.""

The 16 states where the hummus in question was distributed are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, New Jersey, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

Customers who purchased the specific recalled product should return it to the place of purchase or visit the Sabra recall website for more information.

ADVERTISEMENTClosed landfills over the limitThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency announced per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)contamination in groundwater at 59 closed landfills in 41 counties.
Fifteen closed landfills have PFAS contamination that exceeds state health-based guidance values by at least 10 times.","wells, state, landfills, water, pfas, mpca, legislature, drinking, groundwater, dozens, minnesota, landfill, linked, contamination",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"ST. PAUL — Nearly every shuttered landfill that state regulators monitor in Minnesota has leaked chemicals known as PFAS into groundwater sources, according to new findings released Thursday, March 18.

And more than half of those dumps have caused contamination at levels exceeding state safety guidelines, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Officials say that drinking water supplies across the state will have to be monitored for signs of the ""forever chemicals,"" which can be hazardous to human health, as a result.

""These closed landfills are throughout the state. They are in suburbs, Greater Minnesota, regional centers and small rural communities. They are next to our homes, our businesses and our farms,"" MPCA Commissioner Laura Bishop said during an online news conference Thursday. ""While the MPCA has addressed it where we have found it in a few drinking water wells, we also do not have that complete picture of the reach and impact of contamination.""

The MPCA has found perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — or PFAS — coming from sites belonging to its closed landfill program at a time when the consequences of their widespread use are coming more clearly into focus. The man made chemicals have been popular with manufacturers for decades and can be found in everything from nonstick cookware coating to fire-extinguishing foam.

But PFAS can leach away from products containing them after they are discarded and, because they do not decompose easily, linger or even recirculate throughout the environment. They turn up occasionally in human blood samples and have been linked to a host of health issues including hormonal imbalances, decreased fertility and cancer.

Officials say they have now been identified in groundwater sources near 98 of the 101 landfills recently tested by the MPCA. Fifty-nine of them — more than half of the 110 total landfills in the agency's monitoring program — were found to have caused contaminations in 41 counties at levels above what is considered safe to drink.

Another 15 were linked to contaminations of levels 15 times above the safety limit. In one extreme case, involving the Gofer Landfill outside of Fairmont, Minn., PFAS were found in groundwater sources at concentrations 1,300 times greater than the limit.

Though not every groundwater source sampled by the MPCA is used for drinking water, officials said, that doesn't rule out the possibility that more drinking water supplies have been impacted by PFAS than are presently known.

MPCA Assistant Commissioner Kirk Koudelka during Thursday's news conference pointed to the Northwoods Landfill near Ely, Minn., to illustrate that point. A water well near the dump that serves the neighboring transfer station was found to contain unsafe levels of PFAS, he said, but there are three other wells within a mile of the site that still need to be tested. (Workers at the station are being given bottled water to drink.)

""Northwoods is an example of about 60 sites that we have where we have not been able to sample all the nearby drinking water wells to determine if there are potential exposure pathways to residents of Minnesota,"" Koudelka said.

Created in 1994, MPCA's landfill program deals with inoperative dumps leaching contaminated liquids and gasses, most of which trafficked during their lifespans in a mix of municipal and industrial waste. Unlike comparable federal programs, which often require the private owners and operators of a contaminated site to pay for clean-up costs, it remedies problem landfills using a special fund backed mostly by Minnesota taxpayers.

Permission to tap into the fund, however, can be granted only by the Minnesota Legislature, whose approval the MPCA said it is now seeking. Koudelka said the agency does not have an estimate of what it could cost to tend to the landfills in question.

But remediation work, he said, could include the sampling of additional water wells, the collection and treatment of contaminated liquids known as leachate found leaking from the landfills, and the locating of new drinking water sources for those whose wells have been polluted. The work could vary considerably from dump to dump.

""It's important to note each of these landfills are unique, not only in their design and what might be in them, but also what is around them"" Koudelka said.

Bishop said Thursday that the MPCA will also ask the Legislature to be granted more flexible use of the landfill fund so it can respond more nimbly to ""any unexpected future incidents."" Without it, she said, ""the MPCA will be forced to wait until the legislature is in session and agrees to fund responses to urgent or emergency situations.""

""This existing structure really impedes our ability to act quickly and use discretion in addressing the most pressing needs of each site,"" she added. ""Minnesota families and communities should not have to wait until the legislature acts to release the funds.""

Whether the legislature would agree to such an arrangement is an open question. Members of environmental groups active in Minnesota and two state lawmakers, Reps. Rick Hansen, DFL-St. Paul, and Ami Wazlawik, DFL-White Bear Township, did voice support for it Thursday, however.

Hansen said the Legislature should look at ways to prevent PFAS from contaminating the environment, and at requiring polluting parties to chip in on clean-up costs. He likened the presence of undetected PFAS in nature to a ""sleeping giant.""

""And here we are in 2021, and the giant is waking up. And it's angry,"" he said.

The city is part of an ongoing investigation into PFAS contamination at the La Crosse Regional Airport on French Island.
The La Crosse Fire Department tested firefighting foam containing PFAS at burn pits on the site from the 1970s to the 1980s.
There have been mounting legal challenges over PFAS contamination as the dangers of the chemicals have become more widely known.
Environmental regulators are monitoring more than 50 sites with PFAS contamination across the state, including Marinette, Superior, Madison and Milwaukee.","wells, lawsuit, la, 23, city, water, pfas, health, files, calling, companies, crosse, contamination",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"The City of La Crosse claims products containing PFAS chemicals caused contamination of public and private wells in a lawsuit filed against nearly two dozen chemical companies on Thursday.

The suit filed by Milwaukee-based law firm Crueger Dickinson and firm Napoli Shkolnik in La Crosse County Circuit Court alleges that cities like La Crosse used aqueous firefighting foams (AFFF) that contained perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) for decades without any knowledge of the harmful effects the chemicals pose to public health. They say chemical manufacturers like 3M, DuPont and Tyco Fire Products knew of the risks associated with PFAS.

""Defendants were aware since the 1960s and 1970s that PFOA and PFOS were toxic, do not biodegrade, are persistent in the environment, move easily through soil and groundwater, and pose a significant risk to human health and health and safety; yet Defendants elected to manufacture and sell products utilizing these chemicals without warning their customers, placing profits over public health and safety,"" the complaint reads.

The lawsuit targets 23 companies that include 3M, DuPont and Chemours, as well as eight manufacturers of firefighting foams known to contain PFAS. PFAS chemicals have raised concerns because they don't break down easily in the environment. Studies have linked them to harmful health issues, including thyroid disease, reproductive health issues and kidney and testicular cancers.

The lawsuit is among thousands of legal challenges that have been filed across the country by local governments, citizens and firefighters due to PFAS contamination. Attorney Erin Dickinson, partner and co-owner of Crueger Dickinson, told WPR the lawsuit seeks to hold those companies responsible.

""The city has already incurred significant costs in trying to protect its residents in having to shut down wells and having to test and monitor wells for PFAS, in providing bottled water to affected residents,"" said Dickinson. ""But, it is also to ensure that the companies causing any of this contamination help pay for the solution and the cleanup on a going forward basis. And, obviously, that is just as important as the costs the city has already incurred and probably more so.""

The city is part of an ongoing investigation into PFAS contamination at the La Crosse Regional Airport on French Island. The investigation began after the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources flagged two city wells for the presence of PFAS last year, which are no longer being used. The La Crosse Fire Department tested firefighting foam containing PFAS at burn pits on the site from the 1970s to the 1980s.

The city hired an environmental consultant to conduct well and groundwater sampling that began in October 2020 within the Town of Campbell near the airport. More than one-third of wells tested last fall — 40 of 109 private wells — showed PFAS levels above the state's recommended groundwater standard of 20 parts per trillion.

The findings prompted the city council to authorize spending $25,000 for providing bottled water to nearly three dozen homeowners.

La Crosse Mayor Tim Kabat said the city has already incurred several hundred thousand dollars worth of costs related to the investigation. He said the lawsuit was a significant step toward holding companies accountable for PFAS pollution.

""We are taking this very seriously, and we've been working it seems like almost around the clock nonstop on this issue now for months. We've been following the science and following the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and our health advisors on our testing program — on providing bottled water to those private wells that exceed the 20 parts per trillion recommended standard,"" he said.

The La Crosse Regional Airport is currently required to store firefighting foam containing PFAS as part of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. City officials have said that would only be used in emergencies. The FAA is required to come up with an alternative to PFAS-containing foam by October of this year.

Attorney Tim Jacobson with the law firm Fitzpatrick, Skemp and Butler has served legal notices to the city to preserve the right of around 225 residents in the Town of Campbell to file a lawsuit against La Crosse for PFAS contamination. He thinks it’s appropriate for the city to sue those chemical companies, but he added the lawsuit was not filed to benefit the Town of Campbell.

""It doesn’t change the dynamic in terms of the relief that our clients on French Island will be seeking,"" said Jacobson.

He said residents want to see a permanent supply of clean drinking water in addition to compensation for health issues related to PFAS exposure and a decline in their property values. La Crosse's mayor said city officials hope a settlement would help bring a permanent source of safe drinking water for island residents.

Yet, Jacobson said PFAS pollution on French Island is a devastating situation and urged public officials to step up and start addressing these chemicals.

The Wisconsin DNR had crafted an emergency rule to enforce restrictions as part of a bill signed into law last year that bans the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS except in emergencies and other limited circumstances. But, Republican lawmakers weakened that rule and the agency’s ability to regulate treatment of such foam.

The city is among more than 100 local governments that have filed lawsuits against chemical companies over their ties to PFAS contamination.

The firms who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the city were also a part of the $17.5 million class action settlement with Tyco Fire Products and two other companies over widespread PFAS contamination stemming from the use of firefighting foam in the Peshtigo and Marinette areas.

The multi-million dollar settlement reached with Tyco, Chemguard and ChemDesign will compensate Peshtigo residents for exposure to PFAS in private drinking water wells, property damage and individual disease claims due to the use of firefighting foams.

There have been mounting legal challenges over PFAS contamination as the dangers of the chemicals have become more widely known. In 2018, Minnesota settled its lawsuit against 3M for $850 million. In 2017, Dupont resolved a lawsuit in West Virginia for $671 million over PFAS contamination that has been detailed in the film ""Dark Waters.""

When wells are affected by PFAS, damages can range up to $10 million per well, according to Paul Napoli, the city's co-lead counsel. He added that the cost to remediate the airport and surrounding property could be tens of millions, if not up to $100 million.

""More and more cities and airports and water providers are finding this to be a problem as state governments and the federal government start to identify the uses around the country and develop regulations,"" said Napoli.

However, no state or federal standards currently exist for the chemicals. Last year, the state Department of Health Services recommended a combined groundwater standard of 20 parts per trillion for two of the most common PFAS chemicals: PFOA and PFOS. State health officials expanded that recommendation to include four additional PFAS substances in November. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS.

Environmental regulators are monitoring more than 50 sites with PFAS contamination across the state, including Marinette, Superior, Madison and Milwaukee. The sites include military installations, industrial areas and waterways."

Some landowners still living with contamination face water insecurity and health concerns The Department of Defence says there is no way to completely remove PFAS from aquifers, but it is trialling new technologies

Katherine landowners Kristy and Anthony Bartlett live near RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory and were lead plaintiffs in the landmark class action suing the Australian government for allowing toxic PFAS chemicals to escape defence bases and contaminate soil and groundwater in surrounding communities.

The chemicals were used in firefighting foams at Australian defence bases until the early 2000s and are now ubiquitous in the Bartlett family's groundwater and bloodstream.

""It has been good to have some acknowledgement and compensation, but it's not the end of the road,"" Ms Bartlett said.

""We're still concerned about our health, our children's health more so, and we're still concerned about the fact that we live on a property that has contamination.""

Divided health views

The communities of Katherine in the Northern Territory, Oakey in Queensland and Williamtown in New South Wales received a $212.5 million settlement for property value loss, and distress and vexation.

Shine Lawyers' class actions leader Joshua Aylward said the federal government was yet to face a class action for health impacts caused by PFAS exposure because the link to various diseases was undetermined.

""As time goes by and more research and funding goes towards understanding the link between exposure and disease, legal action becomes more of a possibility,"" Mr Aylward said.

PFAS — or Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — is the broad name for 4,700 chemicals that do not break down and instead accumulate in soil, water and human bodies.

Peter John Spafford was Katherine's GP for a decade and became increasingly convinced PFAS exposure was affecting the public health of his town. ( ABC News: Jon Daly )

The Australian Health Department said the latest evidence suggested exposure was linked with mildly elevated levels of cholesterol, effects on kidney function, and the levels of some hormones.

""However, these effects are small and generally within ranges seen in the general population,"" a spokesperson said.

""PFAS has not been shown to cause disease in humans.""

That view differs from other international health agencies, such as the European Environment Agency, which has ""high certainty"" of other links to liver damage, kidney and testicular cancer.

Class action member Peter John Spafford worked as Katherine's GP for a decade and is convinced PFAS has had some influence on the health of his patients.

""There is evidence to say there potentially are problems, there's this continuing playing down of the impact of PFAS, of which we don't know what the long-term consequences are,"" Dr Spafford said.

""I don't believe we're being told the truth here because it's a government problem, so it's not a problem.""

A federally funded epidemiological study on residents in Katherine, Oakey and Williamtown by the Australian National University is expected to be published mid-2021.

Tainted land and water

While the class action has ended, affected communities are still grappling with the challenges of living in contamination.

Dianne Priddle was once reliant on groundwater at her multi-million-dollar cattle property near Oakey in southern Queensland.

When contamination was discovered, she was forced to stop irrigating pasture crops and send cattle to agistment at a business cost never recognised by the courts, according to Ms Priddle.

""What we got out of it we spent in 2019 in the drought to stay afloat,"" she said.

She questioned her prospects of a fair sale price in the future saying ""no producer would want to buy into anything like this"".

""This is a lifetime sentence,"" Ms Priddle said.

In Katherine, the Department of Defence built rainwater tanks to replace groundwater bores on rural properties.

Katherine landowner Anthony Bartlett is concerned about his water supply as the end of a contingent supply contract with the Department of Defence approaches. ( ABC News: Jon Daly )

The Bartlett family signed a contract with the Department of Defence, which requires it to refill tanks for several years if wet season rainfall is not enough.

Top-ups were required after well-below-average wet season rainfall in 2018 and 2019, and with the contract set to lapse at the end of 2022, Mr Bartlett is concerned about future water security.

""The bottom line is they were responsible and still are responsible for the contamination of not only our block, our neighbours' blocks and all of Katherine, so they should've maintained that contract,"" Mr Bartlett said.

Department of Defence deputy secretary for estate and infrastructure Steve Grzeskowiak said his department would consider its options closer to the end of the contracts.

""We'll take a view on how we might ensure we don't leave people in a situation where their water supply is not sustainable,"" Mr Grzeskowiak said.

The chemicals were used in firefighting foams at Australian defence bases until the early 2000s and are now ubiquitous in the groundwater of surrounding communities. ( ABC News: Jon Daly )

The continuing clean-up

Defence is continuing to clean up contamination sites at Katherine, Oakey and Williamtown by filtering water and pumping it back into aquifers and removing contaminated soil.

Mr Grzeskowiak said his department was also trialling new technologies at Williamtown and a defence base in South Australia.

But removing the contamination from the groundwater entirely was unrealistic, according to Mr Grzeskowiak.

""There wouldn't be any mechanism, globally, that would confidently be able to extract PFAS from an underground aquifer where the PFAS has spread over a vast area at very low quantities,"" he said.

For Ms Bartlett, the lengths taken to address the contamination and compensate affected communities were insufficient and trust lost for the federal government was as permanent as PFAS.

""We don't look to them for any hope,"" Ms Bartlett said.

""You do realise you're just a little pawn out in the backwaters of Australia and your life doesn't really count for much in the big scheme of things."""

Others gathered in front of a Days Inn to do the same.

It marked the beginning of a drinking water advisory issued by the Wisconsin DNR Thursday, after all but one of 185 private wells tested were found to have varying levels of PFAS contamination.

PFAS is a family of hundreds of manmade chemicals that for decades have been used in many products. Often described as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS don’t break down in the environment and can accumulate in humans, fish and other wildlife.

Campbell is located on French Island, which is home to the La Crosse Regional Airport. Firefighting foam containing PFAS has been used there, over time.

DNR environmental management administrator Darsi Foss explained.

“Testing, training and emergency response use of that foam has resulted in soil and groundwater contamination,” said Foss. “Preliminary information suggests that PFAS concentrations exceed the DHS recommended groundwater standards in 61 of these private wells.”

Foss called water distribution the first step, “to ultimately identify the sources of PFAS on the island and to take actions to provide permanent water and the clean-up of soil and groundwater contamination.”

Thursday evening, more than 200 people tuned in to a community information session via YouTube.

While French Island residents could not ask questions directly, Office of Emerging Contaminants policy director Mimi Johnson promised more wells will be sampled.

In the meantime, she says all of the approximately 1,200 private well owners on the island qualify for emergency water.

“We’ll continue to work to sample private wells to determine the extent of PFAS contamination. The interim advisory makes all residents with private wells eligible for water from the DNR. Wells do not need to be sampled in order to establish eligibility,” said Johnson.

The DNR set up a PFAS hotline for French Island. A public meeting during which residents can ask questions is planned for mid-April.

But earlier Thursday, remediation and redevelopment program director Christine Haag cautioned the DNR can’t promise quick permanent solutions.

“I can say from our experience in Marinette, there’s not quick solution to this, it’s complicated,” said Haag.

Listen: PFAS Contamination Wider Than Thought In Marinette Well Water

The DNR has been working to tackle massive PFAS contamination in Marinette, and in the neighboring Town of Peshtigo, found in soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water, private drinking water wells and biosolids.

Haag met with Marinette and Peshtigo residents for the first time nearly two years ago.

Company Announcement

MG Foods of Charlotte, NC is expanding its recall issued March 10, 2021 to include three Turkey Wraps due to potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short- term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, a Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

The products were distributed between March 3, 2021 and March 5, 2021 and packaged in clear plastic wedges & plastic wrap. The products were sold exclusively via vending machines and micro markets located in business locations in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia. The company reacted swiftly and as of end-of-day March 5, 2021 affected products were removed from sale at all locations.

No illnesses have been reported to date.

Deprivatization debate

Privatization of local waste and recycling services has become increasingly common in recent decades. This month, two municipalities with populations of a little over 20,000 each took key steps toward bucking the trend.

Almost 15 years into a 20-year arrangement with Waste Connections, the city of Port Angeles, Washington, moved to cancel its contract at a March 16 council meeting. As soon as this fall, the city plans to take over operations of its transfer station, residential recycling collection routes, and other services – as well as negotiate new post-collection arrangements for processing and disposal.

This will mean filling 12 new full-time equivalent positions and possibly spending as much as $2.5 million on new equipment in the first year. Beyond these upfront costs, elected officials and staff described it as a way to ensure long-term rate stability for residents.

“I think it’s becoming more and more difficult for third parties to compete when their labor costs are typically the same as ours and we don’t have a markup,” said Thomas Hunter, director of public works and utilities, adding the city can take this on because it already has administrative infrastructure as a full-service utility provider.

Relations with the company have been fraught, with Waste Connections suing Port Angeles for $4.8 million over disputes about rate increases and other issues last year. Hunter said that litigation is in mediation and is separate from this decision. Waste Connections did not respond to a request for comment.

This week, Simpsonville, South Carolina, also took an initial step toward bringing waste collection service back under the city’s purview despite receiving offers to continue outsourcing. A current five-year contract with ACE Environmental was arranged in part to help handle equipment issues outside of the city’s budget, and one city council member said “it was always our hope” that it would be short-term. Now, staff say they’ve built up the necessary funds to buy four new collection vehicles and start hiring collection workers this summer.

While the industry has many well-known examples of public sector or quasi-governmental entities operating waste infrastructure, the list got much shorter when sources were asked about recent additions.

Last spring, Kansas City, Missouri, made the notable change of taking over residential collection service citywide, after choosing not to renew contracts, for a projected savings of $20 million over 10 years. The city couldn’t be reached for a progress report.

In the wake of escalating recycling processing charges, local entities in at least five states have explored the feasibility of investing in their own processing infrastructure – according to a November presentation from Kessler Consulting for the Northeast Recycling Council. The idea of taking over some private services was also recently raised in San Francisco amid increasing pressure on the city’s statutory monopoly, but no near-term changes are expected.

On Thursday, following a turbulent relationship, Waste Pro announced plans to pull out of a Memphis, Tennessee, collection contract, saying “it has been our experience that City staff and other groups do prefer waste collection to be a government responsibility, not a private company’s.” Mayor Jim Strickland told The Daily Memphian he was surprised by the move and didn’t comment on whether city crews might take over affected areas in the future.

Still, these specific instances remain the exception to the norm in large part because of the common argument that private sector operations can be more cost-effective and efficient. While that may be the case at times, Port Angeles believes there’s more to it.

“Sometimes it’s politically easier to contract some of these things out... It sets your future for the next 5, 10, 15 years and kind of reduces the workload on continuing to strive for efficiency,” said Hunter. “Just because we’re a municipality doesn’t mean that we can’t be flexible, it doesn’t mean that we can’t act swiftly. It just means that we have to work a little bit harder than everybody else to do it.

Contamination meets tech

How can residents recycle more effectively and, well, correctly? That question continues to challenge communities in 2021, with curbside contamination an ongoing and common woe.

The Recycling Partnership is helping drive a trend of meeting people where they are, especially if that’s on a smartphone or through social media. In Fort Worth, Texas, and Atlanta, TRP recently began piloting a real-time informational tool that’s integrated for users of Facebook and Instagram. Through the Communities for Recycling program, residents can message questions about if or how certain categories of items can be recycled in their location.

“The launch of Communities for Recycling is a foundation for what is likely to become a new national standard for hyper-local recycling education and contamination reduction efforts,” Kanika Greenlee, Atlanta’s environmental programs director, said in a statement. TRP expects to expand the tool to other communities and also launch a national database with accurate recycling information.

Meanwhile, Nashville, Tennessee, has its own new waste and recycling app with personalized trash and recycling collection calendars for metro curbside customers, trash and recycling pick-up day reminders, and – in the same vein as the TRP program – a “Waste Wizard” search tool for information on over 200 materials. The app, accessible to Android and iOS device users, received some grant funding from the Tennessee Department of Transportation.

In Carrabus County, North Carolina, and its neighboring cities of Concord and Kannapolis, officials are also making a new push for residents to use the locally developed CARTology app introduced in 2018. About one out of every four items placed in local recycling carts are contaminants, according to WBTV News.

Recycle Coach, a Toronto-based software company that makes a similar tool to educate and engage residents, also came up in a recent U.S. EPA webinar on reducing contamination in residential recycling. New Jersey was the first to purchase the tool for statewide use, according to earlier comments from Erin Jensen of the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. Louisville, Kentucky, also adopted the use of Recycle Coach in 2021.

Amid the push to engage people through technology, some of the most widely used anti-contamination efforts remain in-person. Washington, D.C. this week, in conjunction with TRP, kicked off an 8-week “Feet on the Street” campaign in which it aims to inspect carts on 16 recycling routes and post “Oops” tags when residents left non-recyclable items. A similar effort in 2018 reportedly slashed plastic bag and film contamination by 20% in D.C.’s waste stream. Tucson, Arizona, began its own version of the program this month as well.

Still, an important factor to keep in mind with these efforts is that different curbside recyclers have varying commitments to recycling, per a report released this week by the Solid Waste Association of North America. “Recycling and sustainability program managers often overestimate the commitment of certain residents, and mistakenly assume that contamination issues can be resolved through increased spending on recycling public education programs,” the report states.

More updates from around the country (and the world)

Shreveport, Louisiana: Last year it became one of the largest cities in the country to end curbside recycling service, for complex and opaque reasons , and Shreveport’s first RFP attempt got no responses. Now, the city is assessing four responses from a second round and hopes to have a plan in the coming months. ( KEEL )

Long Beach, California: Cities have seen heightened issues with managing illegal dumping in recent months, but new federal funding may provide some relief. Following an infusion of federal money, Long Beach will dedicate $5 million to a new cleanup initiative. ( Long Beach Post )

Ann Arbor, Michigan: Reducing transportation emissions may be a key element of climate change mitigation, but an idea to start collecting waste every other week encountered the hard realities of constituent expectations after local council members quickly distanced themselves from the proposal. ( MLive )

Sioux Falls, South Dakota: In the latest sign of early pandemic changes fading into history, the state’s largest city recently repealed an ordinance requiring residents to put their garbage containers on the curb (rather than an “inconspicuous place"" on the property) to help with reduced staffing. ( Argus Leader )

Westminster, U.K.: To cut down on traffic and noise, this London borough is eyeing a system with three to five commercial waste companies selected through competitive bidding. The inspiration? New York City’s delayed commercial waste zone system .

Dos and don’ts

Recycling may be known for its uniquely local guidelines, but certain tips have universal resonance.

In a message service providers around the country would agree with, Adams Sanitation is asking residents of Santa Rosa County, Florida, to stop putting live ammunition in their carts. A company representative told the Pensacola News Journal a local manager “sent me pictures of 12-gauge shotgun shells, rifle rounds, it was wild.”

Meanwhile, last week, Phoenix highlighted advice for balancing water conservation with contamination guidelines on the national stage. In response to a question during a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on plastics, Public Works Director Ginger Spencer shared this regional tip.

“In Phoenix, we are very concerned about water use,” she said. “I'll use a yogurt cup as an example. Instead of rinsing it out with water, what we would encourage you to do is just leave it out on your counter, let it dry up, and you can crunch the cup and scoop out the food waste. Now it's clean and you can put it in your recycling bin.”

The SFA has directed several importers to recall these eggs, which have the farm code ""CES008"" on them, after discovering the presence of Salmonella enteritidis (SE), which may cause illness if food is consumed raw or undercooked.

Malaysian authorities said on Sunday (March 14) that they are monitoring the situation.

The importers are Ang Seng Eggs Supplier, Dasoon, Heng Guan Food Industrial and Lam Leng Trading.

""The farm is also suspended and SFA will lift the suspension only when the farm has rectified the SE contamination issue,"" the agency said in a statement.

The bacteria can be present inside the egg as well as on its shell, and the SFA advised those who have already purchased these eggs to cook them thoroughly before consumption, as heat destroys the bacteria.

SE can survive in raw and undercooked eggs and may cause foodborne illness, noted the agency. Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting.

Said the agency: ""While we cannot tell if eggs are contaminated just by looking at it, we can reduce the risk of SE infection by ensuring that eggs are cooked thoroughly until the egg white and yolk are solid, and practising proper hygienic practices to prevent cross-contamination with other food"".

It warned that while SE infection typically subsides within a week in most people, it can cause serious infection in vulnerable groups such as the elderly, young children and those with weakened immune systems."

Mercury pollution from power plants and mining operations can end up in our air and water.

But it’s tricky to predict just how much of that environmental mercury will make its way into our food—and our bodies.

“We were working on developing a bioindicator, a biosentinel, that could inform us of the levels of mercury contamination across the U.S.”

Ecologist Collin Eagles-Smith of the United States Geological Survey. He and his colleagues came up with a practical way to determine the scope of mercury contamination in an ecosystem by measuring mercury levels in a single species. Their bioindicator: juvenile dragonflies, or larvae. Dragonfly larvae stay underwater, don’t move much, are easy to collect and live long enough to accumulate significant amounts of mercury.

“If you have enough locations sampled with dragonflies, you can develop an index of the relative amount of mercury in the biological community.”

The team measured mercury concentrations in thousands of dragonfly larvae collected from waterways in 100 national parks during a 10-year period. And to amass the large sample number, they recruited volunteers through the Dragonfly Mercury Project.

The volunteers used dip nets to collect dragonfly larvae from their aquatic abodes. National park staff then sent the larvae to laboratories for processing. For comparison, the researchers also measured mercury concentrations in other aquatic organisms.

“Using the relationships between dragonfly concentrations and fish concentrations, we were able to develop what we call an impairment index.”

That index allowed the researchers to make health risk predictions at each sample site.

“About 12 percent of the locations posed what we consider to be high or severe risk of health impairments to fish, wildlife or humans if they consumed organisms from those locations. You can begin to build models that are predictive of how much mercury might be in a system and then apply that model to locations where you haven’t sampled dragonflies.

“And that can inform future management actions either to address the factors that are promoting the mercury production or simply to inform agencies that may want to evaluate whether or not fish consumption advisories are warranted.”

The study is in the journal of Environmental Science & Technology. [Collin A. Eagles-Smith et al., A national-scale assessment of mercury bioaccumulation in United States national parks using dragonfly larvae as biosentinels through a citizen-science framework]

The development of targeted therapies based either on small molecules or monoclonal antibodies opened ground for rapid evolution and a large diversification in the clinical landscape. Recent market reports suggest an increase in niche products, making dedicated facilities less practical, which may lead to more outsourcing of drug production to contract manufacturing organisations with experience in handling different products in shared facilities can be an option.

How cross-contamination can be avoided

Following recalled contaminated products such as Cholestyramine Resin in 1998, the industry moved on from using “visibly clean” as a sole acceptance criterion, moving towards quantifiable criteria such as the 0.001 dose criterion, or the 3 or 10 ppm values. Although these dose-based values were widely accepted by the industry, none of these values made their way into official regulatory guidance documents. FDA always expected a scientifically justifiable basis for the establishment of limits.

This movement towards science-based limits began with the ISPE Risk-MaPP Baseline Guide with the definition of the Acceptable Daily Exposure. This is a conservative approach to define a daily dose of a substance, below which no adverse events are anticipated, even if exposure occurs for a lifetime. The EMA converted this idea into the first official guideline and established the Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE).

Baxter’s facility: setting a safety precedent

At Baxter’s oncology contract manufacturing facility in Halle, Germany, guidance to help prevent cross-contamination has been fully developed to allow manufacturers to assess risk and determine where control strategies are necessary to meet acceptable limits for cross-contamination. With over 60 years of oncology experience, patient safety and world-class manufacturing continue to be a top priority.

At Baxter’s oncology facility, risk assessment is combined with state-of-the-art organisational procedures and technical standards in accordance with current industry guidance. The goal is to help ensure the greatest possible reduction of different modes of potential cross-contamination

This means that Baxter’s oncology facility is capable of handling cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic small molecules, both in liposomal and nanoparticulate formulations, as well as monoclonal antibodies, ADCs and nucleic acid products.

With the advent of more product niches and often lowered production quantities, facilities that are experienced and versatile in handling cytotoxic, highly potent and non-cytotoxic oncology products can present a valid option when considering outsourcing. Risks for cross-contamination must be properly assessed, using state-of-the-art organisation procedures, technical standards and current industry guidance. As is the case in all areas of drug development, patient safety is the manufacturers key priority.

Third, contamination can add unintended materials, such as heavy metals to devices.Given the wide range of potential extractables, the high number of cell lines used in research, and the complex workflows in cell culture, tracking all of the potential problems proves nearly impossible.
With these standards a manufacturer can test plastic labware and packaging for extractables.","potential, plastic, plasticware, devices, cell, low, used, labware, minimizing, manufacturer, extractables, additives, culture, usp, contamination",contamination,Man-Made Disaster,"All laboratory plasticware contains extractables. These are the compounds in polymers and resins that, under certain conditions, might migrate into anything that contacts the plastic. Extractables can end up in cell-culture media, serum, additives or buffers stored in plasticware. As a result, cells in culture come in contact with many sources of extractables, from filters and flasks to pipettes and multi-well plates, and that interaction could impact the cells.



Keeping track of the extractables that cells encounter is complicated. The same polymer can contain different additives depending on the manufacturer, which changes the potential extractables. The impact of extractables on a cell culture depends on the cell line and how the plasticware is used. Exposing a plastic to a solvent or high temperature can change the quantity of extractables that may leach into solution, for example.



Even when manufacturers test laboratory plasticware for extractables in line with best practices, that data will not cover every possible application. The safety and appropriateness of plasticware for individual cell-culture experiments is a joint responsibility of manufacturers and the scientists using the devices.

Extractables in plasticware generally come from three sources. First, a resin manufacturer adds additives to enhance the performance of the plastic such as to improve its rigidity, clarity, chemical resistance or temperature compatibility, for example. These additives come from more than 40,000 common compounds. Second, the plasticware manufacturer uses another set of additives such as slip agents to add in manufacturing. Third, contamination can add unintended materials, such as heavy metals to devices.Given the wide range of potential extractables, the high number of cell lines used in research, and the complex workflows in cell culture, tracking all of the potential problems proves nearly impossible. Consequently, there is currently no wide-ranging study of the impact of extractables on cell lines.Research can reveal known dangers such asThe broad array ofhe United States Pharmacopeia (USP) provides testing methods for extractables. The primary standards are USP <661> for plastics and USP <665> for packaging. With these standards a manufacturer can test plastic labware and packaging for extractables. The resulting data consists of a list of the compounds and their relative concentrations.laboratory must test how the labware will respond to being used in specific applications. An extractable’s impact on a culture depends on the cell line, the length of exposure and the conditions, such as pH or temperature. The exposure is also cumulative as cells or media, and other materials, encounter multiple different surfaces during culturing.It is important for scientists to review the general toxicity data provided by the manufacturer and consult the available literature for data on specific applications of plasticware. If that information fails to cover a laboratory’s plasticware and application needs, the team of scientists working on the particular cell culture can perform their own testing.Reliable plasticware for cell culture should ideally meet USP Class VI, which is a plastics designation from General Chapter <88> of the USP and National Formulary. This standard is a general indicator of toxicity of the plasticware including its extractables.High-quality plasticware is typically made from virgin resins which reduces uncertainty in the composition. It is also important that manufacturers carefully monitor extractables, maintain knowledge of potentially problematic ones, minimize the use of additives where possible, impose change-control in plasticware, and run rigorous testing procedures. Meeting these standards comes with costs and so lower-cost plasticware is likely not going to be subject to the same level of quality or control.All plastics contain extractables. This applies to labware as well. For the best protection against extractables damaging cells in culture, knowledge gives scientist an edge—knowledge of the approach taken during manufacture, knowledge of how the plasticware has been tested for extractables before arriving at the laboratory and knowledge of how it is being used by peers around the world.Scientists who stay updated on the potential extractables in labware, and the possible impacts, are better positioned to minimize the odds of cell-culture contamination. To make the best decision a scientist can talk with manufacturers and other scientists before picking plasticware for their cell-culture projects."
