The findings open the potential for developing effective treatments and designing a vaccine for dengue and similar diseases.

Dengue virus, a member of a group of viruses called flaviviruses, causes 50 to 100 million cases of dengue disease each year, with no effective treatment or vaccine. Other members of this group include the viruses that cause Zika, yellow fever and West Nile fever.

In a new study scheduled to publish Jan. 8 in the journal Science, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan revealed how an antibody called 2B7 neutralizes one specific protein made by the virus—a protein that is key to the dengue virus’s ability to both replicate and cause disease.

The protein, called NS1 (short for “non-structural protein 1”) circulates in the patient’s blood and exacerbates disease by interacting directly with endothelial cells, the cells that form protective barriers around organs. By breaking apart the connections between endothelial cells, NS1 weakens this barrier, increasing permeability and contributing to increased vascular leak, which is the hallmark of severe dengue disease. This endothelial permeability may also enable the virus to more easily cross barriers to infect and damage target organs.

The authors and other researchers had previously demonstrated that this protein itself can cause leaks in the endothelial barrier, even in the absence of infectious viral particles. And in cases of dengue virus infection, the more NS1 found circulating in the host’s blood, the more severe the infection is likely to be.

“We think of bacterial toxins, but this idea of a viral toxin is a new concept,” said Eva Harris, a professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health and one of the study’s senior authors. “This is really an important protein in terms of creating new paradigms regarding how we think about viral proteins and their functions in disease.”

In this latest study, the researchers identified specific regions of the protein that are responsible for damaging the endothelial cells: a so-called wing region that allows the protein to connect to the host cells, and another region that triggers destructive events within the endothelial cells.

By analyzing the precise way that the 2B7 antibody attaches to the protein, they found that the antibody is able to neutralize both of these regions—simply by getting in the protein’s way. The antibody connects to NS1 in such a way that the wing regions cannot reach the endothelial cells, preventing the protein from latching onto (and thus interacting with and damaging) the endothelial cells.

“This collaborative approach gives us a lot of great insight into understanding the biology of this protein, its interactions with cells and its pathogenesis,” said David Akey, a researcher at the U-M Life Sciences Institute and a lead author of the study. “It’s an example of combining structure and function to open therapeutic avenues.”

One reason no effective therapeutic has been found for dengue is that the disease can be caused by one of four different virus strains (dengue virus 1, 2, 3 or 4). Having antibodies against one strain of the virus can actually increase severity of a subsequent infection from another strain, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement.

By binding only to the NS1 protein and not to the virus particle itself, however, the 2B7 antibody does not lead to antibody-dependent enhancement of the infection.

“These findings tell us that we can really have an effect on the virus’s pathogenesis by blocking these sites on just the circulating proteins,” said Janet Smith, a professor at the U-M Life Sciences Institute and U-M Medical School. “It offers a strategy not only for a therapy to treat an infection, but also for a vaccine to prevent infection.”

And because the NS1 protein is produced by many flaviviruses, the scientists believe the antibody that targets NS1 may be useful in treating or preventing multiple flaviviruses.

“We were able to show not only the mechanism of how the antibody protects the host cells, but also the actual mechanism of pathogenesis of this protein that is conserved across other flaviviruses,” Harris said.

“I think the fact that this antibody is cross-reactive with other flavivirus NS1 proteins is one of the most exciting elements of this work,” said Scott Biering, a postdoctoral researcher in Harris’s lab and a lead author of the study. “This research is the proof of concept that you can target this one protein for multiple flaviviruses to protect against pathogenesis. It opens a lot of avenues not only for better understanding the mechanics of this virus, but also for developing effective therapeutics.”

The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.

VIENTIANE, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 people died from dengue fever across Laos in 2020, according to a report from the Lao Ministry of Health.

According to the latest report from the Center of Information and Education for Health under the Lao Ministry of Health, Lao capital Vientiane recorded the highest number of dengue patients at 1,912, representing over 23 percent of infections in the country.

The 13 deaths included four in Vientiane, two each in Bolikhamxay and Khammuan, and one each in Xayaboury, Xieng Khuang, Savannakhet, Phongsaly, and Oudomxay.

The Lao Ministry of Health advised that every family should drain water that collects in jars, vases and dishes, and should cover such containers to prevent more water from filling them up.

If people fall ill, they should suspect that dengue may be the cause of their illness and get a blood test at a hospital, according to the report.

According to the World Health Organization, dengue fever is one of the fastest emerging infections, with Thailand, Laos, the Philippines and Singapore also seeing high incidences. The number of cases in the Western Pacific Region has more than doubled over the past 10 years. Enditem"

The Aedes mosquito population rose by about 8 per cent in December, said NEA.

In addition, two less common dengue serotypes - DENV-3 and DENV-4 - now make up more than half of the infections.

A total of 156 dengue cases were reported last week, which is less than half of the 343 cases recorded in the same period last year.

DENGUE IN 2020



Last year’s dengue outbreak was “historic”, with a total of 35,315 cases reported, said NEA in its review of the situation in 2020.

The agency noted that the number of weekly cases rose sharply in May, shortly after the start of the COVID-19 circuit breaker period and eventually peaked in July.

In response, NEA conducted an ""intensive two-week islandwide exercise"" in July with the town councils to fight dengue, noting that the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd intensified audits of its member sites after circuit breaker measures were eased.

Last year, NEA conducted about 1 million inspections islandwide to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats. These included about 7,400 checks at construction sites, said the agency, adding that about 23,400 mosquito breeding habitats were uncovered.

About 430 summonses and 37 stop work orders were issued to construction sites, and 27 contractors were charged in court for repeat offences, NEA said.

As for homes, since the implementation of heavier penalties on Jul 15, NEA said it detected multiple mosquito breeding in 346 of the residential premises inspected, and repeated mosquito breeding in about 330 of homes inspected.



POSSIBLE RISE IN DENGUE STRAINS THIS YEAR

While DENV-2 remains the predominant dengue virus serotype in Singapore, there has been an increase in the proportion of cases and clusters involving the DENV-3 and DENV-4 strains over the past month, said NEA.

""As Singapore has not seen a DENV-3 outbreak in the three decades before 2020, and has not seen a large recorded outbreak of DENV-4, the population immunity for DENV-3 and DENV-4 is low, and more people are susceptible to transmission of the virus,"" said NEA.



""It is thus critical that all residents and stakeholders work closely together with NEA to break dengue transmission in these clusters, and curtail the spread of the virus.""



As of Jan 22, among the five largest dengue clusters, DENV-3 was detected in the cluster at Jalan Gembira/Jalan Mesra, and DENV-4 was detected in the clusters at Bedok North Street 3 and Gangsa Road.



Ahead of Chinese New Year, when homes and other places may be decorated with more ornamental plants, NEA said all stakeholders should keep an eye out for mosquito breeding sites.

“Homeowners doing spring cleaning are reminded to properly dispose of any refuse, including large furniture or household items, to avoid the discarded materials from becoming unintentional mosquito breeding habitats,” NEA said.

The agency added that is has completed inspections of all plant nurseries, and has distributed advisories and pamphlets to all nursery operators on preventing mosquito breeding.

Still, viruses don’t wait in line for their turn, and the dengue virus infects between 50–100 million people per year. Developing effective therapeutics or vaccines is the key to thwarting this disease and alleviating the suffering of those afflicted. Thankfully, a team of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan has discovered an antibody that blocks the spread within the body of the dengue virus.

Findings from the new study were published recently in Science through an article titled, “Structural basis for antibody inhibition of flavivirus NS1–triggered endothelial dysfunction.”

Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for the dengue virus. Since there are four different strains of the virus, building up antibodies against one strain can actually leave people more vulnerable to subsequent infection from another strain, which makes finding an effective therapeutic more difficult. Scientists using the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility located at the DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory, have reported success.

“Protein structures determined at the APS have played a critical role in the development of drugs and vaccines for several diseases, and these new results are key to the development of a potentially effective treatment against flaviviruses,” noted Bob Fischetti, PhD, a group leader with Argonne’s X-ray sciences division and life sciences advisor to the APS director.

The dengue virus uses a particular protein, called Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), to latch onto the protective cells around organs. It weakens the protective barrier, allowing the virus to infect the cell, and may cause the rupture of blood vessels. The research team’s antibody, called 2B7, physically blocks the NS1 protein, preventing it from attaching itself to cells and slowing the virus’s spread. Moreover, because it attacks the protein directly and not the virus particle itself, 2B7 is effective against all four dengue virus strains.

The research team used X-ray diffraction techniques to determine structures of the NS1 protein with a bound antibody (2B7) and showed how the antibody provides protection against the virus. These diffraction images were obtained at the General Medical Sciences and Cancer Institutes Structural Biology Facility (GM/CA) at the APS.

“We presented three crystal structures of full-length dengue virus NS1 complexed with a flavivirus–cross-reactive, NS1-specific monoclonal antibody, 2B7, at resolutions between 2.89 and 3.96 angstroms,” the authors wrote. “These structures revealed a protective mechanism by which two domains of NS1 are antagonized simultaneously. The NS1 wing domain mediates cell binding, whereas the β-ladder triggers downstream events, both of which are required for dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus NS1–mediated endothelial dysfunction.”

“Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people a year, and tens of thousands die from the associated diseases,” Fischetti added.

The researchers showed that the 2B7 antibody effectively blocks the spread of the dengue virus in live mice. Their findings suggest that this same antibody could provide new treatments for other flaviviruses like dengue, a group that includes Zika and West Nile.

“These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for 2B7 protection against NS1-induced pathology and demonstrate the potential of one antibody to treat infections by multiple flaviviruses,” the authors concluded."

In 2013, Singapore reported the largest dengue fever outbreak in recent history recording some 22,318 cases and eight deaths.

However, that record was easily shattered in 2020 as Singapore officials report that as of Dec. 17, 2020, 34,844 dengue cases were reported.

The year started with high weekly dengue cases of between 300 – 400, and the relative dominance of the more unusual dengue virus serotype (DENV-3) in the first four months of the year. Weekly cases rose sharply in May 2020 and eventually peaked in July 2020 with 1792 cases in a week.

Why the dengue fever surge in 2020?

The National Environment Agency (NEA) listed a number of factors:

First, an increase in the less common Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) since the beginning of this year. This serotype is uncommon in Singapore, which means that there is low immunity in our population. This contributed to the unusually high number of weekly cases.

Second, there has been an increase in the population of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, since 2019, as revealed by NEA’s Gravitrap surveillance system.

While the two factors were driving the dengue situation in the first quarter of the year, signaling an imminent large dengue outbreak, the situation was exacerbated by the COVID-19 situation and the measures against COVID-19. Our analysis estimated 50 per cent more dengue infections during the Circuit Breaker period, compared to what we would expect for that period in 2020.





Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are day-biters and harbor within the indoor environment. The work-from-home arrangement to allow social distancing has led to most people working from naturally ventilated homes, rather than offices, shops and factories. This increased the probability of contact between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and humans, and would have contributed to the increase in dengue cases.

At the same time, the mosquito population continued to rise in the middle of the year. The impact of the suspension of construction sites is seen in the three-fold increase in the proportion of mosquito breeding found in construction sites from April to June, compared to from January to March.

At home, more mosquito breeding was also found, perhaps due to the challenges faced by residents in juggling working from home, higher housekeeping load, and home schooling of children.

Other factors at play during the Circuit Breaker period could also have compounded the dengue situation. These include the reduction in some landscaping works due to manpower shortages, and cessation of the bulk of construction activities, which would have hampered good housekeeping at construction sites.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan 15 2021 (IPS) - While the world is grappling with the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru is still dealing with an epidemic that it has not been able to control---the mosquito-borne viral disease known as dengue.

With almost 56,400 confirmed cases as of December, Peru is suffering the worst dengue epidemic since 2017, when the virus infected over 68,000 people. The illness, coupled with the novel coronavirus crisis, has left thousands of people exposed to malnutrition and water-borne diseases.

Although mortality rates are low for dengue cases, nutritious diets and immediate sanitary responses are needed to battle the condition. And, above all, prevention is key to handling future epidemics, given that the mosquito responsible for dengue, Aedes aegypti, is expanding to new territories in Peru. As informal settlements and urbanization increase, so do Aedes larvae, which grow in stagnant water accumulated in cans or pots.

""Dengue has become endemic to many regions in Peru whereas before it was mostly found in the tropical ecosystem areas,"" says a researcher for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Washington DC, pointing at the regions of Madre de Dios, Loreto, Ucayali, and San Martin, among others. ""It's normal to find dengue near the Amazon, but now we can find it in desert-type areas. It should be easier to control dengue, but it's difficult to control urbanization.""

The epidemic

The Peru dengue crisis began in October of 2019 when the cases increased in the Madre de Dios region in the country's southeast. The government soon sent the armed forces to fumigate people's houses and kill the larvae while issuing recommendations to avoid the virus.

As a result, the spread of the virus slowed down in November, with the Minister of Health Elizabeth Hinostroza saying that dengue cases in Madre de Dios had decreased by 30%, as reported by local outlets.

But the respite was short-lived. In February, the government declared dengue a health emergency, ramping up the resources dedicated to fighting off the virus. By the time the coronavirus pandemic hit Peru, dengue had spread to 17 regions, including Junin and Ica.

Still, the country lacked the resources to face a pandemic and an epidemic simultaneously.

Protests broke out in early March in the region of Loreto, northeast Peru, due to a lack of medical attention to those infected. With air-borne COVID-19 assailing the country and mandatory lockdowns in place, fumigations became difficult if not impossible to conduct. Besides, some of the coronavirus symptoms, like headaches, were similar to those generated by dengue.

In October of 2020, Peru raised the alarm again by ""reinforcing the sanitary response to dengue's control and prevention [...]."" By the end of the year, the COVID-19 pandemic had left almost 38,400 casualties, high unemployment levels, and a growing informal economy. (The underground economy may have increased from 70% to 80% or 90% since the pandemic hit Peru, say local outlets.)

In the background, dengue kept spreading.

On December 9, The National Center of Epidemiology, Prevention, and Disease Control, tied to the Ministry of Health, sent out an alert, warning that Peru was the third country in the Americas region with the highest mortality rate due to dengue. The Dominican Republic and Venezuela came in first.

But what does dengue do?

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease, widespread through the tropics as it is ""influenced by rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and unplanned rapid urbanization,"" explains the World Health Organization (WHO). The species Aedes aegypti is also the vector for other viruses such as chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika.

As climate changes and urbanization increases, the mosquito is finding new places to hatch. ""If new areas get warmer, the vector Aedes will expand,"" explains the PAHO researcher to IPS. ""We can now find it in higher altitudes than before.""

The consequences of the disease vary, notes the WHO in a note on June 23, 2020. The symptoms may range from those similar to the flu to ""severe bleedings, organ impairment and/or plasma leakage."" In either case, the virus can also affect women and anemics disproportionately.

""Dengue impacts on an individual's iron levels, which can be especially crucial for pregnant women,"" says Angel Muñoz, climate variability researcher at the International Research Institute, which is part of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. ""Anemics are more likely to get the disease.""

Malnutrition

Dengue patients usually experience high levels of dehydration and lack of nutrients, so the intake of water and nutrients is essential.

Recommended diets are rich in vegetables with vitamin A, C, and K, such as spinach and beetroot, fruits with the latter two vitamins, such as citrus, and nuts with proteins.

However, in Peru access to clean water can be tricky in certain regions and marginal areas, where stagnant water abounds. For instance, in the region of Loreto, only 45.4% of the population consumed drinking water through the public infrastructure in 2019, notes the country's National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) in a 2020 report.

This lack of access to drinking water heightens the impact of dengue and results in other malnutrition problems. The Food Sustainability Index, developed by the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition and the Economist Intelligence Unit, notes ""poor sanitation and a lack of clean water contribute to malnutrition resulting from diarrhea."" In contrast, the index says that ""improved sanitation and better water services also help tackle world hunger.""

On top of these infrastructural problems, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns in its latest report that malnutrition increased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, deepening the pervasiveness of dengue. ""During the last five years, the situation has worsened with an increase of 13.2 million people with undernutrition,"" says the FAO.

How to prevent dengue

Prevention is essential to control dengue, both through forecasts and awareness campaigns conducted by public institutions.

Research has shown a relationship between climate patterns and the mosquito's life cycle, as explained in the paper AeDES: a next-generation monitoring and forecasting system for environmental suitability of Aedes-borne disease transmission, authored by Muñoz and other researchers.

""There's a relationship between environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall and humidity, and the mosquito's life cycle,"" he explains to IPS. ""It is possible to do reliable climate forecasts and predict the likelihood of the disease spreading.""

As a result of the paper, the team at IRI has designed a tool to monitor and forecast Aedes-borne environmental suitability, which could be used by policymakers to predict the potential impact of dengue.

However, predicting dengue's probability is not enough, as the information must reach the population. Muñoz notes that awareness campaigns are essential to ensuring the public knows how the disease spreads. ""Recipients with stagnant water or large landfills create the perfect habitat for the mosquito.""

Through the Ministry of Health, the Peruvian government has launched awareness campaigns in the past, its latest being ""Dengue kills. Kill the mosquito!""

This campaign emphasized getting rid of breeding grounds for the species, both through preventive measures and fumigation. Some of its recommendations include:

But fumigations and awareness campaigns require vast amounts of resources. While the regions have exclusive budgets to fight mosquito-borne diseases, in the past months a portion of that money has been used to face the pandemic, report Jorge Carrillo and Alicia Tovar for Peru's investigative outlet Ojo Público.

As a result, populations with less access to information, healthcare, and lower socioeconomic conditions remain more at risk because they are more likely to preserve cans or planters to conserve water.

""We need tools to understand the impact of environmental factors on dengue's seasonality. If we have a detailed system of who could be more at risk and where and when dengue could spread, we could reinforce prevention strategies,"" concludes Muñoz."

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of the virus that can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN 2, DEN 3, DEN 4).

Dengue Fever (DF) – marked by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and pain in muscles and joints. Some may also have a rash and varying degree of bleeding from various parts of the body (including nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising).Dengue has a wide spectrum of infection outcome (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Symptomatic illness can vary from dengue fever (DF) to the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) – is a more severe form, seen only in a small proportion of those infected. DHF is a stereotypic illness characterized by 3 phases; febrile phase with high continuous fever usually lasting for less than 7 days; critical phase (plasma leaking) lasting 1-2 days usually apparent when fever comes down, leading to shock if not detected and treated early; convalescence phase lasting 2-5 days with improvement of appetite, bradycardia (slow heart rate), convalescent rash (white patches in red background), often accompanied by generalized itching (more intense in palms and soles), and diuresis (increase urine output).

Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) — Shock syndrome is a dangerous complication of dengue infection and is associated with high mortality. Severe dengue occurs as a result of secondary infection with a different virus serotype. Increased vascular permeability, together with myocardial dysfunction and dehydration, contribute to the development of shock, with resultant multiorgan failure."

A senior medical officer of health is urging Barbadians to know the symptoms of dengue fever as well as the warning signs for severe dengue, the potentially fatal state of the mosquito-borne illness.

In an interview with the Barbados Government Information Service, Dr Leslie Rollock, who is responsible for infectious diseases, environmental matters and surveillance in the Ministry of Health and Wellness explained that dengue fever is caused by any one of four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes or strains. She said each DENV strain could produce mild to severe illness.

According to research, persons with healthy immune systems can only get each strain once.

“Dengue infection, regardless of the type, is indistinguishable. It may be asymptomatic, which means the person has no symptoms. But if it is symptomatic, most people would experience in the initial phase high fever; headache; pain, especially behind the eyes and on movement of the eyes; joint pains; skin rash, either all over the body or just over the joints; and upset stomach, which could lead to vomiting or diarrhoea,” she outlined, adding that symptoms usually lasted two to seven days.

If individuals continued to deteriorate after that, Rollock said, it was critical to look for the warning signs of severe dengue. Although less than one per cent of people with severe dengue will die, she emphasised that early detection and access to proper supportive medical care could save lives.

“They get abdominal pain; if they had vomiting, it gets worse, and they may notice that their gums are bleeding. Their appetite may not return and they may get evidence that fluid is collecting in areas of the body, those are signs to go to your doctor and for your doctor to take note of for admission, because the warning signs may predict severe disease,” she explained.

The senior medical officer of health added that while anyone could get severe dengue, children and young persons were usually most affected during an outbreak.

“Even though a person may get the severe disease, they may not die if they are managed through that period, which is 24 to 48 hours in a hospital,” she said.

People with severe dengue may experience dehydration and excessive bleeding, for which they would need urgent clinical care. (BGIS)"

A year has passed since the coronavirus outbreak spread from Wuhan in China to Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Yet, we are still in a ferocious battle with the deadly pandemic. As COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in some parts of the world, a number of countries have reported new waves and have resorted to fresh lockdowns.

New coronavirus variants have been identified in Britain and South Africa – which are said to be even more contagious – and spreading fast. At the time of writing, over 101 million people have been infected with the deadly virus and more than two million have succumbed to it.

However, amid the current health crisis, another disease that has long haunted the people of Southeast Asia is still infecting people and continuing to claim more lives. Dengue, is unfortunately, not uncommon in the region. In 2019 to 2020, a dengue fever epidemic hit several countries in Asia which included the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand, Pakistan, and Lao PDR.

An estimated 390 million infections of dengue occur every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States (US) said that 40 percent of the world’s population live in areas at risk of dengue, including those of us in ASEAN member states.

As of December 2020, in Cambodia, a total of 10,464 dengue cases with 15 deaths were reported. In Malaysia, during the 48th week of 2020 alone, a total of 824 dengue cases were reported, bringing the cumulative number of reported cases by the end of November to a whopping 86,406 cases. Despite the high number of dengue cases, the numbers actually reveal a decrease in infections compared to the same period in 2019 when nearly 120,000 cases were reported.

Other ASEAN member states such as Singapore, Lao PDR, and Vietnam also reported dengue infections in 2020.

The mosquito-borne viral disease is transmitted to humans through the bites of female mosquitoes, mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. Aedes mosquitoes are identified by the black and white stripes on their bodies. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), these mosquitoes are vectors of chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Severe dengue can cause bleeding that leads to organ impairment or plasma leakage and eventual death.

Most At Risk Of Dengue

Singapore-based consumer information provider, ValueChampion conducted a study across 12 countries in Southeast Asia and found that the Philippines is the nation most at risk from dengue in the region. In 2019, the Philippines Department of Health declared a national dengue epidemic after 271,480 dengue cases were reported between January and August, 2019. By November 2019, more than 400,000 people were infected with the virus with over 1,000 deaths recorded. Local media in the country dubbed it the worst dengue outbreak since 2012.

Data from the WHO stated that the Philippines reported 76,432 dengue cases and 299 deaths from 1 January to 14 November, 2020.

Indonesia is the second ASEAN member state most at risk of catching the disease after the Philippines. At least 110,000 cases of dengue were recorded in 2019 in the country, mostly affecting those in Java, Bali and Sumatra, according to the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers (IAMAT).

The archipelago, which has the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the region at more than one million cases has also struggled with dengue fever in 2020. In the first six months of 2020, Indonesia reported about 68,000 cases of the mosquito-borne viral infection, with at least 349 fatal cases, said Siti Nadia Tarmizi, director of vector-transmission and zoonotic disease prevention and control at Indonesia’s Ministry of Health.

""As of June...we can still see 100 to 500 cases of dengue fever a day,"" Tarmizi explained at a press conference in Jakarta last year. ""We don't know why there has been something different this year.""

Lao PDR ranks fifth among countries at risk of dengue, according to the ValueChampion study, and third among ASEAN member states. The IAMAT discovered that the dengue epidemic in Lao peaks during warmer and wetter months, typically from May to October, every year.

Other ASEAN member states such as Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore were also in ValueChampion’s top 10 list of nations most at risk of contracting the disease.

According to the WHO, despite the numbers reported, ""a vast majority of cases are asymptomatic and hence the actual number of dengue cases go underreported and many cases are misclassified."" Typical symptoms of dengue include nausea, vomiting, rashes and joint pains – whereas a severe attack of dengue could cause someone to bleed from the nose and gums.

Dengue-carrying mosquitoes breed in clean, stagnant water typically found in homes. The best solution to prevent the reproduction of aedes mosquitoes and the subsequent spread of dengue fever is by frequently checking and removing stagnant water in premises.

MANILA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - According to one rumour circulating in the Philippines, the coronavirus vaccine will allow President Rodrigo Duterte to kill people at the push of a button.

She said she was afraid of the novel coronavirus but even more afraid of vaccination.

The Philippines is due to start immunisations next month despite suffering Southeast Asia's second-worst outbreak of the coronavirus with more than half a million infections and over 10,000 deaths.

But officials acknowledge they have an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take it, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with a precarious health system in the Southeast Asian archipelago.

""Messaging has to be very concrete and evidence based to encourage people to receive the vaccines,"" Health Ministry under-secretary Rosario Vergeire told Reuters.

""We are assuring Filipinos that whatever vaccines that will be brought in and provided will go through a stringent process of regulation.""

DENGVAXIA SCARE

Confidence in vaccines was knocked by controversy over French company Sanofi's Dengvaxia.

Rolled out rapidly in 2016 to more than 800,000 children to protect them from dengue - it was banned after its maker said it could worsen the disease in people who had not previously been exposed to the infection.

That led to two congressional enquiries and more than 100 criminal cases that linked child deaths to the anti-dengue shot - though such links have never been proved.

Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective and the vaccine has been approved for use by the United States and European Union.

After that episode, the Philippines fell from one of the top 10 countries for confidence in vaccines to no higher than 70th place. The number of children who were fully vaccinated fell from 85% in 2010 to 69% in 2019.

To address the fears, health workers would hold town hall and online meetings and be given special training on how to answer questions, said Carlito Galvez, a former army general running the anti-COVID-19 campaign, told the Senate.

The aim is to inoculate 70 million adults this year.

'BIG PROBLEM'

In parts of the southern Philippines, the big fear is of a state-sponsored death campaign - not completely far-fetched in a country where Duterte's drug war has left nearly 6,000 thousand dead since he took office in 2016.

Remote southern regions are the scene of both communist and Islamist insurgencies.

""Some of the information shared on Facebook and text messages said the COVID-19 vaccine contained a microchip which can be controlled remotely by President Duterte, and once he pushes a button, the person who received the vaccine will die,"" said Nasser Alimoda, a government doctor in Lanao del Sur province.

Everywhere, there is concern over the specific vaccines that the Philippines plans to use too - particularly over Chinese company Sinovac Biotech's vaccine, for which one study showed effectiveness of little over 50%, though another gave it over 91%.

One opinion poll showed fewer than a third of Filipinos were willing to get inoculated against coronavirus.

""Vaccination programmes will go to waste if people refuse to get the shots,"" a former health minister, Esperanza Cabral, told Reuters.

Apasrah Mapupuno, the head of the government's Lanao del Sur health team, said she had asked dozens of health workers and others if they would roll up their sleeves for a COVID-19 vaccines.

Not one said 'yes'.

""That is the big problem,"" Mapupuno said. ""How can the health workers convince the community to get vaccinated if they themselves are not sold on COVID-19 vaccines?""

The next step will be human trials to test the efficacy of the extract on the dengue virus, and the protocols have been written in conjunction with Otago University.

The first extracts from the leaves of the fruit grown at a Northland research orchard are now part of a clinical study at universities in the UK and in Asia.

The project is spearheaded by Queenstown based company Fuller Young International.

Managing director Raymond Young said research and development within New Zealand has been supported by Crown institutes, Plant and Food Research and Auckland based Callaghan Innovation.

Young said papaya had long been used in traditional herbal remedies in tropical areas for illnesses associated with the mosquito related virus, plus general age related illnesses.

But the genesis was a request from his Singapore-based daughter who was concerned about the risks to her children from the dengue virus.

""She'd heard that papaya extract worked against the dengue virus and we thought, 'maybe we should try some ourselves', and that's led us to five or six years down the track to actually growing it, and extracting compounds that show in the early clinical studies to overcome the virus.""

Young said no one really knew what was in the leaf that made it an effective treatment for the dengue virus, so they set about looking into extracts of leaf and how to make it more efficient.

Young said once they found out what it was, they began looking at methods of manufacturing, but soon discovered papaya was hard to obtain.

""Although it's grown in many places, to get it in reasonable quantities was hard, so we set about trying to grow our own papaya in Japan.""

Young had family connections in the country.

""After a five-year investment in that we had our own papaya variety and we worked to see if it would grow in northern New Zealand.""

After talking with Plant and Food Research, the company grew its first variety called Wakatengu, which was planted out in the spring and fruit and leaves harvested before winter.

The 1ha plantation holds about 700 trees, similar in scale to the operation in Japan, but where the winters were much colder and the summers hotter. The use of high-potency organic fertiliser, mainly chicken manure, had yielded good results, Young said.

""It was very successful. We adjusted the growing method and got the same result.

Photo: Supplied / Raymond Young

""We harvested the leaf and, working with Callaghan, we worked on extracting the active ingredient.""

Young said it was interesting that the compounds believed to be beneficial in treating the dengue virus were more potent in the leaves of the crop grown in New Zealand than that grown in Japan.

Young said a papaya plant grew for about seven years in tropical conditions, but in New Zealand were planted annually as winters here - and in Japan - killed the plants.

""We re-plant early in the spring and harvest before winter. We did start initially growing just for the leaves but we're now working on green papaya because we've discovered the some enzymes in the green fruit are very good for helping to fight some cancers and certain viruses.

""We've just sent the first 100 kilos from Japan into Callaghan. We've processed it and the strength of the enzymes are now being tested.""

Young said work was to begin shortly at a New Zealand university, to test the proteins and how they worked on certain cancers and viruses.

He said the project had attracted the government's attention, but it missed out on the Provincial Growth Fund in the previous term of government.

The next step will be human trials to test the efficacy of the extract on the dengue virus, and the protocols have been written in conjunction with Otago University.

""We don't have a set date for when that will take place, however we've been encouraged to produce a supplement in Malaysia to put on the market. We're now going through the regulatory process for that.""

Young said the potential return per hectare of papaya grown for its extracts could be three times greater than kiwifruit."

Extremely low temperature, however, will ensure that mosquito-breeding remains low, the official added.“While the overall number of mosquito-borne diseases remained comparatively lower in 2020 than previous years, the data captured by sentinel hospitals was affected this year due to many of these hospitals being turned into Covid hospitals,” said sources.The 36 sentinel hospitals include all major government hospitals and some private hospitals. The list includes hospitals like LNJP, Hindu Rao, AIIMS, RML, Safdarjung, Babu Jagjivan Ram among others.A recent analysis of mosquito-breeding data showed that peri-domestic containers accounted for largest chunk of ‘mosquito-breeding sites cases’ followed by domestic water storage containers.

Ed Krishna Alivio, disease surveillance officer of the City Health Office, said the current count was three times the nine cases recorded during the same period last year.

Alivio said the increase was due to the prevailing weather that brought scattered to heavy rainfall and left stagnant pools of water where dengue-carrying mosquitoes bred.

But Dr Nisperos and other medics worry the Duterte administration might be repeating Aquino’s mistakes.
But experts say the “lack of transparency” over the procurement of Sinovac vaccine will make the government’s task of fighting the pandemic even more difficult.
“It will really erode the whole confidence on the vaccine forever, if we shortcut the processes now,” Dr Medina said.","covid, trials, philippines, public, vaccine, vaccination, sinovac, dutertes, controversy, health, nisperos, roll, haunts, dengvaxia, dr, pandemic",dengue,idiosyncratic,"Dr Gene Nisperos is an assistant professor at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Medicine in the country’s capital, Manila. As a medical frontliner, he is on the priority list for vaccination against the coronavirus when the government releases its promised first vaccines next month.

But Dr Nisperos has grave doubts about President Rodrigo Duterte’s plan.

The medic is particularly critical of the government’s decision to disallow Filipinos from choosing the type of coronavirus vaccine they receive. The government has said it will buy millions of doses from China’s Sinovac despite the absence of “reliable data” and incomplete clinical trials.

These sorts of issues will only discourage people from getting vaccinated, he says.





“The people with vaccine hesitancy are health workers themselves,” Dr Nisperos said.

“If you cannot convince your health personnel regarding the vaccination programme, then how are you going to convince ordinary citizens?”

Many Filipinos have not forgotten the botched launch of the anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia in 2016 under Duterte’s predecessor Benigno Aquino III.

The vaccine was touted as key to tackling the deadly mosquito-borne disease that is prevalent in many cities in Southeast Asia. But after less than two years of being introduced in the Philippines, it was abruptly suspended due to worries about serious adverse effects. The controversy has been partly blamed for the dramatic decline in Filipinos’ support for vaccination – from as high as 90 percent in 2015 to a low of 60 percent just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

The Philippines is banking on vaccinations to help it escape a pandemic that has killed more than 10,000 people across the archipelago and forced cities and towns into prolonged lockdowns. The pandemic has been blamed for the 9.5 percent drop of its gross domestic product or GDP in 2020 – the worst economic slump since the post-war period.

But Dr Nisperos and other medics worry the Duterte administration might be repeating Aquino’s mistakes.

Dr Harold Henrison Chiu, an endocrinology specialist at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila says he will only consider being jabbed with the Sinovac vaccine if all the data is made public, including the cost, given the “inconsistent” and sub-par results of the medication’s clinical trials in other countries. He says Filipinos should be able to choose which vaccine they receive.

“Our citizens deserve the safest, most efficacious and cost-effective choice out there.”

It's too easy to criticize a man when he's out of favor, and to make him shoulder the blame for everybody else's mistakes. We have seen cracks at the vaccination plan , lack of transparency on the pricing and turtle paced procurement of vaccines. We deserve to know. https://t.co/f1z7OA3q9f — Tony Leachon MD (@DrTonyLeachon) January 24, 2021

Sinovac deal

So far, the Philippine government has granted emergency approval to the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca which are both already in use elsewhere in the world.

However, Pfizer-BioNTech has yet to sign a contract with the Philippines, while AstraZeneca, which secured approval on Thursday, has committed 30 million doses to the country, although the actual delivery date has not been confirmed.

But the country’s deal with Sinovac has proved more controversial with the public.

While the Chinese company has yet to complete third-stage clinical trials for the vaccine – a requirement for the application for emergency-use authorisation (EUA) – Manila has already signed a contract with Beijing to secure 25 million doses.

Some 50,000 shots are due to arrive in Manila by next month, even before EUA approval has been given.

The government has refused to reveal how much it paid for the vaccine, citing Sinovac’s non-disclosure clause.

Without the green light from Filipino regulators, Dr Paolo Medina a primary health care physician says he will not consider taking the Sinovac vaccine, and will instead wait for other options.

“But if the emergency use authorisation comes out and the process is transparent enough, as a health professional, I will consider it given the urgency of the pandemic,” said Dr Medina, who teaches community medicine at the University of the Philippines.

Growing scepticism

Concerns raised by health professionals mirror the Filipino public’s increasingly sceptical views.

A December 2020 survey conducted by OCTA Research, which analyses Philippine health statistics, found that only 25 percent of respondents in Metro Manila were willing to get an anti-COVID shot.

Some 28 percent of the people surveyed said they would refuse any type of vaccine, while 47 percent were undecided and said it depended on the brands available.

A separate survey conducted between November and December by the Manila-based public opinion pollster, Pulse Asia, meanwhile, showed that only 32 percent of Filipinos nationwide wanted to get vaccinated against the coronavirus and 47 percent said they did not want to get vaccinated at all due to safety concerns.





Betraying the public

The situation is a sharp reversal from earlier years. As recently as 2015, about nine out of 10 Filipinos said they believed in the importance of vaccines, according to the Global Vaccine Confidence Index.

The hesitancy can be traced back to the controversy surrounding Dengvaxia, which was administered to schoolchildren beginning in 2016.

“Many of the safeguards that were in place for the longest time were violated, and were intentionally not followed, in order to push for a vaccine that was still in research level,” Dr Nisperos, of the University of the Philippines, said of the effort to approve Dengvaxia.

“The entire vaccination programme was conducted under very dubious, and non-medical conditions that put children’s lives at stake. The Department of Health betrayed people’s trust.”

For 19 months beginning in April 2016, more than 800,000 schoolchildren from pilot areas in Metro Manila and five provinces received shots of the world’s first dengue vaccine, which had been developed by the French pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur.

But in December 2017, the programme was abruptly suspended by the Duterte administration, after a follow-up study by Sanofi found that the vaccine posed a greater risk to people who had not previously been infected by the virus.

It mirrored a World Health Organization (WHO) warning, which Filipino health officials failed to heed before the vaccination programme was launched. WHO had found that Dengvaxia “may be ineffective, or may even increase that risk” on those who had not yet been infected at the time of the first vaccination.





Acting in haste

The deaths of several pre-teen students, who received the vaccine, further raised alarm, with blanket news coverage and partisan political statements raising fear and public anger.

Experts from the Philippine General Hospital later found that three of the children died of “dengue shock syndrome”, of which two were “possibly caused by vaccine failure.” But no conclusive findings were reached. Sanofi-Pasteur also says its vaccine remains safe, and has been given regulatory approval for use, under some restrictions, by the US and the European Union.

A separate investigation by the Philippine Congress concluded that Aquino administration officials acted in haste in approving the vaccine.

Although the vaccination had completed the three trials required by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration, it went ahead despite unfinished clinical trials from the country’s own medical researchers, which was the recommended practice to ensure safety and efficacy.





The Philippines is now battling with one of Southeast Asia’s biggest coronavirus outbreaks and is eager to find a way out of a pandemic that has forced the prolonged lockdown of many parts of the country, including Manila.

But experts say the “lack of transparency” over the procurement of Sinovac vaccine will make the government’s task of fighting the pandemic even more difficult.

“How can you influence a lot of people to use Sinovac, when you have not yet reviewed the regulatory documents?” Dr Tony Leachon, a former senior adviser to the Duterte government’s COVID-19 response team, told Al Jazeera.

Leachon notes that none of the mayors from the Philippines’ major cities has expressed their willingness to buy the Chinese-made drug.

“What are you going to do with the Sinovac vaccine if the residents of the local government will not actually accept it for their use,” Dr Leachon said.

If the government would still insist on pushing for the Sinovac shot in the priority list, then it should “show leadership” by inoculating cabinet officials and influential personalities first, he said.

After initially declaring last year that he was willing to be vaccinated in public using a vaccine from Russia, Duterte has since sidestepped the question. Earlier this week, his spokesman said that the president will do it in private, because he wants to be injected in the buttock.

In Indonesia, which took part in late-stage trials for Sinovac, President Joko Widodo was the first to receive the shot. It has now been rolled out across Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. Trials have shown widely varying efficacy rates from only 50 percent in Brazil to 65 percent in Indonesia and a high of 91 percent in Turkey.

No accountability?

Dr Medina, the community medicine professor from the University of the Philippines, says that aside from transparency, it is equally important for the government to have accountability if it wants to ensure public faith in its vaccination programme.

He says the recent controversy over the vaccination of Duterte’s security detail using smuggled vaccines from China, only served to further erode people’s trust in the process.

“The fact that there is no accountability conveys a message that we are not serious.”

Dr Medina says that the government must set an example by following all the necessary procedures.

“It will really erode the whole confidence on the vaccine forever, if we shortcut the processes now,” Dr Medina said.

Duterte has long relied on the military to lead his administration’s coronavirus response.

But with public confidence waning, and the need to convince a sceptical public of the need for vaccination, some say the president needs to put scientists and public health experts rather than generals at the front of the campaign.

“Once we do that, we can use a better lens to decide a national action plan against COVID-19″ based on science,” said Dr Nisperos, who also leads Second Opinion PH, an alternative voice in public health.

“The militarist pandemic response has proven itself to be useless and counterproductive.”"

In January 2021, only 15 dengue cases were reported with no deaths.

2005 was the previous low in a January when 67 cases were reported.

The month of January had less rain than normal in the city of Rio is also pointed out as an important factor, because it ends up generating less standing water, where the female of the Aedes mosquito deposits its larvae.

“Although we can celebrate these small victories, such as the smallest number of cases and no deaths in recent years, we need to pay attention to the fact that, although we are experiencing a new pandemic, dengue has not ceased to exist. Care to combat the disease must still be carried out. If today there is this partial victory, there is certainly a significant contribution from learning and practice in combat and prevention, not only by the government, but also by the population of Rio. This cannot be ignored, especially if our goal is to eradicate it in the near future ”, highlight the specialists from the Rio 21 Institute.

While it is early in 2021, the two countries reporting the most dengue fever to date in southeast Asia are Vietnam and the Philippines.

In Vietnam, a total of 11,659 cases of dengue without any deaths have been reported through February 14. While high, it is down some 23 percent from last year at this time when 15,089 cases were reported.

The Philippines is also one of the countries reporting high number of cases globally to date. As of 6 February 2021, 6,614 dengue cases have been reported in 2021, including 20 deaths (CFR 0.3%). The number of cases in this period is 77% lower compared to the 29,184 cases reported in the same period in 2020.

Dengue is a disease caused by a virus spread through mosquito bites. The disease can take up to 2 weeks to develop with illness generally lasting less than a week.

Health effects from dengue include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash, muscle and joint pain, and minor bleeding.

Dengue can become severe within a few hours. Severe dengue is a medical emergency, usually requiring hospitalization.

In severe cases, health effects can include hemorrhage (uncontrolled bleeding), shock (seriously low blood pressure), organ failure, and death."

In addition, testing for infecting serotype and monitoring platelet count and serum albumin, AST, and ALT concentrations during the febrile phase of illness could improve the early prediction of severe dengue.

Of 6643 studies identified, 150 articles were included in the systematic review, and 122 articles comprising 25 potential predictors were included in the meta-analyses. Female patients had a higher risk of severe dengue than male patients in the main analysis (2674 [16·2%] of 16 481 vs 3052 [10·5%] of 29 142; odds ratio [OR] 1·13 [95% CI 1·01–1·26) but not in the subgroup analysis of studies with children. Pre-existing comorbidities associated with severe disease were diabetes (135 [31·3%] of 431 with vs 868 [16·0%] of 5421 without; crude OR 4·38 [2·58–7·43]), hypertension (240 [35·0%] of 685 vs 763 [20·6%] of 3695; 2·19 [1·36–3·53]), renal disease (44 [45·8%] of 96 vs 271 [16·0%] of 1690; 4·67 [2·21–9·88]), and cardiovascular disease (nine [23·1%] of 39 vs 155 [8·6%] of 1793; 2·79 [1·04–7·50]). Clinical features during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease were vomiting (329 [13·5%] of 2432 with vs 258 [6·8%] of 3797 without; 2·25 [1·87–2·71]), abdominal pain and tenderness (321 [17·7%] of 1814 vs 435 [8·1%] of 5357; 1·92 [1·35–2·74]), spontaneous or mucosal bleeding (147 [17·9%] of 822 vs 676 [10·8%] of 6235; 1·57 [1·13–2·19]), and the presence of clinical fluid accumulation (40 [42·1%] of 95 vs 212 [14·9%] of 1425; 4·61 [2·29–9·26]). During the first 4 days of illness, platelet count was lower (standardised mean difference −0·34 [95% CI −0·54 to −0·15]), serum albumin was lower (−0·5 [–0·86 to −0·15]), and aminotransferase concentrations were higher (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 1·06 [0·54 to 1·57] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 0·73 [0·36 to 1·09]) among individuals who progressed to severe disease. Dengue virus serotype 2 was associated with severe disease in children. Secondary infections (vs primary infections) were also associated with severe disease (1682 [11·8%] of 14 252 with vs 507 [5·2%] of 9660 without; OR 2·26 [95% CI 1·65–3·09]). Although the included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias in terms of study confounding, the risk of bias was low to moderate in other domains. Heterogeneity of the pooled results varied from low to high on different factors.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors identifiable during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease defined according to WHO criteria. Eight medical databases were searched for studies published from Jan 1, 1997, to Jan 31, 2020. Original clinical studies in English assessing the association of factors detected during the febrile phase with progression to severe dengue were selected and assessed by three reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models to estimate pooled effect sizes. Only predictors reported in at least four studies were included in the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I 2 statistics, and publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. We did subgroup analyses of studies with children and adults. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018093363.

The ability to accurately predict early progression of dengue to severe disease is crucial for patient triage and clinical management. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found significant heterogeneity in predictors of severe disease due to large variation in these factors during the time course of the illness. We aimed to identify factors associated with progression to severe dengue disease that are detectable specifically in the febrile phase.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify early predictors in the disease time course that are associated with progression to severe dengue disease. The results of this analysis could provide insight into early prognostic factors associated with severe disease progression and support the optimisation of patient triage to improve quality of care.

Although hundreds of clinical studies have been done to identify factors associated with the early onset of plasma leakage, most have included a small number of patients, and overall their results remain inconclusive. To address this issue, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been done.These studies have found high heterogeneity in the clinical factors associated with disease progression, most likely due to considerable variation in the clinical time course considered in the studies. As a result, early clinical factors (ie, those occurring during the febrile phase) associated with disease progression have yet to be defined.

To assist clinicians in the early detection of severe disease progression, a Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, in collaboration with WHO, recommended the use of warning signs detailed in the 2009 WHO dengue guidelineas early indicators of plasma leakage. These warning signs are abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, liver enlargement by more than 2 cm, and an increase in haematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count. Although the use of these warning signs achieves high sensitivity in detecting those at risk of disease progression during the febrile phase, it substantially increases the number of unnecessary admissions, particularly in endemic areas and during epidemics.In addition, some of the warning signs occur late relative to onset of plasma leakage, and therefore have limited clinical value.

Our findings support the use of warning signs described in the 2009 WHO guideline. They also indicate that the signs are dynamic, varying during the phases of disease, and that risk assessment in the early febrile phase of disease could be enhanced with the inclusion of the additional prognostic signs we have identified. Improving the prediction of progression to severe disease could considerably improve the management of patients and health-care resource allocation in endemic areas.

In line with the 2009 WHO guidelines, we found that vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, spontaneous and mucosal bleeding, and clinical fluid accumulation were clinical features associated with severe disease. In addition, we found that the presence of specific pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease) were associated with progression to severe disease. During the first 4 days of febrile illness, individuals with a lower platelet count and serum albumin, and with higher aminotransferase concentrations (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were more likely to progress to severe disease. The infection of dengue serotype 2 among children and secondary infections were also associated with progression to severe disease.

We searched MEDLINE and PROSPERO for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and reviews up to Jan 31, 2018. The search terms were “dengue”, and one of: “dengue haemorrhage fever”, “severe dengue”, or “severity”. Only reports written in English were included. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of predictors for progression to severe disease have considered the whole time course of illness and have not differentiated the febrile phase (typically days 1–4 of illness) from the later clinical phases when severe manifestations occur. Because of variation in clinical parameters during the time course of the illness, these previous studies might have missed significant associations between early prognostic factors and progression to severe disease. In addition, not all the warning signs in the 2009 WHO dengue guideline are likely to be of use in the early prediction of severe dengue, because factors such as clinical fluid accumulation or increasing haematocrit occur late relative to the critical phases. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with progression to severe dengue disease that are detectable specifically in the febrile phase.

Dengue poses a large burden on public health systems worldwide. In the estimated burden of dengue in 2010, 70% of the global incidence of dengue infection occurred in south and southeast Asia, followed by Latin America and the western Pacific region.In 2009 to 2013, dengue epidemics were reported in some parts of subtropical regions, such as in Europe, the USA, and China.The global incidence has been estimated at 390 million infected individuals each year.Of those, an estimated 96 million individuals have symptomatic infections and 10 000–20 000 individuals die from dengue annually.Although the majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic or experience a benign febrile illness, a minority develop a life-threatening syndrome, known as severe dengue or dengue haemorrhagic fever. The progression to severe disease commonly occurs after the febrile phase, between days 4 and 6 of illness.Early detection of disease progression during the febrile phase, therefore, has a major role in improving case management and reducing the health-care burden of dengue.

The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

We did a dose-response meta-analysis for age using the R package dosresmeta.Both linear and non-linear models were fitted to estimate trends in the risk of progression to severe disease with age. The Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion were used to select the optimal model.

To investigate the robustness of the pooled estimates, a sensitivity analysis was done in which studies with extreme effect sizes and heterogeneity were removed. A sensitivity analysis on the effect of platelet count was done by removing the two studies reporting odds ratios (ORs) instead of standardised mean differences (SMDs). Finally, the small-study effect was assessed to detect any publication bias using visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's test. Publication bias was suspected when the p value of the Egger's test was less than 0·05.We used Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill methodto assess the sensitivity of the crude estimates to publication bias and to adjust the pooled effect sizes accordingly.

Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and the Istatistic. Studies were considered to be heterogeneous at a p value for the Cochran Q statistic of less than 0·1; the levels of heterogeneity were categorised as low (I<25%), low to moderate (25% to <50%), moderate to high (50% to <75%), or high (≥75%).If heterogeneity was suspected, subgroup analysis was done if there were more than four studies in each subgroup. The heterogeneity of the pooled effect sizes among subgroups was also considered with the Cochran Q statistic. The agreement between reviewers in study selection was assessed using Cohen's κ.

We did a meta-analysis to combine the effect sizes of factors potentially associated with disease progression using R version 3.4.3 and the R package meta.Combining the classifications of severe illness from the 1997 and 2009 WHO guidelines,we divided dengue progression into two groups: individuals who progressed to severe disease (defined as dengue haemorrhagic fever according to 1997 guidelines or severe dengue according to 2009 guidelines) and individuals who did not progress to severe disease (dengue fever and non-severe dengue; appendix pp 5–7 ). Each risk factor was analysed separately in univariable meta-analysis. For continuous variables, we standardised the sample means and SDs.Effect sizes and SEs were calculated using Hedge's g, which is a bias-corrected standardised mean difference. The effect sizes from the univariable analyses and multivariable models were pooled separately. Random-effects models were used to generate pooled estimates because populations were all assumed to be different. The DerSimonian–Laird method was used to estimate the between-study variance. In addition, we did subgroup analyses of studies in children (study population age <18 years) and adults (≥18 years) to identify prognostic factors specific to those populations. The age cutoff in some studies was inconsistent and not always explicitly defined. For example, patients aged between 14 years and 18 years were classified as adults in some studies and as children in others. We assigned studies as being in adults or children based on the definition used within each study.

To assess the quality and risk of bias of the studies, the Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies (QUIPS) tool was used.Two reviewers (SS and either DM or AB) assessed the quality independently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Data extraction and study quality assessment were done using Microsoft Excel 365.

Data extraction was done using a standardised data extraction form ( appendix p 4 ). For factors reported in at least four studies, we extracted crude measures of association from univariable analyses and adjusted measures of association from multivariable models. Articles that reported the same hospital of recruitment, period of study, and associated factors were identified as duplicates, in which case only the study with the largest sample size was included.

Duplicate articles were removed using EndNote X8 software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA), and the list of remaining articles was subsequently checked for duplicates manually. Abstract screening and full-text selection were done independently by two reviewers (SS and DM) using predefined eligibility criteria ( appendix p 2 ) and Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer (AB), and the final decision was then made by consensus. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to report associations between predictors detected during the febrile phase of dengue or the first 4 days of illness and dengue severity. In addition, predictors included in the meta-analysis had to be reported in at least four studies.

We searched six medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus) for publications on predictors of severe dengue or dengue haemorrhagic fever from Jan 1, 1997, to Jan 31, 2020. For relevant grey literature we searched Open Grey, and for relevant dissertations we searched ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. The search terms and full eligibility criteria are described in the appendix (pp 2–3 ). The search was restricted to original articles written in English (books, conference abstracts, comments, notes, and letters were excluded) and was adjusted for each database. Medical subject headings terms and the explode feature were used when applicable ( appendix p 1 ). The search terms and strategy were verified by a medical reference librarian to ensure that the syntax was correct and complete.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we followed the protocol described in the PRISMA-P guidelinesand the steps discussed in the guide to systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factor studies by Riley and colleagues.

Using the QUIPS tool to assess risk of bias in six domains ( appendix p 47 ), we found a high risk of bias in terms of potential confounders not being addressed and adjusted for appropriately. There was also a considerable risk of bias in terms of patient participation because some studies recruited patients from the inpatient department, which could have missed some patients presenting with mild symptoms. The risk of bias in terms of study attrition was low. Although the risk of bias in terms of measurement of outcomes and prognostic factors was low because the included studies used definitions based on WHO guidelines, 25% of included studies were considered to have a moderate risk of bias for outcomes and prognostic factors.

In the meta-analysis of viral serotypes, DENV-2 tended to be associated with progression to severe dengue compared with other serotypes in the main analysis, but the findings were not significant ( figure 4 ). DENV-2 was significantly associated with progression to severe disease in the subgroup analysis of studies in children ( figure 5 ). Children infected with DENV-2 were at a higher risk of developing severe dengue than children infected with DENV-1 (OR 1·81 [95% CI 1·24–2·65]) or DENV-3 (2·24 [1·48–3·38]; figure 5 ).

Four studies were included in the meta-analysis of viraemia, which found no significant association between viraemia and progression to severe disease ( appendix p 46 ).We found high heterogeneity in these studies (I=95%; appendix p 46 ). Two of the four studies found no significant association between viraemia and progression to severe disease, one study showed that higher viraemia was associated with severe disease, and one study found that lower viraemia was associated with severe disease. In one study, a positive association between viraemia and progression to severe dengue was observed in adults with secondary infections with dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3), whereas a negative association was found in children with secondary infections with DENV-1.

Secondary infection with dengue virus (versus primary infection) was significantly associated with progression to severe dengue ( figure 4 ), particularly in children ( figure 5 ). The significant association remained in a sensitivity analysis in which we omitted the two studies with the largest effect sizes and most heterogenous associations.The heterogeneity in the pooled results of the main analysis and sensitivity analysis were moderate to high. In the subgroup analysis by age, heterogeneity was moderate to high in adults and no heterogeneity was found in children.

Four studies were included in the meta-analysis of serum albumin, all of which used the 1997 WHO classification (no studies using the 2009 WHO definition reported associations with serum albumin). All studies consistently reported that individuals who progressed to dengue haemorrhagic fever had lower serum albumin concentrations than individuals who did not progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever during the febrile phase, with low to moderate heterogeneity and no publication bias ( figure 2 ).

Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis of aminotransferase concentrations. One study reported ORs for associations between disease progression and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) abnormality, with a normal cutoff value at 40 units per dL.The ORs were first transformed into SMDs and then pooled with the other effect sizes.Meta-analyses assessing the associations of disease progression with AST or ALT showed that higher concentrations of these enzymes during the febrile phase were associated with progression to severe disease ( figure 2 ). These positive associations were supported by the results of sensitivity analyses in which we omitted the studies reporting the results with the greatest effect sizes (one study for ASTand two studies for ALT; figure 2 ). We found publication bias in both meta-analyses for AST and ALT ( appendix p 44–45 ). However, the adjusted pooled SMDs after use of the trim and fill method were significant (AST, 0·81 [95% CI 0·20–1·42]; ALT, 0·73 [0·36–1·09]).

The haematological parameters of haematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count were included in the meta-analyses. Of these, only platelet count was significantly associated with progression to severe disease when measured during the febrile phase ( figure 2 ). Of the 12 studies assessing platelet count as a predictor of disease progression that were included in the meta-analysis, two reported ORswhich were transformed and pooled with the SMDs reported in the other studies. The pooled SMD of platelet count was significantly lower among individuals who progressed to severe disease than among individuals who did not. This finding was supported by the result of a sensitivity analysis in which we omitted the two studies originally reporting ORs ( figure 2 ).We also found a significant association between platelet count and progression to severe disease in a subgroup analysis of studies that used the 1997 WHO classification ( figure 2 ) and a subgroup analysis of studies in children ( figure 3 ). We found neither heterogeneity nor publication bias in the sensitivity analysis. We found no significant association between haematocrit levels or white blood cell count and progression to severe disease in any of the analyses ( Figure 2 Figure 3 ).

Rash and headache were not significantly associated with progression to severe disease, with no evidence of publication bias. Heterogeneity was not found in the pooled results of headache but was high in the pooled results of rash. A positive tourniquet test was not significantly associated with progression to severe disease and we found low heterogeneity and no publication bias in the pooled results of this sign. In the sensitivity analysis, a positive tourniquet test was associated with progression to severe disease, with an OR of 1·62 (95% CI 1·09–2·39).

For clinical fluid accumulation (either pleural effusion or ascites detectable during the first 4 days of illness), four studies were included; three referred to both ascites and pleural effusionand one referred to pleural effusion only.Despite the small number of studies included in this analysis and little information on the method used for detecting effusion, we found a significant association between clinical fluid accumulation during the first 4 days of illness and progression to severe dengue, with low to moderate heterogeneity (I=31%; figure 4 ).

Individuals presenting with bleeding (defined as mucosal or spontaneous) had a higher risk of progressing to severe disease than did individuals without bleeding ( figure 4 ). We did a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the potential effect of the two bleeding definitions; the difference between the pooled ORs obtained using the two definitions (mucosal or spontaneous) was not significant (Q statistic p=0·26). The positive association between bleeding and progression to severe disease was also consistent in the sensitivity analysis (ie, having removed two studies), with no heterogeneity observed in the sensitivity analysis.

In terms of clinical signs and symptoms, we found that presenting with vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, bleeding, or clinical fluid accumulation was associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease ( figure 4 ). The definition of vomiting was not given in most of the included studies, although two of eight studies defined vomiting as at least two episodes during the febrile phase of the illness.For vomiting, a significant association was found in both pooled analyses (crude and adjusted estimates; figure 4 appendix p 43 ), and neither heterogeneity nor publication bias was found. Abdominal pain and tenderness were also consistently associated with progression to severe disease (OR 1·92 [95% CI 1·35–2·74]), although the definition was not given in all included studies and high heterogeneity was found (I≥75%).

Five studies reported associations between nutritional status and progression to severe disease, four of which included only children. For children, nutritional status was based on their bodyweight for age, according to local standardised guidelines, whereas for adults, body-mass index (BMI) was used (malnourished defined as a BMI of <18 kg/mand obese defined as a BMI of >30 kg/m). We found some evidence that malnourishment was associated with a reduced risk of developing severe dengue and obesity was associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease, although neither association was significant ( figure 4 ). In comparison with individuals with malnourishment, individuals with obesity were at a significantly higher risk of developing severe disease.

The presence of mixed comorbidity was not associated with progression to severe disease ( figure 4 ). Hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease were positively associated with progression to severe dengue ( figure 4 ), with associations strongest for diabetes (OR 4·38 [95% CI 2·58–7·43]) and renal disease (4·67 [2·21–9·88]). For the pooled ORs of the four comorbidities, heterogeneity was moderate to high or high in both the main analyses and sensitivity analyses, with the exception of renal disease, for which heterogeneity was low to moderate in the main analysis and low in the sensitivity analysis. As with the pooled adjusted OR taken from multivariable models, the presence of diabetes also increased the risk of progression to severe disease, with an OR of 1·87 (1·30–2·73).

The association between sex and progression to severe disease was significant in the main analysis but not in a sensitivity analysis in which two studies were removed due to their extreme effect sizes and heterogeneity ( figure 4 ).There was evidence of publication bias in the studies assessing sex as a predictor of disease progression that were included in the meta-analysis (Egger's test p=0·021). The pooled OR after use of the trim and fill method to account for publication bias was 0·95 (95% CI 0·84–1·08; appendix p 43 ). In the subgroup analysis by age, female sex was associated with a higher risk of progression to severe disease in adults but not in children ( figure 5 ).

The age profile of patients who progressed to severe disease was not significantly different from the age profile of patients who did not ( figure 2 ). Heterogeneity in the pooled results was high in the main meta-analysis and low to moderate in the sensitivity analysis that excluded four studies with extreme effect sizes and heterogeneity ( figure 2 ). In the subgroup analysis of studies by age group, adults who progressed to severe disease were significantly older than adults who did not (SMD 0·1 [95% CI 0·02–0·18]; figure 3 ). For the adjusted associations of age from multivariable models, all included studies were done in children and used the 1997 WHO classification. We found that younger children were at higher risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever than older children, with the odds of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever reducing by 8% (95% CI 2–14) for every year of increase in age ( appendix p 40 ). In a dose-response meta-analysis, we found that a linear model between the OR of disease progression and age achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion, with an OR of 1·03 (95% CI 0·96–1·11) for each year of increase in age, but this result was not statistically significant ( appendix pp 41–42 ).

In sensitivity analyses of all factors except platelet count, studies were excluded due to extreme effect sizes and heterogeneity. For platelet count, the sensitivity analysis was done excluding studies that reported odds ratios instead of SMDs. SMD=standardised mean difference.

Among the 150 studies included in the systematic review, we identified 203 factors tested for their association with disease progression, 25 of which were reported in at least four studies and were thus included in the meta-analyses. These factors were grouped into four domains: demographics and comorbidities (nine factors), clinical signs and symptoms (seven factors), patient laboratory parameters (seven factors), and viral-related biomarkers (two factors). The definitions of identified factors included in this meta-analysis are in the appendix (p 34–37 ). Here, we report the pooled crude associations for all 25 factors, and the pooled adjusted associations for age, diabetes, and vomiting. A summary of our findings is presented in the table

Table Summary of factors detectable within the first 4 days of illness and their association with progression to severe dengue disease

Our initial searches identified 6643 articles, of which 150 were included in the systematic review and 122 were included in the meta-analysis ( figure 1 ). In the selection of studies, agreement between the two reviewers was moderate (κ index 0·70 [95% CI 0·63–0·77] and 87% agreement [95% CI 82–90]). More than 80% of the included studies (121 of 150) were done in Asia and Latin America and published between 2008 and 2020. 60% (90 of 150) of the selected studies were done using a cohort study design, 29% (44 of 150) were nested case-control, case-cohort, or case-control studies, and the remaining 11% (16 of 150) were cross-sectional studies. Around 60% (87 of 150) of the studies defined severity outcomes using the 1997 WHO classification,and the remaining studies used the 2009 WHO classification.Details of the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis are presented in the appendix (p 8)

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified that younger age in children, older age in adults, and female sex were demographical risk factors for progression to severe disease. Pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and presenting with vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, bleeding, or clinical fluid accumulation during the febrile phase of illness, were also associated with progression to severe disease. In addition, DENV-2 infection among children, secondary infection, a lower platelet count, lower serum albumin, and higher AST and ALT concentrations detected during the febrile phase were significantly associated with progression to severe disease ( table ).

et al. Age-related changes in microvascular permeability: a significant factor in the susceptibility of children to shock?. The finding of a higher risk of progression to severe disease in older adults could be due to co-existing diabetes, hypertension, or renal disease, which are common in older adults. In the meta-analysis of studies in children, a pooled OR from multivariable models, which were already adjusted for immune response, showed that younger children were at a higher risk of progression to severe disease, which might be due to increased vascular filtration capacity among younger children.

Female sex was associated with progression to severe disease in the main analysis and in a subgroup analysis of studies in adults. The higher risk of progression to severe dengue in women could be in part due to different health-seeking behaviours or differences in the immune response between men and women.

et al. Endothelial nitric oxide pathways in the pathophysiology of dengue: a prospective observational study. Diabetes and hypertension were included as risk factors for progression to severe illness in the 1997 and 2009 WHO guidelines.The findings from our meta-analysis support inclusion of these risk factors. Although the pathophysiology underlying the contribution of diabetes to progression of dengue is not fully understood, factors including pre-existing vasculature damage and associated endothelial activation might contribute. Lee and colleaguesfound that patients with poor glycaemic control (HbA>7%), with or without an additional comorbidity, were at a higher risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome than were patients with diabetes with adequate glycaemic control and no additional comorbidity. Our meta-analysis also showed positive associations between underlying renal disease or cardiovascular disease and progression to severe dengue. Chronic kidney disease could result in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could add to the risk of vascular injury during dengue infections.Uraemia, commonly found in chronic kidney disease, also causes endothelial dysfunction, predisposing individuals to worse dengue-associated vasculopathy.However, associations between renal disease or cardiovascular disease and disease progression should be interpreted with caution because they were not adjusted for potential confounders, such as diabetes or hypertension, which are major causes of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.

Several clinical signs or symptoms were associated with progression to severe disease. We found a robust association with vomiting, with no heterogeneity, whereas high heterogeneity was found in the meta-analysis of abdominal pain and tenderness. This finding is probably due to the subjective nature of the symptom, which depends on both the patient and the physician doing the clinical examination. Bleeding as a clinical entity varies widely from gum bleeding to haematochezia or melaena. However, the presence of minor bleeding (ie, mucosal and spontaneous bleeding) during the febrile phase could be a prognostic sign for progression to severe disease.

All patients with dengue develop a spectrum of plasma leakage, and the presence of either pleural effusion or ascites, which can be classified as clinical fluid accumulation, can be a consequence of severe plasma leakage in the critical phase. However, the clinical detection of pleural effusion or ascites can reflect an increased risk of decompensation in the critical phase. Clinical fluid accumulation is particularly useful when the effusion is detected early within the febrile phase, before severe dengue develops. It will also increase in utility with time, given that the use of ultrasonography in low-income and middle-income countries is increasing and thresholds of detection of pleural effusion or ascites will decrease due to increased sensitivity of detection by ultrasound.

Dengue haemorrhagic fever: diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Although the use of a tourniquet test is recommended for diagnosing dengue haemorrhagic fever in the 1997 and 2009 WHO guidelines,we found no evidence that this test allows early prediction of progression to severe disease. All studies of tourniquet test and progression used the 1997 WHO classification, in which the positive tourniquet test itself is a diagnostic criterion for dengue haemorrhagic fever. The positive association obtained in the sensitive analysis could therefore reflect this bias.

Comprehensive guideline for prevention and control of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever. Haematological analyses have been used for dengue diagnosis and severity classification in a variety of health-care settings, from primary to tertiary. Platelet count was significantly associated with disease progression in our study, with patients with low platelet count showing a higher risk of progressing to severe disease. This finding is consistent with the observed decrease in platelet counts recorded in other observational studiesand confirms platelet count as one of the key WHO warning signs.Although this meta-analysis could not provide robust clinical evidence of a platelet count cutoff to determine the risk of severe dengue, the majority of the average platelet counts in non-severe dengue groups were higher than 100 000 cells per dL. This value is in line with recommendations from the 1997 WHO dengue guideline and 2011 WHO South-East Asia region (SEARO) dengue guideline.

Our analysis shows that higher concentrations of AST and ALT in the febrile phase are significantly associated with severe dengue and supports their monitoring during the febrile phase. However, potential confounders should be taken into consideration, such as co-infection with chronic hepatitis viruses, which increases the likelihood of hepatic dysfunctions and is common in dengue-endemic countries. Regarding the cutoff values for AST and ALT concentrations, we suggest that concentrations higher than three times the upper limit of normal are associated with progression to severe disease on the basis of the majority of the average AST and ALT concentrations reported in the included studies.

50 WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia

Comprehensive guideline for prevention and control of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever. In our meta-analysis, serum albumin concentration during the febrile phase was significantly lower in individuals with severe dengue than in those with uncomplicated dengue. This finding is consistent with vascular leakage, with early extravasation of albumin along with plasma. However, serum albumin concentration can vary depending on pre-existing nutritional status, and therefore its use as a clinical cutoff might be challenging in practice. We would support the 2011 SEARO dengue guideline recommendation that a serum albumin concentration of 3·5 g/dL or lower, or a reduction by 0·5 g/dL during the febrile phase compared with baseline, is associated with progression to severe disease.

Haematocrit and white blood cell count within 4 days of disease onset were not associated with disease severity in the critical phase. However, monitoring haematocrit remains essential for detecting plasma leakage in the critical phase.

DENV-2 was significantly associated with progression to severe dengue among studies in children, but there was no significant association among studies in adults or in the main meta-analysis. Because crude pooled associations were presented, the association between DENV-2 and severity among studies in adults could be confounded by other factors (eg, immune status, the sequence of infecting serotypes, time interval between infections, and pre-existing comorbidities).

Dengue vaccine: WHO position paper, September 2018—recommendations. The association between secondary infection and development of severe dengue is well documented and most likely represents antibody-dependent enhancement, whereby non-neutralising antibodies from the primary infection increase viral uptake into cells and a higher host viral burden. The observed association between secondary dengue infection and severe dengue is in line with several previous studies,including a modelling studyshowing that 18% (95% CI 16–20) of primary infections and 41% (0·36–0·45) of secondary infections are severe. In addition, the association between secondary infection and severe dengue was notably weaker in the subgroup analysis among adults, compared with that in children. This finding supports the effect of age on secondary infection and disease severityand the hypothesis that tertiary and quaternary infections are generally milder than secondary infections.However, methods to distinguish tertiary and quaternary infections from secondary dengue infection are not widely available outside of research settings and prospective research studies, although such methods would be useful clinically.Immune status testing at one early timepoint (during days 1–4 of illness) is also challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing primary from secondary infections without acute and convalescent samples. Secondary infections are associated with a higher risk of progression to severe disease, but until more robust point-of-care diagnostics are developed,incorporating immune status into early prediction models is difficult. Such rapid diagnostic tests would also inform vaccination campaigns.

et al. Factors associated with dengue shock syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that individuals with malnourishment tended to be less likely to progress to severe dengue, although the association was significant only when compared with individuals with obesity. People who are malnourished might have a suppressed cellular immune response, causing reduced organ and tissue injury.Although we found no significant association between obesity or bodyweight and progression to severe dengue, a systematic review published in 2013 found a significant risk of dengue shock syndrome in children with obesity.This inconsistency could be due to the different outcomes used (ie, dengue shock syndrome instead of dengue haemorrhagic fever or severe dengue).

We found high heterogeneity in the pooled results of viraemia, which could be explained by the large individual-level variability, with measurements being taken at different times during infection and with different measurement methods across laboratories. Although peak viraemia could be a more consistent and robust metric to assess the association with severe dengue, it is often missed by the time patients present in hospital. In addition, quantification of blood viraemia might not reflect the total body viral load sequestered intracellularly.

Few studies reported adjusted effect sizes, so we mostly pooled crude effect sizes, which could have been overestimated due to confounders. In the few instances in which meta-analyses were done with a small number of studies, pooled effect sizes should be interpreted with caution. Some factors were not clearly defined and could therefore present inconsistencies among studies. The quality of the final diagnosis and the method used to assign the final diagnosis, including evidence supporting the diagnoses, were not always clearly mentioned in the included studies. The presence of effusion, presence of bleeding, and platelet counts are also clinical outcomes of dengue haemorrhagic fever, which could affect the associations between these three prognostic factors and progression to severe disease. However, subgroup analyses by classification were done when data were available. Genetic factors were not included in this meta-analysis because these have not been routinely analysed along with clinical outcomes, and the study design and methodologies adopted for this area differ to those used to analyse clinical outcomes. Direct comparisons between clinical outcomes and genetic factors are therefore difficult. Limiting the selection of studies to those written in English might also have reduced the precision of the estimates. However, more than 80% of included studies were done in southeast Asia and Latin America. Therefore, the findings of this study are likely to be representative of practice in endemic areas. In addition, our meta-analysis did not capture all pre-existing comorbidities (eg, sickle cell disease or malaria infection), the use of non-invasive clinical monitoring (eg, ultrasonography, arterial pulse waveform, or side-stream darkfield imaging), or the role of novel biomarkers in dengue, which are of great research interest and represent a promising avenue to better understand dengue pathogenesis and identify new biomarkers.Unfortunately, the number of studies involving these biomarkers is small to date, and substantial heterogeneity in study designs hindered our ability to define roles for every clinical factor or novel biomarker.

In this study, we have shown that monitoring serum albumin, AST, and ALT during the febrile phase of illness, in addition to the warning signs detailed in the 2009 WHO guidelines, could enhance the ability to predict the risk of a patient developing severe dengue. In addition, identifying the infecting viral serotype and the immunological status (eg, primary vs post-primary infections) during the febrile phase could further improve the accuracy of the risk predictions. Further prospective studies focusing on the febrile phase of illness will allow investigation of the role of novel biomarkers and non-invasive methods, such as ultrasonography, in predicting the early onset of severe dengue, with the ultimate objective of improving patient triage and allocation of resources, and reducing hospital morbidity, mortality, and the health and economic impact of dengue worldwide."

By Maria Fernanda Ziegler | Agência FAPESP – Yellow fever was the first human disease to have a licensed vaccine and has long been considered important to an understanding of how epidemics happen and should be combated. It was introduced to the Americas in the seventeenth century, and high death rates have resulted from successive outbreaks since then. Epidemics of yellow fever were associated with the slave trade, the US gold rush and settlement of the Old West, the Haitian Revolution, and construction of the Panama Canal, to cite only a few examples.

Centuries after the disease was first reported in the Americas, an international team of researchers will embark on a groundbreaking study to develop models that predict epidemics of yellow fever and other diseases caused by mosquito-borne arboviruses such as dengue, zika, and chikungunya.

“Knowledge of these diseases, their cycles ,and the possibilities of new outbreaks is very well-established, but we still lack a systematic understanding of how to predict when outbreaks will occur. Our goal is to create predictive models to help monitor and combat outbreaks, protect the public, and develop a deeper understanding of the combination of factors that leads to epidemics,” said Maurício Lacerda Nogueira, a professor at the São José do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, and a member of the CREATE-NEO project funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The new study is part of a Thematic Project supported by FAPESP to monitor the mosquito population in the urban area of São José do Rio Preto and the monkey and mosquito populations in the transition zone between rural and urban Manaus, the Amazonas state capital.

In addition to FAMERP, the Brazilian research centers that are participating in the initiative include the National Institute for Research on the Amazon (INPA), the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), the Federal University of Amazonas (UF AM), and the Heitor Vieira Dourado Foundation for Tropical Medicine (FMT-HVD). Participants located elsewhere include the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), New Mexico State University (NMSU), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in the US, and the Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (ICGES) in Panama, among others.

An article written by the researchers to mark the project’s inception is published in Emerging Topics in Life Science, reviewing the factors that influence the potential re-emergence of yellow fever in the Neotropics.

“Deforestation, seasonal variations in rainfall and non-human primate populations are all factors that influence outbreaks, but we need to know the tipping-point for each one, and to find that out we’ll develop predictive models based on research and monitoring conducted in arbovirus hotspots in São Paulo, Amazonas and the Pantanal in Brazil, and in Panama,” Nogueira said.

The history of yellow fever shows that outbreaks occur at intervals of between seven and ten years. “Brazil has many arboviruses, with outbreaks and even epidemics in progress all the time,” said Livia Sacchetto, also a researcher at FAMERP and a member of CREATE-NEO.

From forest to city and vice-versa

According to Sacchetto, the project also aims to find out more about spillovers and, if possible, anticipate these outbreaks in which arboviruses jump from humans to animals or vice-versa. Dengue, zika, and chikungunya are transmitted to humans and non-human primates by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In the case of yellow fever, A. aegypti is the urban vector but mosquitoes of a different genus (Haemagogus) are responsible for transmission in the countryside (sylvatic cycle).

Despite the existence of a highly effective vaccine since 1937, and no reported cases caused by urban transmission since 1942, sylvatic outbreaks of yellow fever frequently spill over into cities. “Many people and monkeys die of yellow fever in Brazil and other parts of the Americas, as well as in Africa,” Sacchetto said. “Despite the vaccine and progress in controlling transmission of the disease, we continue to see cases emerging from the sylvatic cycle. The virus is endemic in part of Brazil, with persistent circulation between mosquitoes and non-human primates, which are its primary hosts.”

This enzootic cycle is far from easy to control. “Once established, the enzootic cycle ensures that the virus stays in forests or other rural areas, but it can spread to a city via accidental infection of a human,” she said. Circulation of the virus in cities raises concerns about a return of the urban cycle involving transmission by A. aegypti. “Hence the importance of epidemiological surveillance studies and maintenance of large-scale vaccine coverage to control outbreaks.”

Predictive models for arboviruses also take into account climate change and urbanization destroying native vegetation. “We have active cases of yellow fever in both non-human primates and humans in the Southern states of Paraná and Santa Catarina. This hasn’t happened for several decades,” Nogueira said.

In Africa, from which yellow fever came to the Americas, most cases of the disease occur in the sub-Saharan region. Urban yellow fever is a major public health concern, with frequent outbreaks that are hard to predict.

In the Americas, as the authors of the review article note, yellow fever has historically been reported from northern Panama to northeastern Argentina. In recent years, most cases have occurred in the Amazon Basin during the rainy season, when population densities of Haemagogus mosquitoes are at their highest, but the number of reported cases following sylvatic spillover has increased in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, as well as Brazil.

SAN JOSE DE BUENAVISTA, Antique – The Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) is urging the public to remain vigilant against dengue as Antique already recorded 18 cases with one death during the first 16 days of January this year.

Dr. Leoncio Abiera, Jr. of the IPHO, in an interview on Wednesday, identified the lone fatality as a 38-year-old male from Barangay Mag-aba, Pandan who died on Jan. 8.

“From Jan. 1 to 16, the 17 live cases were reported from the towns of Culasi, Sibalom with four each; Tibiao, Tobias Fornier, Hamtic, San Jose de Buenavista with two each; and, San Remigio with one case,” he said.

Abiera said that they are urging the public to seek early consultation so that they could receive early treatment.

“Although the number of dengue cases is lower as compared with last year’s 46 for the same period, but then we are urging the people not to be afraid to go to their doctors for consultation,” he said.

He said that due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) people are hesitant to go to the hospital for consultation because they are afraid that they might be contaminated.

“There are people who refuse to go to the health facilities also because they might be suspected to have Covid-19,” he said.

He said the person suffering from Covid-19 also develops a fever, which is similar to dengue.

“People should have to seek medical treatment already if after three days their fever does not subside,” he said.

He said that they can even just have online consultation with their doctors if they are indeed afraid to go to the hospital.

“We also have the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits for dengue available,” Abiera added. (PNA)"

Samples of the suspected cases from Dolo Ado have been sent to the regional laboratory in Hawassa for confirmation.

The affected zones have a history of past Dengue fever outbreaks in 2017 and 2018. Weakened nutritional status of the community due to prolonged drought and the resulting reduced resistance to infections as well as population displacement are contributing factors to the detected increase in Dengue fever cases in the affected districts.

WHO representative, Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, underscored the need to destroy mosquitoes’ breeding sites and prevent mosquito bites to interrupt transmission of dengue fever. “Families and communities need to care for the most vulnerable such as women, children and persons with chronic illnesses, and also seek medical attention immediately when feeling unwell,” he added. Dr Sambo also called for continued government leadership and strong public health measures to scale and speed up the response and halt the spread of dengue fever.

WHO Ethiopia country office is supporting the outbreak response through coordination, disease and entomological surveillance, sample collection and transportation, supply of medicines, social mobilization, and on-the-job training on case management at the health facilities in the affected zones.

Dengue is a viral infection that is common in warm, tropical climates that causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a complication called severe dengue. It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Unlike other mosquitoes Ae. aegypti is a day-time feeder; its peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk. The Aedes aegypti mosquito lives close to human populations, laying its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house or surrounding areas, including non-used bottles, containers, discarded waste and tyres which hold water.

By combining genetic data from the mosquitoes and environmental data from satellites, the authors mapped “landscape connectivity” — defined as how a landscape facilitates the movements of organisms and their genes across large areas.
One cutting-edge method of control is releasing genetically-modified mosquitoes into existing populations, in an effort to stunt reproduction and spread of the disease.
The authors say they expect connectivity maps like those they’ve created to be useful in designing more strategic releases of modified mosquitoes.
“Connectivity maps can also be essential for the protection of endangered native species,’’ says Pless, “for example, in designing corridors to connect fragmented populations.”","using, research, method, pesticides, connectivity, mosquitoes, landscape, ae, maps, environmental, mosquitoborne, deadly, viruses, aegypti, control",dengue,idiosyncratic,"The black dots on the map show the sites where the research team collected Aedis aegypti samples.

Because Ae. aegypti prefers to bite humans and there are no vaccines for many of these diseases they carry, developing methods to control these insects is imperative in the fight to control illness. In a study recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a Yale-led research team developed a new method to track how Ae. aegypti move through the environment. By combining genetic data from the mosquitoes and environmental data from satellites, the authors mapped “landscape connectivity” — defined as how a landscape facilitates the movements of organisms and their genes across large areas. In particular, the researchers developed a new workflow that more effectively models how Ae. aegypti are moving through the landscape in the southern U.S.“Connectivity maps allow managers to make informed decisions based on how mosquitoes are likely to move through a landscape,” says, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis and a PhD graduate of Yale’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology . “Our results suggest that in the southern U.S., Ae. aegypti travels by a mix of natural and human-aided dispersal, taking advantage of regions that are warmer and flatter, as well as human transportation networks.”Pless co-authored the paper with, a research scientist with the Center for Research Computing and the Yale School of the Environment;assistant professor of biology at Utah State University; andandfrom the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale.Now, the most common method for controlling invasive, disease-carrying species like Ae. aegypti is by using pesticides, which are not eco-friendly. “We now know some pesticides cause environmental harm, including harm to humans,” says Saarman. “At the same time, mosquitoes are evolving resistance to the pesticides that we have found to be safe for the environment.

“This creates a challenge that can only be solved by more information on where mosquitoes live and how they get around.""

One cutting-edge method of control is releasing genetically-modified mosquitoes into existing populations, in an effort to stunt reproduction and spread of the disease. The authors say they expect connectivity maps like those they’ve created to be useful in designing more strategic releases of modified mosquitoes.

“By integrating machine learning with an optimization process, our approach overcomes constraints of previous methods and should be helpful for more precise planning of vector control actions,” says Amatulli.

The authors also believe this novel advance could have broader applications, including in conservation and environmental protection.

“Connectivity maps can also be essential for the protection of endangered native species,’’ says Pless, “for example, in designing corridors to connect fragmented populations.”"

“In 2020 we identified 30,802 dengue patients compared to 105,049 in 2019, which is a considerable improvement,” Dr Indika Weerasinghe of the Health Ministry’s National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) told EconomyNext.

“This is mainly owing to the restrictions imposed during the lockdown, which gave people an opportunity to concentrate on their surroundings, clean their environment and prevent mosquito-breeding,” he added.

A health ministry study showed that of the 105,049 dengue cases in 2019, nearly 50% were recorded in the fourth quarter. This increase was continued to the early months of the following year, when nearly 50% of cases for 2020 were reported during January and February.

However, starting in March 2020, a rapid decrease in cases was observed throughout the year, totaling at 30,802. Last year’s numbers are on par with the dengue statistics for the years 2011, 2013 and 2015 at 28,473, 32,063 and 29,777 respectively.

With 12 percent of the country total being reported from Batticaloa, the district recorded the highest incidence of dengue in 2020 at 700 patients per 100,000 people surveyed. Since the 39th week of last year, the district has contributed to 66% of the cases reported island wide.

In January 2021, Sri Lanka recorded 1,360 dengue cases with the highest number recorded again in the Baticaloa district amounting to 794. Colombo recorded 97, while Gampaha and Kurunegala recorded 44 and 43 respectively. In February so far 1,002 patients have been reported island wide.

The study noted in its report that, despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation prevailing in the country, the regular dengue control measures were carried out uninterrupted through the central, provincial, district and Medical Officers of Health (MOH) level health teams

“During 2020, six Special Mosquito Control Campaigns were carried out by the NDCU targeting high risk areas for outbreaks, inspecting over 200, 000 premises island wide,” the report said.

Daily premise inspections through Saukya Karya Sahayaka (Mosquito Control) personnel were carried out at the MOH level adapting to local situations, Dr Weerasinghe said, noting that a guide for field inspections on COVID 19 precautions was also developed and implemented by the NDCU for all involved field staff.

“The inter-sectoral coordination which is vital for successful implementation of dengue control activities was sustained in Western Province through regular reviews kept number of dengue patients within the province at bay,” he added.

Dr Weerasinghe further said only 35 dengue-related deaths were reported in 2020 compared to 157 reported a year earlier.

The NDCU study further reveals that during the premise inspection programmes conducted during the recent years, the leading premise types for mosquito breeding were construction sites, schools, institutions, harbours, public places, etc, while residences reported comparatively lower breeding places.

Staying at home might have, therefore, reduced the human contact with high risk localities for mosquito breeding, the study noted.

Leptospirosis, Dengue and Typhoid have claimed seven lives so far this year.

5 people have died from leptospirosis, one has died due to typhoid while another person died from dengue.

The Ministry of Health says they recorded 160 leptospirosis cases, 335 dengue cases and 53 typhoid cases nationwide.

It says the recent natural disasters have escalated the surge in the cases in various sub-divisions.

The Ministry of Health further says dengue is below expected levels nationally except in Levuka and there is a risk of a rise in cases, especially in the North, once the rainfall slows down and there is an increase in stagnant water pooling.

Clinical teams of specialists have been established in addition to the public health workers performing outreach programs in Sigatoka, Rakiraki, Navosa, Nadarivatu, Nabouwalu and Savusavu.

The Ministry adds these teams will facilitate community awareness and public health measures to reduce the risk of the spread of leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue and will further ensure that community screening remains a priority for early diagnosis and treatment.

You are strongly advised to be mindful of the sources of these diseases and to adhere to the advisories issued for the prevention of these diseases.

The bacteria that cause leptospirosis are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and can survive there for weeks, even months. Humans can become infected through contact with urine from infected animals or contact with water, soil, or food contaminated with the urine of infected animals.

Dengue fever is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infective mosquito while people who drink contaminated water or eat food washed in contaminated water can develop typhoid fever. You can also get typhoid by using a toilet contaminated with bacteria and touching your mouth before washing your hands."

Guangzhou is a first-tier city located in South China (Fig. 1), having an area of 7434 km2 and comprising over 15 million permanent residents until the end of 2019. The climate of Guangzhou is humid and subtropical, with high temperatures and humidity in summer and comparatively mild and dry weather in winter. The suitable climate, large floating population, and close proximity to Southeast Asia where dengue has been hyperendemic for decades, renders Guangzhou the most threatened city in China [48,49,50].

Fig. 1 Study area. All 167 townships in Guangzhou City, China Full size image

As shown in Fig. 1, the 167 townships of Guangzhou were used as urban units in this study for fine-grained intra-urban dengue predictions. According to statistics, approximately 20% of townships have areas of less than 2 km2, and 37% have less than 5 km2. The prediction units in this study are much smaller than those in the existing studies.

Dengue case data

Guangzhou experienced its worst dengue epidemic in 2014, with an incidence of 37 445 locally acquired dengue cases exceeding the historical average by two orders of magnitude [49]. Since 2015, Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have spared no effort to prevent and control dengue epidemics, reducing dengue cases in recent years. To establish prediction models under the current control policy, this study used dengue case data for Guangzhou City between January 1, 2015, and September 22, 2019, provided by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC). The attributes of each anonymous case included residential address, onset date, and type (imported or local). Residential addresses of the cases were converted to geographic coordinates using the geocoding API of Baidu Maps [51]. Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of dengue cases in Guangzhou City during the study period.

We then counted the dengue cases inside each township by week based on the onset date. Figure 3 presents the weekly imported and local case counts of the city during the study period. According to Fig. 3, we identified July 1 to November 30 as the concentrated outbreak period, when the number of dengue cases was apparently above normal.

Meteorological data

The daily mean temperature and daily rainfall recorded by nearly 300 weather stations in Guangzhou during the study period were obtained from the Guangdong Meteorological Bureau. The station-based data were spatially interpolated to a fine resolution using the ordinary Kriging method, and then averaged (for temperature) or summed (for rainfall) at the township level. Figures 4A, B illustrate the weekly mean temperature and cumulative rainfall of one arbitrarily selected township during the study period. Figures 4C, D show the weekly mean temperature and cumulative rainfall of all townships within the city during an arbitrarily selected week (i.e., September 5–11, 2016).

C Weekly mean temperature and D weekly cumulative rainfall of all townships within Guangzhou City during the week of September 12–18, 2016 Full size image

Population data

The population data of Guangzhou used in this study were obtained from the well-known open data source, WorldPop [52, 53]. However, WorldPop provides yearly population datasets from 2015 to 2019, which cannot meet the time interval (weekly) of dengue prediction. Considering that Guangzhou is a well-developed city and its spatial population distribution pattern has not changed substantially in recent years, we used the population dataset of 2017 to represent the population from 2015 to 2019.

As shown in Fig. 5, the 100-m gridded population data for 2017 were aggregated at the township level. A township with a larger population implies more hosts for the mosquito vectors and the incidence rate is more likely to be higher.

Street view images

The street-view images used in this study were obtained from Baidu Maps using the Web Service API [54]. The corresponding street-view image at the location can be obtained using the coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) and setting the field of view (i.e., the parameter “fov”), horizontal view angle (i.e., the parameter “heading”), image size (i.e., the parameters “width” and “height”), and developer key (i.e., the parameter “ak”).

The URL format for requesting an image under specific parameters is http://api.map.baidu.com/panorama/v2?ak=ReplaceYourDeveloperKey&width=400&height=300&location=113.25529,23.11419&fov=90&heading=0. Note that one needs to apply and use her/his developer key to open the example URL.

As shown in Fig. 6, by setting the parameter “heading” as 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree, we can obtain four street-view images of a given location. Those images comprehensively depict the physical environment of the location.

Fig. 6 Street-view images acquired at a location with heading degrees of 0, 90, 180, and 270 Full size image

Street-view images were acquired at a distance interval of 150 m along OpenStreetMap (OSM) [55] streets within Guangzhou City. Considering that street-view images collected in areas with few or no population are useless for depicting human living environments, we only retained images collected from spatial units (i.e., 100-m grids) with a population of no less than 10 (please refer to Fig. 5A). Thus, four street-view images can be acquired at each location (if the request is successful), resulting in 112 447 total images (512 × 512 pixels) across the city.

Method framework and steps

The framework of our methodology is illustrated in Fig. 7. To facilitate fine-grained intra-urban dengue forecasting, environmental features were extracted from street-view images and then combined with the commonly used features (i.e., past cases, temperature, rainfall, and population) as inputs to the forecasting models (i.e., MLP and SVM). Models for L-week (L = 1, 2,…, 8) ahead forecasting were separately trained and applied.

Fig. 7 Framework of the proposed approach Full size image

The processes of environmental feature extraction, common feature extraction, forecasting model construction, and forecasting performance evaluation are introduced in detail in the following sections.

Environmental feature extraction

As shown in Fig. 8, this study applied a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network called PSPNet [56] to extract the feature vector of each street-view image. The environmental features of each urban unit were then obtained by aggregating the image feature vectors collected within the unit.

Fig. 8 Extracting the environmental feature vector of an urban unit from street-view images using the pre-trained PSPNet model Full size image

The PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level scene-parsing tasks (i.e., labeling the category of all pixels within the image), and received the champion of the ImageNet Scene Parsing Challenge in 2016 [57]. As we mainly focused on outdoor scenes, this study used a PSPNet model pre-trained on the ADE20K dataset [57], which included numerous images with 150 indoor and outdoor scene categories. Feeding a street-view image into the pre-trained PSPNet, each image pixel can be labeled with one of the 150 scene categories. Based on the pre-trained model, we calculated the pixel proportions of the 64 selected outdoor scenes for each image [26]; thus, a 64-dimensional feature vector could be constructed to describe the image.

As a demonstration, Fig. 9 shows the cosine similarity matrix of four street-view images measured by their 64-dimensional feature vectors. We can see that street-view images with more similar scene elements would have more similar feature vectors [such as images (A) and (B) and images (C) and (D)], indicating that the extracted feature vectors can successfully depict physical environments at various places.

Fig. 9 Cosine similarity matrix of four street-view images measured by their feature vectors extracted from the pre-trained PSPNet model Full size image

Finally, feature vectors of street-view images collected within the same urban unit were averaged to be a 64-dimension environmental feature vector to represent the physical environment of the unit (i.e., township in our study). Thus, urban units with similar physical settings would have similar environmental features. We averaged the feature vectors of all inside images to represent the entire township because most of the townships are very small, and the population in a few larger townships is concentrated. If the spatial units were very large with a dispersed population distribution, the averaged features would have less representativeness.

Common feature extraction

This study used epidemical, meteorological, and sociodemographic variables as common features, which have been widely used and proven as important factors for dengue forecasting in previous studies [3, 9,10,11,12]. As shown in Table 1, 11 common features were extracted for each urban unit (i.e., township) from past cases (including imported and local cases), mean temperature, cumulative rainfall, and population. Epidemical and meteorological factors are dynamic features with time lags of up to four weeks, while the population factor is a static feature.

Table 1 Common features extracted for each urban unit Full size table

Forecasting model construction

This study used SVM and MLP as basic dengue forecasting models, which have been widely used in the existing literature [1]. Specifically, a linear kernel was used in the SVM-based regression model. For the MLP-based regression model, we used one hidden layer of 100 neurons, applied “tanh” as the activation function, and set the learning rate to 0.001.

The SVM/MLP models were trained separately for 1–8 weeks ahead of dengue forecasting. The input of each model consisted of a 64-dimensional environmental feature vector and an 11-dimensional common feature vector. Each feature vector dimension was normalized to a range between zero and one using the min–max feature scaling method. As for the output of the model, because strict intervention measures were taken during the study period, the number of dengue cases in Guangzhou was very small (Fig. 3), especially at the township level, making it difficult to directly predict the local case count of each township in following weeks. To alleviate the data sparsity problem, we applied an exponential smoothing technique to the time series of weekly local case counts in each township and used smoothed value as a proxy for the real case count and the output of the model. Denoting the raw time series as {\({x}_{t}\)}, the smoothed time series {\({s}_{t}\)} is obtained using the following formulas:

$$s_{0} = x_{0} ,$$ (1)

$$s_{t} = \alpha_{s} x_{t} + \left( {1 - \alpha_{s} } \right)s_{t - 1} , t > 0,$$ (2)

where \({\alpha }_{s}\) is the smoothing factor in the range [0, 1]. Setting \({\alpha }_{s}\) as 0.25, we derived the smoothed dengue case count for each township in each week. Taking a randomly selected township as an example, Fig. 10 displays the original time series of the weekly local case count and smoothed result. The data-smoothing scheme can help retain the latent temporal patterns of dengue epidemics, and mitigate the influence of data sparseness and uncertainty caused by human intervention.

Performance evaluation

Dengue forecasting conducted at a large spatial scale (e.g., country, state/province, and city) usually aims to provide an early warning. In contrast, a fine-grained intra-urban forecast focuses more on identifying regions with relatively higher risk in the near future, facilitating precise prevention and control despite limited resources. Therefore, in addition to measuring the Pearson correlation coefficient of the predicted and observed case counts, we also defined a “hit rate” metric to assess the forecasting performance from a spatial perspective by evaluating the ability of the model to identify high-risk urban units across the city.

Specifically, the hit rate metric calculates the proportion of dengue cases captured by the top \(m\)% of the predicted high-risk units during week \(t\):

$$Hit \, rate_{t} = \frac{{N_{m, t} }}{{N_{t} }},$$ (3)

where \({N}_{m, t}\) represents the number of observed cases within the top \(m\)% predicted high-risk units (i.e., ranking all units from high to low according to their predicted case counts), and \({N}_{t}\) denotes the total number of observed cases within the city. A high hit rate indicates that units with higher risk during the week have been well identified by the forecasting model."

As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002–2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95% CI 60.6–148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95% CI 78.5–80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69%) than that of the baseline model (54.5%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95% CI 102–575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95% CI 120–168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems.

Author summary Why was this study done? A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to the most at-risk places.

Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in advance. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and locations.

We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6 months ahead.

The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks than the baseline model across all lead times.

The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission. What do these findings mean? While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict, particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool.

Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources.

Introduction Dengue is a mosquito-transmitted viral infection spread by Aedes mosquitoes in urban and peri-urban environments in tropical and subtropical countries [1–3]. About half of the global population is at risk of dengue transmission [4,5]. Dengue infection is characterised by flu-like symptoms that may include sudden intermittent high fever, retro-orbital pain, muscle and joint pain, severe headache, and widespread red skin rash. Its treatment typically includes the supportive care of symptoms. There is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue, and efforts to control transmission focus on controlling vector populations [6]. A live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine has demonstrated efficacy in 2 large-scale Phase III trials [7] and has now been licensed. However, while the vaccine shows high levels of protection against disease in people with previous exposure to dengue viruses, it may increase the risk of severe dengue if given to seronegative individuals [7]. A lack of reliable and scalable tests for seropositivity currently hinders wider rollout of the Dengvaxia vaccine and so most countries still primarily rely on insecticide-based mosquito control interventions to limit dengue virus transmission [8]. The increasing resistance to insecticides highlights the need for targeted and effective interventions [9]. Vietnam is particularly affected by dengue with an estimated burden of about 2 million yearly infections [5,10], although, on average, only 95,000 cases have been reported annually to the Ministry of Health over the period 2002 to 2020. Underreporting may be due to 2 main factors. First, dengue surveillance in Vietnam is mostly passive, relying on clinical cases reported by patients seeking healthcare [11]. Second, up to 80% of the cases may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and will likely not seek healthcare [12]. The economic impact of dengue in Vietnam is estimated to be US$30 to US$95 million per annum [10,13,14]. Dengue in Vietnam is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, by Aedes albopictus [15,16]. In Vietnam, dengue is characterised by strong seasonality and substantial interannual and spatial variability (S1 Fig). Dengue exhibits different behaviour in different parts of the country. In the north, where temperatures are lower than in the rest of the country, most provinces have few or no cases. An exception is Hanoi, which has reported, on average, about 8,700 dengue cases per year over the past 10 years. In central and southern provinces where temperatures are warmer, many provinces report thousands of cases annually, albeit with large interannual variation. Dengue control in the country primarily involves community engagement and mobilisation to reduce breeding sites and outdoor low-volume insecticide spraying in the vicinity of reported dengue cases to kill adult mosquitoes [11]. One limitation of dengue control measures is that they are essentially reactive, meaning they take place after cases have occurred. Thus, vector control, dengue diagnosis, and reporting all suffer delays which vary across time and space [17]. This situation hinders the timely generation and communication of information on when and where transmission occurs, limiting the ability of health professionals to plan and execute control measures. If accurate predictions are available, public health decision-makers and planners could design, implement, and target interventions to the most at-risk places in a timely fashion. Disease models driven by Earth observations have been valuable for predicting dengue risk ahead of time, supporting decision-making in multiple settings [18–20]. Climate variation is one of the main drivers of dengue ecology. It is known that temperature regulates the development, biting, reproduction rates, and the spatial distribution of Aedes mosquitoes [21–23]. The titre and replication of dengue viruses within mosquitoes is temperature dependent [21,24]. For example, rising temperatures increase dengue transmission to an optimum range of 26 to 29°C [25], and large diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs; above 20°C) reduce transmission and increase mosquito mortality [26]. Mosquito survival is also affected by humidity. Research indicated that A. aegypti eggs survive across a wide range of humidity and temperature combinations. However, Ae. albopictus eggs experience high mortality when relative humidity is lower than 95% if temperatures are above 22°C [27]. Under high humidity conditions (i.e., above 80%), adult mosquitoes survive and remain active by replenishing transient body fluid depletion with plant sugars and host blood [28]. This behaviour is also observed in lower humidity environments, although to a lesser extent [28]. The effect of precipitation on dengue is related to the creation or flush away of mosquito breeding sites [29]. The effects of wind speed have been seldom explored in the literature. However, research suggests that wind speed reduces the biting activity of mosquitoes, reducing dengue risk [30]. Most of the effects of climate on dengue incidence are delayed by 1 to 2 months due to their effect on the life cycle of both mosquitoes and the dengue virus [31]. Thus, the climatic conditions just before the transmission season starts may be indicative of dengue incidence in the following dengue transmission season [32,33]. Multiple studies have highlighted the potential usefulness of seasonal climate-driven epidemiological surveillance for decision-making and planning [32,34–36]. These studies have used subseasonal (i.e., between 2 weeks and 2 months ahead) forecasts to inform disease models and compute predictions of dengue risk. There has been limited progress in using subseasonal to seasonal climate forecasting to compute prospective forecasts on a routine basis. There are several challenges for implementing operational and sustainable subseasonal (henceforth seasonal) early warning systems [37]. Some of these challenges include the lack of multi-decadal health data sets with which to train and validate seasonal climate-driven early warning systems, the common mismatch of scales between climate data outputs and data used for decision-making, and a general lack of consensus as to how to communicate uncertainties to users [36]. Dengue early warning systems driven by Earth observations and seasonal climate forecasts have been proposed using a range of modelling approaches [38], including autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) [39], point forecasts [32,40], spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models [18,19], least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression [41,42], and machine learning [43]. Often, models are validated using block cross-validation to select the model specification with the lowest out-of-sample predictive error [18,32]. This approach takes advantage of all available data to make repeated out-of-sample model predictions, which increases the robustness of model adequacy and verification statistics. One drawback of this method is that it does not preserve the time ordering of the data. Also, predictions are computed for some time periods using a model trained on data from a later time period [44]. Previous dengue risk prediction studies have relied on outputs from 1 or 2 competing models [18,32]. However, combining forecasts from multiple competing models into a superensemble may result in more accurate predictions than those from any individual model [38,45]. The use of model superensembles for the development of dengue early warning systems has been seldom explored. Moreover, predictions are typically made for a selected year or month [18,32,34] rather than for a series of lead times into the future, or a whole season [19,41]. In some cases, systems are designed exclusively for research purposes in isolation from relevant stakeholders who may become potential users. This situation is partly due to the difficulties related to the integration of these systems into existing public health procedures and occasional lack of technical expertise. Typically, dengue early warning systems are based on deterministic models [32,39,40] which may underrepresent heterogeneity and stochastic cessation of transmission. However, decision-makers are increasingly interested in understanding the uncertainties related to the models used to develop decision-support tools and in the probabilities that an event of public health concern may or may not take place [34,46,47]. Spatiotemporal probabilistic models have the advantage of being able to quantify the probability that an event (e.g., an outbreak) may occur at specific times and for specific locations. Public health officials may be more inclined to take action if the probability of observing an outbreak exceeds a certain value [18]. Both modellers and decision-makers should pay attention to and agree on the definition of outbreaks thresholds so that model predictions are a useful guide for planning and decision-making. In several countries, including Vietnam, outbreaks are defined using a so-called endemic channel [48,49], which corresponds to the mean number of cases per month or season over a long-term period [50]. In Vietnam, endemic channels are defined for each province using the last 5 years of dengue surveillance data. Outbreak years are removed from the computation of the endemic threshold. When dengue cases exceed the mean plus 2 standard deviations, an outbreak is declared. One limitation of this approach is that often, outbreak years are removed arbitrarily or quasi-quantitatively to increase the sensitivity of the outbreak threshold [50]. In areas where dengue incidence is typically low (e.g., less than 10 cases per month), the endemic channel may be frequently exceeded, generating statistical alarms of little public health importance [51]. Despite these limitations, endemic channels are widely used for dengue control decision-making in a variety of countries and provide a practical decision point around which forecasts can be targeted [52,53]. Here, we introduce a superensemble of probabilistic spatiotemporal hierarchical dengue models driven by Earth observations and seasonal climate forecasts. The model framework was codesigned with stakeholders from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, the Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City, the Pasteur Institute Nha Trang, the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Tay Nguyen (TIHE), and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE). The system is designed to generate monthly estimates of dengue risk across Vietnam (331,210 km2) at the province level (n = 63) in near-real time (i.e., current time minus processing time). The superensemble is used in an expanding window time series cross-validation (TSCV) framework [54] to generate probabilistic dengue forecasts, which allow us to calculate the probability of exceeding predefined dengue outbreak thresholds for a forecast horizon (i.e., lead time) of 1 to 6 months. The superensemble constitutes the dengue fever component of a forecasting system called D-MOSS (i.e., Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System). The system operates using a suite of Earth observation data sources from satellites and has its first implementation in Vietnam. Vietnam is divided into 63 provinces which are subdivided into 713 districts and has an estimated population of 95.5 million people. The D-MOSS system produces results at the province level and is accompanied by an assessment of its predictive ability that is applied consistently across the whole of Vietnam. The intention is to give an overall evaluation of the performance of our method, rather than an assessment that pertains to the characteristics of any particular province.

Materials and methods The analysis plan was described in a UK Space Agency grant proposal for the International Partnership Programme in September 2017. The aims, objectives, and proposed methodology were developed prior to data analysis and are described in S1 Text. Changes to the analytical plan in response to suggestions from reviewers took place between August and October 2020. These changes include (1) calculating the bias and sharpness of each of the competing models included in the superensemble to decompose the overall prediction error; (2) formulating a climate naïve baseline model that captures the spatial dependency and seasonality for each province and estimates the same seasonal average of dengue incidence each month; (3) modifying the model superensemble specification from Bayesian moving averaging to model stacking based on the continuous rank probability score (CRPS); (4) using weights based on the variance of errors rather than maximum likelihood; and (5) modifying the colour palette and the methodology used for communicating and visualising the outputs from the probabilistic superensemble. Our study did not require a separate ethical approval. Dengue surveillance data Monthly dengue cases were obtained from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Data were retrieved for the period August 2002 to December 2019 at the province level (n = 63). Data comprised suspected and confirmed dengue cases, although there was no indication as to how many cases fell within each category. The data set did not contain serotype-specific information. According to the national guidelines on dengue surveillance, suspected cases are defined as people living in or coming from endemic areas or from areas that have had dengue outbreak foci over the previous 14 days with manifestation of sudden high fever lasting for 2 to 7 days and with at least 2 of the following signs: hemorrhagic manifestation (positive tourniquet test, hypodermic petechiae or ecchymosis, and stump hemorrhage or nasal hemorrhage), headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, skin flush, rash, muscular, joint and orbital pains, writhe, unconsciousness, pain in liver area or pain when pressing on the liver area, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, or increased hematocrit. Confirmed cases correspond to those confirmed by laboratory tests using MAC-ELISA, PCR, and NS1, or virus isolation. Over the period 2002 to 2019, there have been no changes in the classification of suspected and confirmed dengue cases in Vietnam. Historical demographic and land cover data Total population per province and per year were retrieved from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) Gridded Population of the World project version 4.11 [55] at a 1 km2 resolution, 5 yearly for the period 2000 to 2020. Intervening years were generated using linear interpolation. The percentage of urban, peri-urban, and rural land cover per province and per year for the period 2002 to 2019 was derived from the ESA CCI Land Cover project [56,57], which describes the land surface into 22 classes at a spatial resolution of 0.00277 degrees. Historical Earth observation data Minimum, maximum, and mean air temperature at 2 metres above ground (°C) were derived from MODIS daily L3 global land surface temperature products [58] with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. Precipitation amount per day (mm day−1) was initially retrieved from from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission [59] at a spatial resolution of 25 km2 up to April 2014. After April 2014, precipitation data were obtained from the Global Precipitation Mission [60] at a spatial resolution of 10 km2. Daytime-specific surface humidity (dimensionless) was calculated using the daytime MODIS L2 water vapour near infrared MOD 5 products [61] with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. Average daily wind speed at 10 metres above ground (m s−1) was retrieved from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-5 reanalysis [57] for the period 2002 to 2011, at a spatial resolution of 31 km2. After 2011, wind speed data were obtained from the NOAA Climate Forecast System [62] at a 20 km2 resolution. Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies for the Niño region 3.4 (5°S−−5°N and 170°−120°W) were obtained from the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction Climate Prediction Center [63] for the period 2002 to 2020. Earth observation data were obtained as a gridded data set in netcdf format. Sociodemographic data were averaged at the province level using the rasterstats module in Python 3.6 [64]. When a polygon covered only part of a grid cell, averages were calculated for the approximate fraction of the cell covered by the polygon (rounded 1/100). The administrative boundaries of each province were defined using a shapefile provided by the Vietnamese General Department of Preventive Medicine, Hanoi. Climate data were aggregated at the province level using population weighted averages for each month. SEDAC population data, although gridded, had identical values at each pixel falling within a given administrative district (i.e., admin 2 level). SEDAC data could not be used for the computation of population weighted averages as each grid cell within an administrative district would carry the same weight. As a compromise, we used WorldPop [65] estimates for which population estimates vary per pixel. Population data from the WorldPop project [65] at a 100 m2 spatial resolution was used to calculate annual gridded weights for each province using the rasterstats module in Python 3.6 [64]. At the time of processing, WorldPop data were only available for the years 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2020. Intervening years were calculated using linear interpolation. Province-specific population-weighted averages were calculated as follows: (1) where n is the total number of pixels i falling within a given province polygon, x is the value of each climate predictor at pixel i, and w denotes the pixel-specific weights calculated as (2) where p i is the pixel-specific population count, and N is the total population count falling into a given province. There were multiple changes in the administrative boundaries of the provinces over the study period. The last change took place in 2008. Consequently, we froze the administrative boundaries of the country at their 2008 level. Dengue data were allocated to each of the 2008 level administrative boundaries using district-level records. The allocation of dengue cases to each province was conducted by the General Department of Preventive Medicine, Hanoi. Seasonal climate forecasts Seasonal climate forecasts of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, daily precipitation, specific humidity, wind speed, and sea surface temperature anomalies for the Niño region 3.4 were obtained from the UK Met Office Global Seasonal Forecasting System version 5 (GloSea5) [66,67]. GloSea5 comprises 42 ensemble members built around a high-resolution climate prediction model (HadGEM3). Ensemble members differ due to small stochastic physics perturbations provided by the Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter v2 [68]. GloSea5 has a resolution of 0.83 degrees in latitude and 0.56 degrees in longitude for the atmosphere and 0.25 × 0.25 degrees for the ocean. GloSea5 has 2 major components, the forecast itself and the associated hindcasts or historical re-forecasts, which are used for calibration and assessment. An evaluation of the predictive ability of the GloSea5 system can be found elsewhere [66]. S2 Fig shows that compared to the climatology (i.e., the month-specific mean for each variable), the out-of-sample errors of the GloSea5 system are considerably low. Seasonal climate hindcasts Hindcast data (i.e., historical forecasts) from the GloSea5 system [66,67] were retrieved using the Copernicus Climate Data Store [57] at monthly time steps for each of the 28 ensemble members, for lead times of 1 to 6 months ahead, and for the period January 2007 to December 2016. At the time of the computations, data for the period May to October 2016 were unavailable from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. Model specification Let Y i,t be the number of dengue cases for province i = 1, ⋯, I and time t = 1, ⋯, T where I is the total number of provinces in the data set, and T is the total number of time steps for which the model is fitted using Bayesian generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). Models were fitted with a conditional negative binomial distribution given the number of dengue cases in the previous time step. The general algebraic definition of the models at the linear predictor scale is given by (3) where α corresponds to the intercept; log (P i,a[t] ) denotes the logarithm of the population at risk for province i and year a[t], included as an offset to adjust case counts by population; log (Y i,t−1 +1) denotes the logarithm of the observed number of dengue cases in the previous month plus one with an autoregressive parameter ρ; X is a matrix of k seasonal meteorological explanatory variables with regression coefficients β; and L j,a[t] is a matrix of j land cover (peri-urban and urban) variables with regression coefficients ϵ. Long-term trends are modelled using province-specific unstructured random effects for each year (γ i,a[t] ). Seasonality is accounted for by using province-specific structured random effects for each calendar month (δ i,m[t] ) with first order autoregressive prior to allow each month to depend on the previous one. Unknown confounding factors, such as interventions and spatial dependency structures representing, for example, human mobility, were incorporated using structured (ν i ) and unstructured (u i ) random effects for each province i. Spatial random effects were specified using a Besag–York–Mollie model [69], which incorporates a spatial effect with a Gaussian exchangeable prior to account for unstructured variation and a spatial effect with an intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior to account for spatially structured variability. Delayed effects of meteorological factors on dengue were accounted for by incorporating a 3-month moving average of temperature, precipitation, specific humidity, and DTR centred at lag of 1 month (i.e., each value is given the average of lag 0 to a lag of 2 months). Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño region 3.4 were lagged 0 to 3 months based on previous research [20,33,70] and exploratory analyses. No delayed effects were considered for wind speed based on previous studies, indicating a highest effect of wind at a lag of 0 months [71]. Flat priors were set to regression coefficients (α,ρ,β), and penalising complexity priors were assumed for the precision for all random effects [72]. Priors were specified using a Gaussian distribution. We did not explicitly specify a prior distribution for the dispersion parameter (ϕ). We used the default pc.gamma specification in the INLA R package [73], which assumes a Gamma distribution with values of ϕ within the interval 1–5668.2. Models were fitted in R version 3.6.1 using the INLA package [73]. The relevant R code is available at https://github.com/FelipeJColon/paper_dengue_superensemble. Model selection The best subset of seasonal climate predictors leading to the lowest observed prediction discrepancies for a given model was obtained using an expanding window TSCV algorithm [54]. Land cover variables were included in all competing models as they varied annually and are unlikely to change significantly at monthly time steps. We iteratively fitted all possible models containing 1 seasonal climate predictor at the time, then 2 seasonal climate predictors, and so on, until all seasonal climate variables were included in a full model [20]. Thus, we tested 128 unique model specifications across 114 forecast months (i.e., January 2007 to December 2016). The predictive ability of each model was evaluated using the CRPS which generalises the mean absolute error for the case of probabilistic forecasts. The advantage of the CRPS compared to the mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) is that the CPRS does not focus on a specific point of the probability distribution of the forecasts, but on their distribution as a whole. CRPS values were computed in R using the SpecsVerification package [74]. In response to peer review comments, we also evaluated the bias of the forecasts with the lowest CRPS to investigate whether models systematically over- or underpredicted dengue counts [75]. The bias for a continuous forecast at time t was defined as [76] (4) where P t is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the prediction for the true value x t [75]. Bias values range from −1 to 1, with B t = 0 as an ideal value. The sharpness of the best performing models was assessed to investigate their ability to generate predictions within a narrow range [75]. The sharpness of forecasts at time t was defined using the normalised median absolute deviation about the median (MADN) [75,76]. We defined sharpness as (5) where y is a forecast with cumulative distribution function P t ; the division by 0.675 ensures a value equivalent to the standard deviation if the predictive distribution is normal [75]. Sharpest models have S t = 0, while blurred forecasts have S t →∞ [75]. Bias and sharpness were calculated using the scoringutils [76] R package. TSCV was implemented using an expanding window approach dividing the data set into multiple training and testing sets. The initial training set comprised data from August 2002 to December 2006. Each time step (k), a further month of data was added to the training set until the training set contained n-6 observations, where n is the total number of observations in the set. The testing set comprised the climate hindcast data for the 6 months immediately after the last observation in the training set for each geographical area. Seasonal climate hindcast data were used to simulate the behaviour of an operational system over the period 2007 to 2016. We calculated the mean CRPS for each model specification across all time steps and ensemble members. The best 5 performing models were selected to create a superensemble. Prospective lagged dengue cases The number of dengue cases occurring at time t is directly dependent on the number of cases that occurred in the recent past. Previous research suggests that including the logarithm of the number of cases in the previous month log(Y t−1 ) helps accounting for such temporal correlation in disease transmission [77]. Additionally, incorporating log(Y t−1 ) as a covariate improves the predictive ability of seasonal climate-informed disease models by reducing residual dispersion [77]. One complication of accounting for the number of cases in the previous month in an operational system is that log(Y t−1 ) in the temporal window of the forecast can only be known up to time t+1. More specifically, to generate dengue forecasts 1 month ahead, log(Y t−1 ) for time t+1 corresponds to the logarithm of the number of dengue cases at time t. We used a GLMM with a negative binomial specification to estimate the log(Y i,t−1 ) for time t+1 to time t+6 to ensure that the number of cases in the previous month were exactly the same for all competing models. Thus, reconstructed lagged dengue time series was exactly the same for all models. The algebraic definition of the model is (6) with α as the intercept; log (P i,a[t] ) as the population at risk in province i at time a[t], included as an offset; log (Y i,t−1 +1) is the logarithm of the observed dengue cases plus one in the previous month with regression coefficient ρ; γ i,a[t] as province-specific unstructured yearly random effect; δ i,m[t] as province-specific structured monthly random effect with an AR1 auto-correlation term; and u i and ν i as province-specific structured and unstructured random effects. We then predicted the number of dengue cases for time t+1. The logarithm of the predicted number of cases at time t+1 was then used as log(Y i,t−1 ) for time t+2. We repeated these steps for each lead time in the forecast until time t+6. Note we assumed a conditional negative binomial distribution to generate one-step-ahead point predictions for the reconstructed lagged dengue time series. Once the reconstructed lagged dengue time series was complete, we fitted all competing models as indicated in the Model selection section. Baseline model We developed a historical baseline model, which forecasts the same seasonal average of dengue incidence every month at each model run following [18,34,78] to compare all models to a common reference. The baseline model is specified as follows: (7) where α is the intercept; log (P i,a[t] ) is the population at risk in province i at time a[t], included as an offset; δ i,m[t] are province-specific monthly structured random effects with an AR1 auto-correlation term; and u i and ν i as province-specific structured and unstructured random effects. We compared the predictive ability of the superensemble to that of the baseline model using the continuous rank probability skill score (CRPSS). The CRPSS is defined as follows: (8) where CRPS f is the CRPS value of the forecast, and CRPS b is the corresponding CRPS value of the baseline model. Model superensemble Given a number of competing models, we generated a model superensemble [38] stacking models according to their CRPS following suggestions from peer reviewers. Stacking involves averaging predictions from multiple models using weighted averages. We found model stacking outperformed Bayesian moving average. Therefore, this technique was adopted for the final version of the system. Stacking was performed in 3 stages [79]. On the first stage, we simulated 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of dengue cases for each of the best performing models and the baseline model. Then, we calculated their CRPS for the historical period comparing the samples against observed dengue counts. In the second stage, optimal weights [80,81] were calculated for each model as follows: (9) where V is the variance represented by the square of the CRPS of the ith forecast errors. A new set of weights were computed each time a forecast was issued using training data from all previous years. On the last stage, the 1,000 samples were combined using a weighted average. We then calculated the 2.5th, 50th, and 9.75th percentiles of their distribution. Outbreak detection evaluation The predictive ability of the model for outbreak detection was evaluated using the Brier score [82]. For the Brier score, smaller values indicate better predictions. Four moving outbreak thresholds were defined to evaluate the predictive ability of the superensemble for outbreak prediction: (i) the endemic channel plus 1 standard deviation; (ii) the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations; (iii) the 75th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month; and (iv) the 95th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month. The endemic channel was calculated as the number of dengue cases per month and per province over the previous 5 years in agreement with current practice at the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The 75th and 95th percentiles were calculated over the whole observational period at each time step. We then calculated the probability of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold generating 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the point forecasts to reflect forecast uncertainty. The Brier score was calculated as follows: (10) where N is the number of predictions; f t is the forecast probability that an outbreak may happen; and O t takes the value of 1 if there was an outbreak or 0 if there was no outbreak. Brier scores were computed in R using the scoring package [83]. Public health officials may be more likely to take preventive action if the probability of observing an outbreak exceeds a certain value [18]. We undertook a signal detection analysis to determine the ability of the forecast probabilities to classify the predicted number of dengue cases as outbreaks. There are 4 possible outcomes in this analysis: hit (true positive), correct rejection (true negative), false alarm (false positive), and missed (false negative). A count for each of the 4 possible outcomes was produced. Relative value of using a forecasting system Unlike other measures, the relative value (V) of the forecasts generated by the superensemble depends on requirements set by the user [84]. Typically, V is evaluated in monetary terms and is particularly useful when the probability of occurrence of an adverse event (e.g., a major outbreak) is known. If the probability of occurrence of an outbreak is greater than the ratio of the cost of taking preventive action divided by the loss incurred by not taking action (C/L ratio) and an outbreak occurs, then it will pay off to take action. If the probability of occurrence of an outbreak is lower than the C/L ratio, then it does not pay off to take preventive action. If the probability is equal to the C/L ratio, it does not matter if action is taken or not. Our analysis provides an initial screening process to identify areas where a forecast is most likely to be cost-effective and thus, target of comprehensive economic evaluation studies in the future. Given that data on the cost of taking preventive action and on the losses incurred by not taking action were unknown to us at the time of writing this manuscript, V was estimated for a range of theoretical C/L ratios following [84] by comparing the mean cost of using the forecasting system for outbreak detection compared to the mean expense incurred by either never preventing outbreaks or, on the contrary, taking preventive action every month of the year. V takes a value of 1 if the forecast is perfect and a value of 0 if it is no better than the default action plan. If V is negative, it indicates that the forecast is so poor that it would be more cost effective not to use it. The algebraic definition of V is (11) where E(S) is the theoretical expense incurred by taking preventive action each month or the losses incurred by no taking action at all even when an outbreak occurred, whichever is the least expensive method when not using the forecast; E(A) represents the total cost of the forecast calculated as the cost of type 1 (false positive) and type 2 (false negative) errors plus the cost of acting when an outbreak was predicted and it occurred (true positive); and E(P) indicates the cost incurred with a perfect forecast where outputs are exclusively true positives and true negatives.

Discussion This study details a probabilistic dengue early warning system based on a model superensemble, formulated using Earth observations and driven by seasonal climate forecasts. The system is able to generate accurate probabilistic forecasts of dengue metrics that have the potential for guiding policy- and decision-making processes in Vietnam. We make predictions for each of the 28 ensemble members of the seasonal climate forecast and generate 1,000 samples from the posterior distribution of the predicted number of cases. Deciding which predictive model is the best from a suite of competing models is not a straightforward task. Each model carries somewhat different information of the modelled processes. Here, we present a method for reconciling between-model disagreements while improving forecast accuracy. The combination of models into a superensemble helps offset individual model biases across time and space [86]. Superensembles were initially developed for climate modelling [87] and have gradually gained popularity in disease modelling (see, for example, [38,45,88]). Our novel dengue early warning system relies on probabilistic models to reflect forecast uncertainty and to explicitly assign probabilities to outcomes [89]. The system has been developed to aid policy- and decision-making processes in Vietnam with the guidance of key stakeholders in the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, WHO regional office, the Pasteur Institutes in Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh, Province-level Ministries of Health, the Vietnamese NIHE, and the Tay Nguyen Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. A range of stakeholder engagement workshops, face-to-face meetings with users, and surveys were conducted to tailor the system to the users’ needs. Our results demonstrate that the forecasts generated by our spatiotemporal superensemble have the potential to guide changes to the current practice in dengue control towards a more preventative approach allowing bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources. Research on use of the system by stakeholders and its effect on changing dengue control practices is currently ongoing. We demonstrate that the superensemble slightly outperforms the predictive ability of the individual probabilistic models selected from a suite of top performing models at multiple lead times and months of the year in line with previous research [38,45,87,88]. Compared to a baseline model that predicts the same dengue incidence rate for each season and province, the superensemble generated more accurate predictions at lead times of 1 to 3 months but not beyond. Model performance was assessed using a range of verification metrics for probabilistic forecasts across time and space. To our knowledge, this is one of the first early warning systems informed by Earth observations to demonstrate predictive ability for prospective year-round dengue prediction in a robust out-of-sample framework. It is also one of the first prototypes for routine dengue early warning at multiple time leads. We found that the performance of the superensemble varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year. The system showed ability in predicting spatiotemporal variations in dengue cases and outbreak occurrence at forecast horizons of up to 6 months ahead. Predictions deteriorated, and uncertainty increased with lead time, as previously observed in other settings and diseases [36,42,75,90]. Forecasts improved, and the credible intervals decreased as time progressed and dengue data increased, likely due to an improvement in the associations learned by the superensemble. Forecast errors increased for the onset and peak of the transmission season, possibly due to substantial interannual variation (S6 Fig). Relative to a baseline model, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions of the estimated number of dengue cases across most provinces, at lead times of 1 to 3 months in agreement with previous studies [18,42,45]. At lead times beyond 3 months, however, the baseline model made more accurate predictions possibly because, as suggested by [45], incorporating seasonal climate data into predictive models may increase model complexity at the expense of lower out-of-sample predictive ability. Previous research has found that climate naïve models may outperform climate-informed models [32,45]. Those studies, however, used different sources of climate and environmental data than our study and were conducted in different settings (i.e., Thailand, Peru, and Puerto Rico) where the effects of climate might be significantly different to those observed in Vietnam. In addition, those studies initialised their prospective forecasts at fixed times of the year, whereas our study initialised forecasts at each calendar month, providing the model with more opportunities to learn the relationships between dengue incidence and each of the climatic and sociodemographic predictors. Outbreaks are difficult to predict, even more so at forecast horizons of several months ahead. Nevertheless, our superensemble demonstrated predictive ability for outbreak detection up to a lead time of 6 months, evaluated using proper scores over a suite of moving outbreak thresholds. One of the best performing outbreak thresholds was the endemic channel plus 2 standard deviations, computed using data from the previous 5 years. This method is currently in use across Vietnam [48,49], although with the difference of excluding outbreak years from the computation of the threshold. Following our results, however, we recommend the use of the 95th percentile as a threshold for outbreak detection as it gave slightly better results for detecting outbreaks. Recognising the limitations of the province-level data, it is encouraging that our predictions are accurate in most provinces up to 6 months in advance. In disease forecasting, each decision (e.g., to prevent or not to prevent an outbreak) has an associated cost that will lead to a benefit or a loss depending on the outcome. Decision-makers have the task of selecting the action that minimises potential losses. We used a simple analysis [84] to assess the relative value of the forecasts generated by the superensemble. Our figures are only illustrative. Still, they highlight that using a dengue early warning system has relative value compared to not using a forecast. The superensemble had considerable value across most provinces. However, in northern provinces, where dengue is essentially absent, the forecast is predicted to have limited relative value compared to always preparing for an outbreak or never preparing for it. The assessment of the relative value of the dengue early warning system may help stakeholders justify public investment in the development and generation of seasonal forecasts or to help raise awareness of their potential value. Although our proposed early warning system provides useful information for public health preparedness and response, it has some limitations worth mentioning. First, while our modelling framework incorporates important determinants of dengue occurrence such as climate and urbanisation, it does not explicitly incorporate, at this stage, the potential effects of other important determinants of disease such as the deployment of mosquito control interventions, vector indices, serotype-specific circulation, herd immunity, and the mobility of people and goods, all of which may lead to significant changes in the level of risk experienced locally [91]. Stakeholders in Vietnam have recently started collecting supporting data on vector indices and dengue virus serotypes. However, there is a lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets that could be used to inform modelling efforts. In this study, we account for some of the variation that might be attributed to these factors by using spatiotemporal random effects in each of the models included in the superensemble. Future developments of the system may incorporate some of these factors if data are made available. Second, the quality and consistency of the dengue data are affected by the limited confirmation of suspected cases through laboratory diagnostic test, leading to large uncertainties that are difficult to quantify. Third, our computations of dengue risk do not take into consideration uncertainties due to the potential under- or misreporting of dengue cases. Consequently, our model superensemble forecasts may underestimate the real number of cases occurring at any given time. Finally, our forecasts do not carry forward the uncertainty of the one-step-ahead forecasts used to simulate prospective lagged cases. Future developments may represent this uncertainty more accurately by using simulation-based path forecasts in a Bayesian framework [92].

Conclusions We have demonstrated that a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models, formulated using Earth observations and driven by seasonal climate forecasts and a reconstructed/prospective estimate of lagged dengue cases, is useful to generate probabilistic predictions of dengue risk across Vietnam at multiple lead times and months of the year. We acknowledge that there are alternative state-of-the-art approaches to dengue forecasting that may be equally as effective as the one presented here. However, our aim was to develop a system that outperformed previous practice in Vietnam where no forecasting system was used to guide decision-making processes. A theoretical analysis showed that compared to not using a forecasting system, the superensemble has relative value across most of the country, suggesting that it has potential for guiding decision-making processes. The dengue forecasting system presented here has been rolled out across Vietnam and could be tailored for other dengue-endemic countries. Further work may include investigating the feasibility of producing probabilistic forecasts with sufficient predictive ability at the district or commune levels and a comparison with other statistical and mechanistic approaches.

The first case had presented with symptoms of dengue fever, and after 5 days of admission he developed symptoms of COVID-19. The second case was admitted with mild COVID-19, and during the course of illness, in view of mild hemoconcentration and progressive decline in leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, he was tested positive for dengue fever. In coinfections, one virus can suppress or augment the other, leading to varying clinical manifestations of the diseases.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe, including areas where other tropical diseases are endemic such as the Maldives [6, 8,9,10, 15]. Clinicians are challenged with the additional burden of possible coinfections with other tropical diseases that have the potential to complicate the course of illness [26]. Coinfections with COVID-19 have been reported with multiple bacteria and viruses [27,28,29,30,31]. Nevertheless, coinfection with dengue viruses and SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce, with only a few reports describing false-positive dengue serology [24, 32]. The healthcare system of the Maldives is stretched and may not respond adequately to a dual outbreak because of limited manpower and infrastructure [33]. Every year, the Maldives experiences a dengue outbreak during the monsoons. From the year 2011, an average of 1543 cases have been reported annually [15]. In 2018, 3494 cases were reported, and in 2019, 5023 cases were reported, which was a record number for the Maldives [34]. Despite an expected increase in cases, so far only 225 cases have been reported, while dengue cases are on the rise in other endemic regions [34, 35]. We postulate that healthcare providers are more focused on COVID-19, which has resulted in lower rates of testing or reporting of dengue virus. In addition, individuals with mild symptomatic dengue infections perhaps are not visiting hospitals because of the pandemic and lockdowns. COVID-19 may present as an undifferentiated acute febrile illness [36]. In one study, 87.9% of COVID-19 patients presented with fever, 67.7% presented with cough, and 13.7% of patients had headache [37]. Nevertheless, information regarding the frequency of fever in dengue infection is limited in most prospective studies, mostly due to confounders within the study designs where fever remains an inclusion criterion. Fever can be absent in the elderly population or, if present, can occur over 90% of the time [38]. Cough in dengue infection has been reported in 67% of cases, which can be due to pleural effusion observed during plasma leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [39, 40]. Headache in dengue infection has been reported in 89% of cases and more commonly in DHF [41]. Bleeding in COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with morbidity, but frequency of bleeding manifestations in COVID-19 remains low [42]. In contrast, bleeding in dengue infection occurs more frequently and is associated with increasing severity [41]. The hematological profile in COVID-19 and dengue infection are similar. Neutrophils are increased early in both infections with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The discrepancy in the hematological profile in both infections is lymphopenia, which is observed in COVID-19 during the course of illness in contrast to a reverse neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in dengue infection. Transaminitis is observed in both infections; however, the expression of aspartate aminotransferase is greater than alanine transaminase in dengue infection [43, 44]. Our first case was initially diagnosed as dengue fever with warning signs, and COVID-19 was detected during the screening process before admission [45]. On day 5 of admission, he developed a non-productive cough and sore throat that could be attributed to COVID-19. The cough could also be due to dengue-related pleural effusion, which was not evident on his chest X-ray in posterior–anterior view. However, a chest X-ray in lateral decubitus view is more sensitive to detect minimal effusion [46]. In our second case, the patient was admitted with a diagnosis of mild COVID-19. With a depleting trend of leukocytes and platelets, dengue serology was performed, which was positive. Case 1 had a hemoconcentration of 19% and gall bladder wall edema suggestive of plasma leakage [47]. As there was no bleeding manifestation, this case was classified as DHF grade 1 [48]. In case 1, liver biochemistry revealed an atypical profile with alanine transaminase expression greater than that of aspartate aminotransferase, which may be due to coinfection. However, initially in case 2, we observed mild transaminitis with an elevation of aspartate aminotransferase expression compared with that of alanine transaminase, which is consistent with dengue infection. Case 2 had leukopenia, which may be seen in both infections, which started to improve on day 3 of admission. In both cases, NS1 was negative, which could have been due to the late presentation. Treatment was mainly symptomatic. Intravenous fluid was avoided as COVID-19 patients are more prone to develop pulmonary edema [49]. Coinfections of two viruses can reduce or augment disease severity [50]. The most common outcome is viral interference, where one virus competitively suppresses the replication of the other [51]. This could have played an important role in changing the dynamics of dengue virus infection and the natural history of the disease. This could explain the two cases failing to demonstrate the typical features of dengue infection, both in its disease progression and the laboratory findings. More data are required to determine the changing dynamics of coinfection of the dengue virus with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, clinicians should use commercially available dengue serology judiciously with growing evidence of cross-reaction with other flaviviruses [52]. Limitations in this report include the inability to utilize the gold standard to diagnose dengue infection either by virus isolation or RT-PCR. In addition to this, dengue serotyping was also not done, which could have provided valuable information regarding virulence and disease dynamics."

The 'dengue belt' stretches around much of the planet crossing continents, cultures and time zones, a vast region linked by a common fate: a mosquito-borne disease that can be prevented for a select number of people with a somewhat quirky vaccine. Dengue, however, remains a source of misery for many, a viral infection without an antiviral to treat it.

The need for an antiviral is enormous. Forty percent of the world's population—about 3 billion people—resides in regions at risk of dengue infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each year up to 400 million people are infected, 100 million get seriously sick and 22,000 die of severe dengue.

Scientists are increasingly conducting what once was an arduous task of finding ""a needle in a haystack,"" pinpointing a compound from an existing archive of thousands of compounds. The reason for such hunts is to find a compound capable of treating any given disease. In general, so-called 'big data' scans are allowing hunts through massive libraries of chemical data. This type of search has been mounted to uncover a compound to treat dengue, and a discovery by one research group has already begun to produce positive results.

""Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that lacks any effective antiviral treatments,"" wrote Dr. Stephanie A. Moquin, first author on a research paper about a big data hunt for a dengue antiviral. The research, conducted by a team from the Novartis pharmaceutical company, was published in Science Translational Medicine.

""There are four serotypes of dengue virus, all of which can cause disease, including dengue fever, dengue shock syndrome [and] dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thus, an antiviral drug needs to be effective against all four serotypes,"" according to Moquin and her colleagues.

Although a vaccine was approved in 2019 to prevent infection, it remains of limited use. The inoculation is prescribed only for people between the ages of nine and 45 and it can be administered only to those who previously were infected. Worse, the vaccine has the dubious reputation of causing severe disease in some people. That's one reason that scientists have been on the hunt for an antiviral capable of effectively treating the infection.

An efficacious antiviral would be immediately welcomed into the pharmaceutical armamentarium. The mosquito-transmitted virus can cause an excruciatingly painful constellation of symptoms—a disease marked by soaring fever, headache, swollen glands and an indescribable amount of pain in the joints. It's no accident that ages ago the viral disease was widely known as breakbone fever.

Moquin and her team hail mostly from the global laboratories and research centers of the pharmaceutical giant, which is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. Although Novartis experts dominated the hunt for a dengue antiviral, they were aided by the Institute of Antiviral Research at the University of Utah. Novartis team members were scattered all over the United States—California, New Jersey and Massachusetts, and they collaborated with colleagues at the Novartis Institute for Tropical Medicine Research in Singapore.

The team had at their disposal—and used as their primary source—the vast Novartis compound library, which afforded a staggering number of details about potential candidates. Similar searches in recent months have involved the compound libraries of other pharmaceutical companies as scientists have searched for potential medications that can be re-purposed to treat COVID-19. Such searches are not new to pharmaceutical drug development, and increasingly have been used in the hunt for medications to address a wide range of conditions: antibiotic resistance, cancer and heart disease, for example. The hunts also can include searches of shelved and forgotten compounds from other eras.

Scientists search the libraries of chemical compounds for potential drugs that can keenly attack specific disease-causing targets.

""We performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen using the Novartis compound library and identified candidate chemical inhibitors of dengue virus,"" Moquin reported. ""This chemical series was optimized to improve properties such as anti-dengue virus potency and solubility. ""The lead compound, NITD-688, showed strong potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus and demonstrated excellent oral efficacy in infected AG129 mice.""

AG129 mice are deficient in alpha, beta and gamma interferon receptor-signaling. Interferons are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of viruses. Generally, a virus-infected cell releases interferons—chemical messengers—that cause neighboring cells to bolster their defenses. AG129 mice are commonly used in dengue research.

What scientists found in the small animal tests was surprising—a substantial reduction in viremia when mice were treated orally at 30 milligrams per kilogram twice daily for 3 days starting at the time of infection. Viremia is the amount of virus in the bloodstream. Treatment with the compound, NITD-688, also resulted in further viremia reduction when mice were treated again 48 hours after infection.

To test their hypothesis that NITD-688 may indeed be a potent antiviral with a high level of specificity for all four serotypes of the dengue virus, the team additionally tested the compound in laboratory rats and dogs, and additionally found the compound to be well-tolerated and produced a sharp decline in viremia.

The compound works against the virus because it inhibits the activity of a key dengue virus protein: NS4B. That molecule is vital to the dengue virus's replication complex, and therefore essential to the viral life cycle. NS4B works in tandem with another viral protein, NS4A. But with NS4B disabled by the newly identified compound, the pair can no longer perform their jobs maintaining vital functions of the virus.

Dengue viruses are spread by two mosquito species that are common throughout many parts of the world, and especially in the dengue belt. Aedes aegypti, for example, originated in Africa, but is found around the globe, including throughout much of the United States, according to the CDC. Aedes albopictus is the other mosquito carrier of dengue viruses. It too, is found globally. In addition to dengue, the same two mosquito species transmit Zika and chikungunya viruses.

The ongoing concern about these mosquitoes—flying hypodermic needles—is that their range throughout the dengue belt is where they do considerable harm. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas that are at risk. The belt covers Central America and the Caribbean, most of South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and South East Asia, according to the World Health Organization.

So far, the future looks bright for the drug candidate, NITD-688. ""Pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs showed a long elimination half-life and good oral bioavailability,"" Moquin wrote. ""Extensive in vitro safety profiling along with exploratory rat and dog toxicology studies showed that NITD-688 was well tolerated after 7-day repeat dosing, demonstrating that NITD-688 may be a promising preclinical candidate for the treatment of dengue.""

However, the effects of climate change-related weather anomalies on mosquito populations is not well understood. A study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases by Cameron Nosrat at Stanford University, United States and colleagues suggests that early interventions may prevent disease transmission even as extreme climate events may increase the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations.

Temperature and rainfall have significant impacts on Ae. aegypti abundance, and climate change will likely intensify the frequency of extreme climate events such as floods, droughts, heat waves and cold waves. To better understand the specific effects of weather anomalies on the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission, researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of dengue infections in Kenya. Using satellite-derived climate data, the authors classified extreme climate events rainfall and temperatures as in the upper or lower 10% of historical averages. The researchers then monitored Aedes aegypti abundance using trapping methods and new dengue fever cases via blood samples collected from a cohort of 7,653 children.

Flood seasons contributed to significantly higher Ae. aegypti egg and adult abundance. However, extreme climate events and greater Ae. aegypti abundance did not correlate to an increased number of confirmed dengue fever cases. Human behaviors can modify the relationship between mosquito abundance and disease transmission, and influence infection risk. Preventative measures in the study sites may have contributed to reductions in dengue transmission. A major limitation of the study was the lack of long-term Kenya climate data; however, the authors believe their study effectively examines the influence of weather anomalies on various life stages of Ae. aegypti abundance.

According to the authors, ""Dengue is the fastest-growing mosquito-borne disease in the world, and as climate change accelerates, many vulnerable populations will continue to be disproportionately impacted by this virus. Having shown floods to result in significantly increased dengue vector abundance, we hope to encourage actionable interventions to limit infection risk in light of these extreme climate events."""

Several heads of these departments have given formal training to about 110 officials from the MCG and the health department for the operations in the past two days.

We want to kick-start the operations within the next 10 days, said the officials.

According to the officials, the health department is changing its strategy this year, and will recommend hospitals to carry out malaria and dengue tests for patients displaying common vector-borne symptoms such as high fever so that early diagnosis can help in taking preventive measures at the earliest.

“The cases were much higher in 2020 as compared to 2019. We don’t want the trend to continue in 2021 and want to turn it around. So, we are starting preventive measures in advance. We aim to start taking anti-vector-borne measures on the ground within the next 10 days,” said Dr Ram Prakash Rai, district epidemiologist.

Usually, the MCG and health department start such operations during May-end, before the pre-monsoon showers. About 51 dengue cases and four malaria cases were reported in 2020, and 22 dengue cases and 15 malaria cases in 2019.

“Apart from keeping a check in the dengue cases, we also want to follow preventive measures taken last year. The lowest number of malaria cases have been reported in the past five years. The strategies for dengue and malaria are different, so we will make arrangements accordingly,” said Rai.

Meanwhile, no chikungunya cases have been reported in Gurugram since 2018.

Malaria is caused by mosquitoes that breed in dirty water, while dengue is caused by mosquitoes that breed in cleaner water. “We will identify areas where accumulation of water is common, especially during the monsoon season, and allocate our resources accordingly,” Rai added.

Following the coronavirus-imposed national lockdown in 2020, the MCG and the district health department officials, too, took conventional measures like anti-larvae and fumigation operations to curb the spread of dengue and malaria, and put kerosene in collected water pools, introduced gambusia fish that feed on mosquito larvae in water bodies on large-scale in July.

Based on the cases reported in 2020, the MCG officials are mapping areas — such as Wazirabad village — where the highest number of cases were reported and deputing more officials in such areas. “We will have a clearer idea of the areas from where cases have emerged through mapping. It is likely that localised accumulation of rainwater and drainage overflow are prevalent there, which lead to mosquito breeding. Once we identify the locations, we will depute more teams to those areas with hand-held fogging machines, and gambusia fish among others,” said a senior MCG official.

In 2020, the MCG and the health department officials had found larvae from over 1,600 houses. Following which two new hatcheries were created for breeding gambusia fish in Wazirabad and Pataudi last year. Prior to this, the city had one gambusia hatchery in the district malaria office.

Scientists have identified a new species of mosquito in Florida. I's called Aedes scapularis. Lawrence Reeves, an entomologist and research scientist with the University of Florida, identified them among mosquitoes he collected near Everglades National Park in 2019.

Collecting mosquitoes is easy, he says, using traps baited with dry ice. The traps emit carbon dioxide, mimicking the odors that attract mosquitoes to people and other mammals. Reeves then sifts through hundreds, sometimes thousands, of mosquitoes. He says, ""You look at them under a microscope and kind of, one by one, you sift through them with forceps.""

DNA analysis confirmed they were Aedes scapularis. In a follow-up study in 2020, Reeves found the species is well-established in two South Florida counties, Miami-Dade and Broward. Up to now, the mosquitoes have been found mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. In Brazil, Reeves says, they have been found to be infected with a range of diseases, ""things like Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus and a handful of others.""

It's been more than a century since there was a yellow fever outbreak in the U.S. Although they're often infected it's not clear whether Aedes scapularis mosquitoes spread the disease. But as outbreaks of Zika and dengue have shown in Florida, new mosquitoes can bring new diseases. A new study Reeves co-authored with University of Florida entomologist Lindsay Campbell suggests the mosquitoes may now spread north along Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts.

There are other things about Aedes scapularis that are worrisome. It's a mosquito that likes going indoors and it feeds on both birds and people. Campbell says, ""If you end up with a species that's capable of transmitting to [birds] and likes to also bite humans, that's the prime condition for a spillover event."" Scientists believe the COVID-19 pandemic is the result of a spillover event, involving bats or another animal species.

Climate change, international travel and global trade are all factors in the spread of invasive species. According to Reeves, 10 new species of nonnative mosquitoes have been found in Florida since 2000. And more are on the way. Reeves says, ""There's one in particular right now that a lot of people are worrying about, Aedes vittatus."" Originally from India, the mosquito ""is kind of a vector for pretty much everything we're worried about: dengue, chikungunya, Zika,"" Reeves says.

Aedes vittatus mosquitoes have now been found in Cuba — just 90 miles from Florida."

IDT said it will fill and package the COVID-19 shot, which was approved by the European Union’s drug regulator last week, for a period of three months after which it will resume making Japan-based drugmaker Takeda’s dengue vaccine candidate.

“I am grateful to our long-standing customer Takeda for its flexibility, which enables us to provide the world with much-needed COVID-19 vaccines,” said IDT Biologika Chief Executive Juergen Betzing.

J&J’s vaccine, authorised in the United States on Feb. 27, is the first single-dose coronavirus vaccine alongside two-shot vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc .

The drugmaker has been working to expand manufacturing capacity for its vaccine and previously tapped contract manufacturers such as Catalent and Emergent to scale up production and meet global supply goals.

J&J’s chief scientist Paul Stoffels told Reuters on Thursday that the drugmaker is deploying three manufacturing plants globally to produce the vaccine’s active substance and it will also have seven plants to fill and finish.

It was not clear whether IDT’s plant, which will fill and bottle vials for worldwide distribution, was part of the seven or an additional facility.

Merck & Co and France’s Sanofi agreed to help make J&J’s vaccine earlier this year.

A European Union official told Reuters earlier this month J&J had flagged possible supply issues that may affect its plans to deliver 55 million vaccine doses to the bloc in the second quarter of the year.

KOCHI: With dengue cases reported from several parts of Ernakulam, the district surveillance team has advised people to take preventive measures to curb the spread of the disease. Areas like Karanakodam, Kothamangalam, Kadavanthra and Mamangalam have recorded dengue cases.

According to the health department officials, home and office premises should be kept clean and sanitised. Around five confirmed cases have been reported in a month in division 44 in the Karanakodam area. Those with symptoms of fever, body pain and other physical difficulties are advised to consult a doctor rather than settle for self-treatment.

“Stagnant water on residential premises and in office spaces can help mosquitoes breed and cause major illnesses. The only way to tackle it is by ensuring clean premises and getting treatment at the right time. Asha workers are engaged in creating awareness among people. Health officials have also strengthened surveillance,” said an official.

On Sunday alone, according to the data with the District Medical Office, 82 fever cases were reported in the district, of which 14 are suspected dengue cases. “Normally, we remain alert for communicable diseases during the monsoon season. But such instances happen in summer depending on the hygiene of a particular area. By taking adequate steps, the spread can be curbed,” said Dr Vinu B, a general physician with a private hospital."
