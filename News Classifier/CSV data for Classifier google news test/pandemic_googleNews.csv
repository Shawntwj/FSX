GENEVA (AP) — A panel of experts commissioned by the World Health Organization has criticized China and other countries for not moving to stem the initial outbreak of the coronavirus earlier and questioned whether the U.N. health agency should have labeled it a pandemic sooner.

In a report issued to the media Monday, the panel led by former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said there were “lost opportunities” to adopt basic public health measures as early as possible.

“What is clear to the panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January,” it said.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying disputed whether China had reacted too slowly.

“As the first country to sound the global alarm against the epidemic, China made immediate and decisive decisions,” she said, pointing out that Wuhan — where the first human cases were identified — was locked down within three weeks of the outbreak starting.

“All countries, not only China, but also the U.S., the U.K., Japan or any other countries, should all try to do better,” Hua said.

An Associated Press investigation in June found WHO repeatedly lauded China in public while officials privately complained that Chinese officials stalled on sharing critical epidemic information with them, including the new virus’ genetic sequence. The story noted that WHO didn’t have any enforcement powers.

At a press briefing on Tuesday, Johnson Sirleaf said it was up to countries whether they wanted to overhaul WHO to accord it more authority to stamp out outbreaks, saying the organization was also constrained by its lack of funding.

“The bottom line is WHO has no powers to enforce anything,” she said. “All it can do is ask to be invited in.”

Last week, an international team of WHO-led scientists arrived in Wuhan to research the animal origins of the pandemic after months of political wrangling to secure China’s approval for the probe.

The panel also cited evidence of COVID-19 cases in other countries in late January, saying public health containment measures should have been put in place immediately in any country with a likely case, adding: “They were not.”

The experts also wondered why WHO did not declare a global public health emergency — its highest warning for outbreaks — sooner. The U.N. health agency convened its emergency committee on Jan. 22, but did not characterize the emerging pandemic as an international emergency until a week later.

“One more question is whether it would have helped if WHO used the word pandemic earlier than it did,” the panel said.

WHO did not describe the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic until March 11, weeks after the virus had begun causing explosive outbreaks in numerous continents, meeting WHO’s own definition for a flu pandemic.

As the coronavirus began spreading across the globe, WHO’s top experts disputed how infectious the virus was, saying it was not as contagious as flu and that people without symptoms only rarely spread the virus. Scientists have since concluded that COVID-19 transmits even quicker than the flu and that a significant proportion of spread is from people who don’t appear to be sick.

Over the past year, WHO has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the response to COVID-19. U.S. President Donald Trump slammed the U.N. health agency for “colluding” with China to cover up the extent of the initial outbreak before halting U.S. funding for WHO and pulling the country out of the organization.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

The U.N. health agency bowed to the international pressure at the annual assembly of its member states last spring by creating the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. The WHO chief appointed Johnson Sirleaf and Clark — who both have previous ties to the U.N. agency — to lead the team, whose work is funded by WHO.

Although the panel concluded that “many countries took minimal action to prevent the spread (of COVID-19) internally and internationally,” it did not name specific countries. It also declined to call out WHO for its failure to more sharply criticize countries for their missteps instead of commending countries for their response efforts.

Last month, the author of a withdrawn WHO report into Italy’s pandemic response said he warned his bosses in May that people could die and the agency could suffer “catastrophic” reputational damage if it allowed political concerns to suppress the document, according to emails obtained by the AP.

To date, the pandemic has killed more than 2 million people worldwide.

The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said its evaluation of the start of the crisis in China “suggests that there was potential for early signs to have been acted on more rapidly”.

Containment measures should have been implemented immediately in all countries where transmission was likely, the panel said in their second report, due to be presented to the WHO’s executive board on Tuesday.

Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 before seeping beyond China’s borders to wreak global havoc, costing more than two million lives and eviscerating economies.

The panel said it was clear that “public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January”.

The report also criticised the WHO for dragging its feet at the start of the crisis, pointing out that the UN health agency did not convene its emergency committee until January 22, 2020.

And the committee failed to agree to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) – its highest alert level – until a week later.

Trump accusations

“It is not clear why the committee did not meet until the third week of January, nor is it clear why it was unable to agree on the (PHEIC) declaration... when it was first convened,” the report said.

The WHO has already faced claims it was too slow to declare an international crisis, to acknowledge the virus was spreading through the air, and to recommend face masks.

Outgoing US President Donald Trump accused the organisation of botching its handling of the pandemic and of being a “puppet of China”.

The panel, led by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, began its work in July after WHO member states called for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of its response to the pandemic.

‘Hidden epidemic’

Just over a year after the first cases of Covid-19 were detected in China, experts agree that the official tally of over two million deaths and close to 100 million infections is an underestimate.

And according to the panel report, the case numbers have been undercounted from the start.

“In retrospect, it is clear that the volume of infections in the early period of the epidemic in all countries was higher than reported,” it said.

“A largely hidden epidemic contributed to the global spread.”

The WHO and national authorities were not quick enough to warn that the virus could spread between people, including those without symptoms could pass it on, the panel said.

It also questioned whether the WHO should have used the word pandemic earlier than it did.

The WHO did not use the word until March 11 last year, repeatedly insisting before that date that it did not need to use it as a PHEIC had already been declared.

The word “pandemic” does not feature in the official WHO alert system.

But the panel hinted countries may have taken the situation more seriously if the word had been used, stressing it serves “to focus attention on the gravity of a health event”.

Both sets of findings identify rising inequity as one of the pandemic’s principal outcomes. “Job destruction has disproportionately affected low-paid and low‑skilled jobs,” which “points to the risk of an uneven recovery, leading to still greater inequality in the coming years,” the ILO found. That unevenness is already apparent: Global poverty could take 14 times longer to return to pre-pandemic levels than the recovery of the world’s wealthiest, according to Oxfam.

Last year, 8.8 percent of global working hours were lost, according to the report by the ILO, a U.N. agency. It found “unprecedented disruption” among global labor markets, and that women and young people have felt the worst impact. Globally, women saw 5 percent employment loss in 2020, as opposed to 3.9 percent for men.

“In line with the focus of Oxfam’s report on inequality, ILO’s estimates confirm that the crisis has resulted in relatively larger employment and income losses for women and young people, along with the low-paid and low-skilled,” Sher Verick, head of the ILO’s employment strategies for inclusive transformation unit, told The Washington Post. “Certain sectors have been hit harder, such as accommodation and food services.”

Employment loss among people ages 15 to 24 stood at 8.7 percent. The data “highlights the all too real risk of a lost generation,” according to the report.

Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said during a news briefing that the effect of the pandemic had been greater than not only that of the financial crisis but also that of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Job losses, he said, were likely to continue through 2021 — although he noted that battered economies could begin to rebuild once vaccination efforts start to take effect.

“I am pleased to say that there is some relatively good news in all of this, that we do see tentative signs of recovery,” he said. “These signs are fragile, they are uncertain, and the prospects are notably uneven.”

The Oxfam findings also suggest a slow path to economic recovery: It could take at least a decade for the world’s poorest to recover from the health crisis, while the 1,000 richest people already have made back their losses and the wealthiest 10 have earned more than $500 billion during the pandemic.

Authors of the report said the pandemic could trigger a simultaneous rise in inequality nearly everywhere, for the first time since records began.

“The virus has exposed, fed off and increased existing inequalities of wealth, gender and race,” the report said.

British lawmaker David Lammy of the Labour Party called the Oxfam findings “truly staggering.”

“The wealth of ten of the world’s richest men has increased by more than £400bn during the pandemic — more than enough to vaccinate every person in the world,” he tweeted.

Lawmaker Claudia Webbe, also of the Labour Party, branded Oxfam’s findings “obscene” and called for a wealth tax to be placed on the ultrarich — a proposal that some experts say could be the answer to the United Kingdom’s financial recovery after the government was forced to spend billions of pounds in borrowed money to save jobs and lives during the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s more difficult to have a stable society, a healthy society, a secure society, a peaceful society, and to have a functioning democracy.”","pandemic, wealth, oxfam, inequality, report, grows, society, wealthier, worlds, richest, covid, billionaires, world",pandemic,pandemic,"LONDON — For Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk, the pandemic has been good for business.

The two billionaires, like many of the world’s richest people, have become even wealthier since the coronavirus struck, according to a report released Monday by international humanitarian group Oxfam.

Their experience contrasted sharply with those of the world’s less fortunate, who have hit on hard times and whose recovery from the pandemic could take over a decade, according to the report, titled “The Inequality Virus.”

According to Oxfam, the world’s 10 richest billionaires — which include Bezos, Microsoft’s Bill Gates and LVMH luxury group’s CEO Bernard Arnault — have collectively seen their wealth grow by $540 billion over this period. Oxfam based its analysis of the wealthiest people on the Forbes Billionaires List.

According to Oxfam, their increase in wealth would be more than enough to pay for a Covid-19 vaccine for all, which the organization estimated at $141.2 billion.

Only three of the 50 richest billionaires in the world saw their fortunes shrink, the report added.

“I remember the financial crisis and I was surprised by how fast billionaire fortunes bounced back,” said Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at Oxfam and one of the authors of the report. “Then it took four to five years. But that pales in significance to the coronavirus because they bounced back in just nine months. None of us expected that.”

The study was released on the opening day of the World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of world, civic and business leaders, which is taking place online this week, rather than in Davos, Switzerland. The conference will look at how the pandemic has reshaped society and the policies necessary for the future.

It is likely that almost every country in the world will see an increase in inequality due to the pandemic, for the first time since records began, according to the report.

It also noted how the pandemic has unequally affected people’s health outcomes. For example, in the U.S., close to 22,000 Black and Hispanic people would still be alive as of December 2020 if Covid-19 mortality rates were the same as for white people.

Covid-19 is not unique in the way it has affected different populations, said Melissa Leach, the director of the U.K.-based research organization, the Institute of Development Studies.

“Epidemics are always mirrors to society, and what this has revealed is a highly unequal world,” she said.

“We are seeing rises in wealth amongst very few, rises in poverty, and gaps between the rich and poor. And what we’ve learned over many decades is that the gaps in themselves also matter because they have knock-on effects not just for the poor but for the way democracies function and the ways economic policies unfold,” she added.

The report calls on governments to step in to remedy the growing gaps in inequality, and recommends taxes on the wealthy, increased public spending on health care, free universal access to quality health care, and permanent “social protection” for the poorest in society.

“Inequalities make it more difficult to deliver on things that any American would care about,” said Leach. “It’s more difficult to have a stable society, a healthy society, a secure society, a peaceful society, and to have a functioning democracy.”"

Nations have a “shrinking window of opportunity” to build a fair, green recovery, according to “The Inequality Virus” report, published as global leaders tune in for the World Economic Forum’s virtual “Davos Dialogue” meeting.

“We stand to witness the greatest rise in inequality since records began,” Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International, said in a statement as the charity called for higher wealth taxes and stronger protections for workers.

“Rigged economies are funnelling wealth to a rich elite who are riding out the pandemic in luxury, while those on the frontline of the pandemic — shop assistants, healthcare workers, and market vendors — are struggling to pay the bills.”

Covid-19 has unleashed an economic storm that hit the poor and vulnerable hardest, with women and marginalised workers facing the worst of job losses and the World Bank warning more than 100 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty.

It could take more than a decade to reduce the number of people living in poverty back to pre-crisis levels, Oxfam said.

Meanwhile, the collective wealth of the world’s billionaires rose $3.9 trillion between March and December 2020 to reach $11.95 trillion, the report calculated.

The 10 richest men — a list led by Bezos and Musk which also includes LVMH luxury group’s CEO Bernard Arnault, Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg — saw their net worth increase by $540 billion in the same period, Oxfam said.

That sum would be enough to prevent anyone from falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic and pay for a vaccine for everyone on earth, researchers calculated.

The pandemic marks a “pivotal” point which has exposed economic disparities and built support for “transformative” policies, Oxfam said, calling for higher taxes on wealth and corporations alongside stronger protections for workers.

A temporary tax on excess profits made by the 32 global corporations that have profited the most during the pandemic could have raised $104 billion in 2020, Oxfam said.

International cooperation would be key to implementing many changes, said Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who was among the economists polled by Oxfam for the report.

The administration of new U.S. President Joe Biden will spur “more willingness” for joint action on issues including a crackdown on tax havens and a bailout for developing nations, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

“There are some very, very big hurdles, but there are many things that can be done very quickly,” she added.

""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURELooking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted by the virus.
The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal.

He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them.

""In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time,"" he said.

""So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe.""



When asked later by moderator Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez on whether 2021 will be a re-run, a sequel or a re-make of 2020, Mr Wong said there are important differences between the situation now and last year - mainly that Singapore is better prepared to fight the virus and that there are now vaccines available.



""What we need to do really is to tide through now until the point where everyone in Singapore is vaccinated, maybe the third quarter of the year. Perhaps at the end of the year, there is a solution.""



""REBOOT"" FOR THE FUTURE

Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Mr Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a ""software update"" or a ""reboot"" of Singapore after the damage inflicted by the virus.

""We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widened the gulf between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said.

He said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups. But this year, the temporary measures will have to ""taper down"" as the economy improves.

However, he foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world.

""The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable,"" he said, adding that it will have to be done in a ""sustainable manner over the long term""."

Since being unveiled in 2016, Sophia - a humanoid robot - has gone viral. Now the company behind her has a new vision: to mass-produce robots by the end of the year.

Hanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, said four models, including Sophia, would start rolling out of factories in the first half of 2021, just as researchers predict the pandemic will open new opportunities for the robotics industry.

“The world of COVID-19 is going to need more and more automation to keep people safe,” founder and chief executive David Hanson said, standing surrounded by robot heads in his lab.

Hanson believes robotic solutions to the pandemic are not limited to healthcare, but could assist customers in industries such as retail and airlines too.

“Sophia and Hanson robots are unique by being so human-like,” he added. “That can be so useful during these times where people are terribly lonely and socially isolated.”

Hanson said he aims to sell “thousands” of robots in 2021, both large and small, without providing a specific number.

Social robotics professor Johan Hoorn, whose research has included work with Sophia, said that although the technology is still in relative infancy, the pandemic could accelerate a relationship between humans and robots.

“I can infer the pandemic will actually help us get robots earlier in the market because people start to realise that there is no other way,” said Hoorn, of Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Hanson Robotics is launching a robot this year called Grace, developed for the healthcare sector.

Products from other big players in the industry are helping fight the pandemic as well. SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper robot was deployed to detect people who weren’t wearing masks. In China, robotics company CloudMinds helped set up a robot-run field hospital during the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

The use of robots was on the rise before the pandemic. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, worldwide sales of professional-service robots had already jumped 32% to $11.2 billion between 2018 and 2019.

Some humans might be wary of putting robots in such sensitive roles. When asked whether people should fear robots, Sophia had an answer ready.

“Someone said ‘we have nothing to fear but fear itself’,” the robot mused. “What did he know?”"

The coronavirus pandemic appears to have shortened the average life expectancy in the United States, according to new research, and the impact is most dire for racial and ethnic minorities.

The deaths caused by COVID-19 have reduced overall life expectancy by 1.13 years, according to the analysis by researchers at the University of Southern California and Princeton University.

""This impact is about 10 times as large as the worrisome annual decreases several years ago that were attributed largely to drug overdoses, other external causes, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,"" the researchers write in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The reduction in life expectancy is estimated to be even greater among racial and ethnic minorities. Life expectancy is estimated to fall by 2.10 years among Blacks and 3.05 years among Latinos. The decline would be 0.68 years among whites.

That would widen the gap in life expectancy between black and white populations from 3.6 years to more than five years, ""thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006,"" researchers write.

""The huge decline in life expectancy for Latinos is especially shocking given that Latinos have lower rates than the white and Black populations of most chronic conditions that are risk factors for COVID-19,"" Noreen Goldman, a professor of demography and public affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, said in a statement.

""The generally good health of Latinos prior to the pandemic, which should have protected them from COVID-19, has laid bare the risks associated with social and economic disadvantage,"" said Goldman, who helped conduct the study.



The pandemic has killed at least 389,000 people in the U.S., and could kill more than 566,000 by May, according to the latest estimate from researchers at the University of Washington's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. COVID-19 became the leading cause of death in the U.S. in December.

""The U.S. reduction in 2020 life expectancy is projected to exceed that of most other high-income countries, indicating that the United States — which already had a life expectancy below that of all other high income developed nations prior to the pandemic — will see its life expectancy fall even farther behind its peers,"" the researchers write."

How to make sure the world is never so devastated by another pandemic?

Health officials from around the globe have been vigorously discussing that question over the past week at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization's Executive Board. The members, whose nine-day-long, mostly virtual gathering concludes on Tuesday, have heard recommendations from four separate panels.

Some of these panels are high-powered, such as an independent advisory committee set up by the WHO to look at pandemic preparedness and led by former Liberian president — and Nobel Peace Prize winner — Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Other committees are more narrowly focused, such as one composed of prominent scientists and health officials that is charged with reviewing how the current regulatory system for calling international health emergencies has worked during the coronavirus pandemic.

Two other committees were set up even before the coronavirus emerged to look more broadly at, respectively, the WHO's new-ish Health Emergencies Programme and global pandemic preparedness and monitoring. Also weighing in over the past week were two key WHO officials: Michael Ryan, who heads up its Health Emergencies Programme, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

While the conversations have been wide-ranging, common themes keep emerging. Here are six of them:

Time for fundamental change

The pandemic's toll of more than 2 million reported deaths and worldwide economic and social dislocation was not inevitable, said many speakers. It was the direct result of, as Clark put it, ""a failure to prepare adequately for a pandemic threat despite years of warnings that better preparation was necessary.""

The hopeful side of this, at least, is that it suggests there are concrete steps that can be taken to prevent a repeat if another deadly virus emerges. But over and over again, the reformers stressed that half-measures will not suffice. As Clark's committee co-chair, Sirleaf, put it, what's needed now is a ""fundamental reset"" of the world's preparedness and response systems.

The need for speed

Much of that reset will involve vastly increasing the pace at which individual nations and global organizations like the WHO assess incoming threats and take action. As Clark put it, ""The international system for alert and response has the trappings of an analog system in a digital age.""

The issue, many argued, is not so much a lack of data. Said Clark, ""Modern information systems [already] pick up signals of potential disease by sifting through hundreds of thousands of data points daily.""

Rather, the issue is that countries do not have the procedures in place to respond at the same rate. Among the ideas under discussion is finding a way to feed the signals from local clinics and laboratories into a real-time globally available tool.

Also at issue: how to speed up decision-making in response to the data, including a revamp of the WHO's system for declaring when an emerging disease constitutes a ""public health emergency of international concern."" It took the WHO four weeks after the coronavirus was identified to take that step. And even then, said Clark, ""too many countries failed to act quickly and decisively enough to apply necessary and recommended public health measures.""

One solution is to create an intermediate level of alert that the WHO could sound before a full-on emergency is declared, noted the chair of one of the other review committees, Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's infectious disease agency, the Robert Koch Institute.

But Wieler added, ""It is far from certain that [this] would result in such earlier action."" A better option might use regular global and regional risk assessments to drive ""earlier and more targeted response measures at all levels."" Countries also need to come up with clearer predetermined steps for responding to international alerts, said Wieler.

While experts are still debating precise solutions, concluded Wieler, there is strong agreement on the goal: ""It is clear that global preparedness, alert and response actions need to start much earlier and more decisively than they did during COVID-19.""

Logistics are key — as are health workers

Mobilizing the entire world to respond to a pandemic isn't just about getting countries to take action. It's about ensuring they have the physical tools to respond: everything from diagnostic tests to treatments to vaccines. In other words, there is a huge logistical component to develop and distribute. When it came to that part, ""everything broke in this COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Ryan, the WHO's head of emergencies.

""It was not just a supply issue,"" he explained. ""There were manufacturing issues. There were raw material issues. There were distribution issues. There were error issues. There were competitive issues between member states.""

So when it comes to preparing for the next big disease event, it will be crucial to address each of these breakdowns so the supply chain and logistics system are far more robust, Ryan said.

""It's a much more complicated challenge,"" he said. ""And it is going to require a comprehensive and, dare I say it, complicated solution to make it work.""

Also needed, said Ryan, is a much bigger global health emergency workforce that can be rapidly deployed in emergencies. That's because one feature of this pandemic is that countries, as well as regions within countries, were not all affected at the same time. Some were unscathed during moments when others were hard hit. ""And if they had got more assistance more quickly — if we had been able to move [health workers] more quickly into those locations — we could have saved more lives.""

Money matters

To maintain a truly robust system of disease detection and response will take money, of course. But many speakers said that just as important as getting together an adequate amount of funds is ensuring that this funding stream is reliable.

Felicity Harvey — chair of a panel charged with providing independent oversight of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme — said her committee ""has repeatedly expressed its concern regarding the lack of predictable and flexible funding of the [emergencies] program.""

Sirleaf also raised the issue, saying, ""If WHO is expected to fundraise perpetually because assessed contributions to it remain low, then this will come at the expense of its ability to focus on pandemic preparedness and response.""

Ryan, the Health Emergencies Programme head, did not dispute that. ""I'll put it to you plainly,"" he said. ""There is a massive gap in the rhetoric on funding [from donor countries] and the money we actually receive. ... My grandfather used to say, 'You get what you pay for.' ""

Inequality is a threat to everyone

The pandemic hasn't just highlighted how unequal the world is when it comes to health care. The world's response is actually now deepening those inequalities, said Liberia's Sirleaf.

Take vaccines, she said. ""Tens of millions of doses of vaccine are already available in some of the wealthiest countries. But based on current plans, vaccines will not be widely available across the African continent, for example, until 2022 or even 2023.""

""It is unacceptable,"" Sirleaf continued, ""for wealthy countries to be able to vaccinate 100% of their populations while poorer countries make do with only 20%.""

Tedros, the WHO's head, sounded a similar note. He noted that although the WHO has worked with other international organizations and governments to set up a system — called COVAX — for purchasing vaccines in bulk so that even low- and middle-income countries have access, COVAX has been undercut by rich countries. ""Some countries and companies continue to prioritize bilateral deals, going around COVAX, driving up prices and attempting to jump to the front of the queue.""

And, he and other speakers said, ultimately this would be a problem for rich countries too. The emergence of variant strains of the coronavirus that could end up being more resistant to the existing vaccines is a reminder that as long as the coronavirus is raging unchecked somewhere in the world, it is a potential threat everywhere in the world. In other words, said Tedros, ""not only does this me-first approach [to vaccines] leave the world's poorest and most vulnerable people at risk — it's also self-defeating.""

But Tedros and others argued that it's not too late to shift toward greater equity. In particular, they are advocating for wealthy nations that signed pre-purchase agreements with major pharmaceutical companies to now donate some portion of those vaccine doses to COVAX.

""I need to be blunt,"" said Tedros. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure.""

Why this pandemic could be the one that finally prompts action

Even as they made recommendations, many speakers seemed mindful of how many previous efforts to prepare the world for pandemics have failed.

""With every new pandemic or other major health threat, there are many evaluations which come up with dozens of recommendations,"" said Sirleaf. ""They are nearly too numerous to count, and too few of them have been acted on.""

Yet she expressed hope that the sheer magnitude of the crisis this time could make the difference. ""This is a unique opportunity born out of the gravity of this crisis,"" said Sirleaf, ""to reset the system."""

The rise in mental health conditions alongside Covid-19 has been billed as ""another health crisis"" in the U.S.

Just this past June, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found that 40.9% of the 5,470 respondents reported an adverse mental or behavioral health condition, such as anxiety, depression or increased substance use. July research from Kaiser Family Foundation underscored those findings, with 53% of respondents reporting that worrying about Covid-19 is harming their mental health.

While it is known that the pandemic has negatively impacted mental wellness, it is equally important to point out that America was experiencing a mental health crisis long before the pandemic. Over the past decade, mental and emotional health issues have ""increased significantly,"" according to research by the American Psychological Association.

As business leaders, we’ve all witnessed the effects of mental health challenges in the workplace, and we may have experienced our own share of these challenges as well. Many people are stressed out and burned out. And no matter how hard they try to overcome the effects of burnout — and despite the “don’t ask, don’t tell” culture that many companies have embraced in the past — they just can’t leave their worries at the door.

Even before Covid-19, mental health issues hindered employee well-being while exacting a huge toll on business profitability. Consider the following:

• A Mind Share Partners 2019 survey (registration required) of roughly 1,500 people revealed nearly 60% of respondents had experienced symptoms of a mental health condition in the past year, with 61% saying their mental health was directly linked to their workplace productivity.

• The CDC has estimated that U.S. businesses lose more than 200 million workdays each year to depression, a cost to employers up to $44 billion.

Clearly, this isn’t sustainable for employers or their staff.

Still, there are reasons to be hopeful. One is financial: An April 2018 article in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine shared that following treatment for depression, roughly 86% of employees saw improved work performance, and 80% experience higher job satisfaction. Rates of absenteeism also went down. The other is cultural: As business owners, taking care of employees’ mental health simply is the right thing to do.

The pandemic didn’t create the problem, but it certainly exacerbated it, and mental health challenges will continue to impact employees and businesses long after the virus has been managed. But as leaders, we must do more to help. While there isn’t a silver-bullet solution, as the CEO of a telehealth platform, I believe there are many ways we can provide our employees with the support they need at work and in life.

1. Set the tone. Talk about mental health openly. Share your own challenges, including your failures. Normalize therapy, and destigmatize mental illness. Create a culture where people feel safe and encouraged to seek mental health services.

2. Improve access. Make sure you’re offering the care your people need. Take a hard look at your benefits package to ensure these services aren’t impossible to access due to narrow provider networks or high out-of-pocket costs. Know that employee assistance programs are a good starting point but are extremely far from being a complete solution to employees’ mental health.

As CEO of a company providing virtual behavioral health services, I've learned firsthand from clients the major obstacles they faced to accessing in-person care. Many people must travel long distances or wait weeks or even months to see a provider. So, as you work to improve access, you can also consider giving employees access to teletherapy and telepsychiatry to remove these obstacles and ensure they can connect with a provider quickly and conveniently.

3. Take care of their families. Even your best employees will struggle at work if there are struggles at home. This is especially true for employees whose children might be facing mental health challenges that have been worsened by the pandemic. Make sure your benefits plan includes the right services for dependents.

4. Train your leaders. Lasting cultural change starts from the top down. Provide training for your leaders so they understand the importance of mental wellness, the signs of mental and emotional challenges and the solutions your company offers.

5. Create an employee resource group. Enlist help from your company’s front lines to gain greater insights into the challenges and concerns your employees are facing. Work in partnership with the group to customize solutions that improve employee wellness and foster a culture of openness and support — and be prepared to make good on those solutions.

6. Offer 'mental health' days. Make it OK for your staff to take time off for mental health by building it into your company’s sick-time policy. Show your employees it’s appropriate for them to take a breather when needed.

While Covid-19 didn’t start the mental health pandemic, it certainly has shined the spotlight on mental health issues in America. As leaders, it is now our responsibility to transform the ways we think about, talk about and address all forms of mental health challenges. Not only is this the right thing to do for employees, but it’s also best for the bottom line.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday welcomed an EU proposal to negotiate a global treaty on pandemic preparedness as a way to guarantee countries’ political commitment to fighting future disease outbreaks.

The endorsement by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came at the end of a three-day debate at the WHO’s executive board, at which the agency’s initial response to the coronavirus outbreak came under criticism. A report by an independent panel faulted China for being slow to apply public health measures, and the WHO for waiting too long to declare an emergency.

Charles Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, proposed last month that countries draw up a treaty, so that their obligations in future pandemics would be clear from the outset. Tedros held a meeting with Michel in December.

Tedros, referring to the proposal, told the board: “All of us have seen how unprecedented this pandemic is, and we have to give it our best. And I think a treaty is the best thing that we can do that can (ensure) the political commitment of member states.”

He noted that such a treaty would be the first global public health accord since a 2003 tobacco control pact. Diplomats said that the board did not examine the proposal, and it was not clear that it had any immediate traction."

While the country's attention is fixed on the rollout of the vaccine and the arrival of a new administration, the coronavirus pandemic rages on. In many parts of the U.S., case counts and deaths are still sky-high. And new variants of the virus are worrying scientists and prompting new restrictions around the globe.

Despite widespread COVID-19 fatigue, public health experts say practicing mitigation strategies is as crucial as ever to save lives. But which strategies have proven most effective?

There is still wide variation in what local and state governments are willing and able to enforce. Should masks be mandated or only encouraged? Should indoor dining be limited or halted? Different places have taken widely different approaches, and this patchwork approach has meant outbreaks keep flaring up again and again.

We know what works to slow the spread, says Dr. Ashish Jha, public health policy researcher and dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. That is, find ways to prevent people from gathering unmasked in indoor spaces for extended periods of time.

But that has been easier said than done in a country that has struggled to balance protecting public health with resuming economic activity.

""Some states have done it, other states have not, and we've seen pretty substantial differences in disease spread across states,"" Jha says.

Public health experts also note that many of the issues that have hampered states' pandemic response are playing a role in the country's complex and slow-moving vaccine distribution process.

And, they say, vaccines are only part of the solution — state and federal leaders can still take other actions to help save lives.

""If we really cared about people, we wouldn't be waiting for a vaccine,"" says Dr. Camara Jones, an epidemiologist and past president of the American Public Health Association. ""If we really cared about people, the government would do everything in its power to keep people safe right now.""

Nearly a year into the pandemic, NPR asked public health experts to reflect on what works — and what doesn't — to control outbreaks. Here's what they say is essential for getting through the current public health crisis — and for preparing for the next one.

Act, and act quickly

Experts agree that when it comes to state actions to slow infections, timing is key.

""Every minute, every day counts,"" says Sen Pei, a research scientist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

Pei coauthored a study that looked at social distancing and other contact-reduction measures across the U.S. between mid-March and early May. It found that introducing the same level of restrictions just one week earlier could have prevented more than 600,000 confirmed cases and 32,000 deaths, with a two-week difference growing those numbers even more.

A two- or three-day delay can double the number of cases during the exponential growth phase of an outbreak, Pei explains.

""It's really necessary to bring down the prevalence in the population to actually control the spreading of the coronavirus,"" he says. ""That's why, initially, you need to take decisive and kind of harsh measures.""

Choose smart, targeted restrictions

As communities reopen, Pei says, they should be quick to respond to subsequent surges by reimposing limits on businesses and activities. The longer they wait, the higher the cost, he adds.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images

Policy decisions drive numbers, says Jennifer Nuzzo, an associate professor of epidemiology and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

""A fundamental rule is if you do nothing, you will see a rise in cases followed by a rise in hospitalizations followed by a rise in deaths,"" Nuzzo says.

At this stage in the pandemic, communities don't necessarily all need sweeping stay-at-home orders or sector closures, Nuzzo says. Contact tracing can shed light on where cases are coming from and that can help states and localities respond with targeted interventions rather than by locking everything down.

""I don't think that blunt instrument is a good strategy unless you are in truly dire straits,"" Dr. Paul Carson, a professor of practice of management of infectious diseases at North Dakota State University, told NPR over email. ""We look at the various measures as sort of a thermostat that you dial up or dial down as need demands.""

For example, states can selectively cancel large indoor gatherings or reduce the number of people allowed inside restaurants and bars, Pei says. And Nuzzo encourages authorities to think not just about opening or closing places but also about how to make them safer, such as through masking and ventilation.

Ideally, Nuzzo says, states would shut things down when facing a serious surge and use that time to develop a targeted strategy for when cases rise again.

""What happens is we just open and shut, and then we kind of do this halfhearted attempt at contact tracing when we open, so of course the case numbers are going to come back,"" Nuzzo says. ""There's nothing magic about these shutdowns. These are pause buttons, but if you hit play and you don't follow it with anything, it's going to have another resurgence.""

Amp up federal support to ensure local efforts succeed

Increased federal funding is key to empowering states' pandemic response, says Jha.

""The biggest thing that has hindered almost every state from acting is the economic costs of putting in restrictions,"" he says. ""The way out of this is for Congress to provide some relief to workers and small businesses,"" he says.

He adds that for many governors, mandating certain public health best practices can be ""very politically painful.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images

Federal relief from the CARES Act made it relatively easier for states to respond aggressively in April and May, Jha explains.

After months of back-and-forth, Congress passed a second COVID-19 relief bill at the end of December, with provisions including $600 relief checks for many individuals, aid to small businesses and money for vaccine distribution.

And President Biden has unveiled a relief proposal asking for $1.9 trillion in spending. His proposals include raising the federal minimum wage as well as providing billions of dollars for child care assistance, federal nutrition programs, rental assistance and funding for state, local and tribal governments.

Dr. Jody Heymann, director of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health's WORLD Policy Analysis Center, says the U.S. lacks measures that many other United Nations countries have, such as national paid sick leave, adequate unemployment insurance and income for those who lose work during shutdowns.

""With strong and effective federal action ... states can act more rapidly and decisively without the trade-off being such a high toll,"" Heymann says.

Heymann says she is confident that people would be more likely to follow health recommendations, such as staying home when exposed to the coronavirus, if such protections existed.

Jones, the former American Public Health Association president, says support such as eviction protections and financial assistance to states and localities would all help, as well as signal that leaders are taking the pandemic seriously.

""If the government paid people to stay at home [when they're sick or exposed], if we protected the people who had to be at work, then we would have no huge forest fire of an infection in this country,"" Jones says.

Coordinate the national response on key issues

While experts say states and localities should tailor their response to the conditions on the ground, they agree that a coordinated response and certain federal measures are needed. Key among those are a federal plan for vaccine distribution and a national approach to mask-wearing.

Heymann says that while local and state mask mandates are better than nothing, she wants to see a national policy on masks, given the amount of travel across borders. Heymann, like many of the experts interviewed for this story, noted with concern that masks have become politicized but expressed optimism that things will improve under the Biden administration.

Two of Biden's first acts as president were signing executive orders mandating masks on federal property and for interstate travel. And his plans for his first 100 days in office include asking all Americans to wear masks for that time.

Nuzzo points to New York City as an example of the fact that without a nationwide approach to COVID-19 precautions, even places that had been doing relatively well can flare up when the virus rages elsewhere.

States have increasingly implemented their own travel requirements and recommendations, which are inconsistent across the country and hard to enforce. Nuzzo says this makes screening and education measures, like telling travelers where they can get tested, all the more important.

""If you could wall off New York City from the rest of the world, and you wouldn't let anybody come in with the virus — like New Zealand has been able to do because it's an island — I think that would have an important impact,"" she says. ""But I just don't think it's practically feasible in the United States.""

Be consistent in public health communication

How can states get more people to take public health precautions? The answer, or a large part of it, lies in better communication.

""One of the first tenets of a crisis is being transparent and having consistent messaging, and we failed at that over and over again,"" says Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician and Brown University associate professor.

She runs through a list of examples, including: conflicting messages that created confusion; messages that eroded trust in public health by downplaying the threat of the virus, playing up nonexistent cures or injecting partisan politics into science; and responses that failed to take into account the structural racism, economic inequality and urban-rural divisions exacerbated by the pandemic.

Even some scientists, she says, initially fell short of ""creating coherent messaging that both acknowledged the uncertainty of the moment and that enabled people to do the best they could to keep themselves and their families safe.""

Rita Burke, a professor of clinical preventive medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, says communication around COVID-19 has been especially challenging because the response comes from multiple agencies.

She stresses the need for one coherent message across the board and for being clear with the public about the science guiding the restrictions.

Replace ""personal responsibility"" with support for behavior change

Measures like in-home gathering limits and social distancing requirements only work if people actually follow them — and laws do not always lead to changed behaviors.

Dr. Patrick Remington, a professor emeritus in the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, previously worked as an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He says a career spent studying public health policy has taught him that laws are typically only effective for the people already inclined to follow a given health recommendation, like wearing seat belts in cars or not smoking indoors.

What really drives behavior, he says, is culture.

And for people whose livelihoods, paychecks and homes are on the line, he says, the cost of certain public health measures may understandably be just too high.

Nuzzo says it's not enough just to tell people they can't do something — they need to provide alternatives.

In California, for example, evidence shows a shutdown of bars prompted a rise in house parties. Like a game of whack-a-mole, Nuzzo says, authorities can't get ahead of the virus without giving people the tools to ""maintain some level of normalcy in their lives but to do so more safely.""

""So much of their strategy is relying on personal responsibility, and I think that's ultimately a flawed strategy because not all of us can comply at the same level even if we wanted to,"" Nuzzo says. ""But let's assume there are some who can, and aren't. How you talk about it, I think, is important for reaching those people.""

Ranney says leaders can learn a lesson from how many colleges handled their fall semester.

After seeing outbreaks in the early weeks of the semester, many turned to what she called the ""basics of behavior change theory"" to motivate their students to do better.

That means setting norms — in this case, reminding them their community expects a certain kind of behavior — and making it easy to do the right thing, such as by making masks readily available. It also means recognizing people's motivations and making sure their basic needs are met, for instance by providing support for testing and isolation.

She says all this requires carrots as well as sticks. And while society at large is not a campus, she believes these principles hold.

Of course people get fatigued, she says: ""You have to recognize that people are going to prioritize getting food on their table and keeping a roof over their heads over following some kind of theoretical public health measure."" But then you find ways ""to remind them when they're not doing the right thing, and kind of nudge them back,"" she says.

Make public health responses inclusive

The disproportionate harm the pandemic has inflicted on communities of color has become normalized as the months unfold, Jones says. It's vital to make sure public health responses and messaging are inclusive.

""People of color are more likely to get infected because we're more exposed and less protected, and then once infected, we're more likely to die because we're more burdened by chronic diseases ... with less access to health care,"" Jones says. ""All four of those things are deeply rooted in racism.""

The challenges that people face, and risk calculations they make, vary widely, Ranney says

""When we forget to pay attention to the fact ... that different people are going to have different needs both in terms of care delivery and in terms of trustworthy messaging, we fail,"" says Ranney.

Jones adds that the vaccine rollout and messaging should also prioritize vulnerable populations — including communities of color — who are more likely to be exposed where they live and work.

For example, she suggests broadening the category of long-term care residents to include people who are incarcerated and those who live on highly-isolated reservations or in high-prevalence communities.

And, when it comes to actually choosing to get vaccinated, Jones says it's important to recognize the reasons why people might hesitate, like scientific questions or the history of racism in medicine. The goal should be not to try to convince, she says, but to inform people about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines.

Speed the vaccine rollout with more federal coordination and funding

The same challenges that have hampered the country's pandemic response are also playing out in its sluggish vaccine rollout.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images

""It's the cheesy old leadership maxim of a failure to plan is a plan to fail, and we failed to plan and we're failing to get vaccines in arms,"" Ranney says. She notes that each state has its own plan, that none are adequately funded and that vaccine prioritization varies even between hospitals.

As a result, she notes, the public is confused about eligibility and may feel that ""vaccines are going to the rich and powerful instead of to those who are most at risk.""

The need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible is all the more pressing, Ranney says, because of the more transmissible coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the U.K. and has made its way to the U.S.

There is already urgency, she notes, with around 3,000 U.S. deaths a day and extremely high rates of new infections. But this new variant poses an even greater risk to health care systems, schools and the economy.

She says the virus will continue to mutate, and the longer it takes to get the public vaccinated, the greater the risk of another, more lethal mutation emerging.

""The only protection that we have right now are two things: One is physical distancing and mask-wearing, which we are not doing a good job of, and the other is the vaccine,"" Ranney says.

Ranney says the solution lies in more money to support efforts like hiring and setting up vaccination clinics, as well as a more flexible approach to distribution in which states aren't so worried about vaccinating everyone in the first subgroup before starting to address the second.

President Biden's plan to jump-start the vaccination campaign — including by distributing 100 million doses in his first 100 days — incorporates some of these elements. It also requires a substantial amount of federal funding.

Prepare now for the next public health emergency

A lack of investment in public health limited the country's ability to respond to the pandemic from the very beginning, experts say. It's not too late to boost our efforts in the short term and to start investing in the future so we're never caught as unprepared again.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tom Pennington/Getty Images Tom Pennington/Getty Images

""You cannot wait until there's a problem to invest in science and public health,"" says Ranney. ""What we saw during this pandemic was everybody scrambling to set up communication, to set up data systems, to set up supply chains, and these things can't be set up effectively overnight.""

On the other hand, she says, the U.S. has seen success in areas that receive longer-term funding and commitment, like scientific research.

""We have vaccines in less than a year not because of some miracle of science but because of a decade-plus of research into mRNA,"" Ranney says. ""Science and public health work, but it can't be created out of thin air.""

Countries that have developed a strong COVID-19 response all have strong digital infrastructures for monitoring and detecting the early spread of disease in order to implement preventive measures, Ranney says, in contrast to the U.S., where certain places still rely on faxes and paper tracking of test results and contact tracing.

Experts say the country needs to reinvest in public health by increasing budgets and promoting science.

Many public health departments were underfunded and understaffed even before the pandemic hit, leaving them ill-equipped to carry out operations like contact tracing, Nuzzo says. That's why having resources in place is so crucial, she says.

""We don't shut down firehouses just because there hasn't been a fire in a community for a year,"" Nuzzo says. ""And [it's] the same thing for public health.""

Ranney notes that a number of public health officials have quit during the pandemic after being the target of vitriol. State and national leaders set local and state health departments up to fail when they don't take scientific evidence seriously, she argues.

The next few months will see a ramping up of public health infrastructure if Biden's COVID-19 relief plans become a reality. Key elements of his administration's strategy include creating more large-scale vaccination sites, hiring 100,000 new community health workers and launching a major public education campaign.

But while the pandemic may be the country's most pressing public health problem, it's not the only one.

""I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that there are other coexisting epidemics in this country that are worsening during COVID-19,"" Ranney says, pointing to issues like opioid abuse and preventable chronic diseases.

A lot of the infrastructure required to meet the needs of the pandemic — systems set up to help with vaccine rollout and increased funding for public health departments — can be repurposed to deal with these other issues, Ranney points out.

Nuzzo says that once the country is no longer reacting to the pandemic, it should take stock of its experience in order to better prepare for the next inevitable public health emergency.

""This is not going to be the last situation we go through, it may not even be the worst,"" she says. ""We absolutely need to make sure we have the resources to act when and if the next thing happens, and keep them in place."""

While the global coronavirus pandemic has crippled significant segments of the economy, leading to the United States suffering the sharpest rise in its poverty rate in more than 50 years, the collective net worth of the country’s billionaires has grown by $1.1 trillion over the past ten months, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness.

Key Facts

According to the report, which was based on Forbes data, the combined fortune of America’s 660 billionaires as of January 18 had climbed to $4.1 trillion, representing an increase of 38.6% compared to their collective net worth in mid-March of 2020. On average, the wealthiest 15 billionaires’ fortunes increased 58.7%, while some, such as Elon Musk, are up more than 500%. At the start of the pandemic, there were 614 billionaires in the United States; that number has increased to 660, with 46 new billionaires being minted over the past ten months.

Key Background:

The chasm between those at the very top of America's economic ladder and those in the middle and at the bottom was immense before the damage inflicted by the pandemic on the U.S. economy. That divide has widened. According to a study released Monday by economists Bruce Meyer from the University of Chicago and James Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame, America’s poverty rate increased by 2.4 percentage points over the final six months of 2020. That’s the largest increase since the 1960s and is nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty over the last 50 years. An additional 8 million people nationwide are now considered poor, with Black Americans (5.4-percentage-point increase) representing a disproportionate share of those thrust into poverty. More than 70 million individuals (or roughly 40% of the labor force) have filed unemployment claims in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic.

Tangent:

According to an IPS and ATF press release, the gains made by America’s billionaires during the pandemic could “pay for all the relief for working families” in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, “while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before” the arrival of the coronavirus.

Crucial Quote:

“U.S. billionaires are delinking from the rest of the society, an extreme form of social distancing. Their fortunes soar while most Americans are facing unprecedented health and economic challenges,” said Chuck Collins, director of the IPS Program on Inequality, in an email to Forbes. “We are further eroding our social fabric—the sense of solidarity that binds us together.”

Big Number:

$2.4 trillion. That’s the total amount of wealth held by the 165 million Americans that make up the bottom half of the population, which is $1.7 trillion less than the wealth of the county’s 660 billionaires.

Warning Boris Johnson’s government that it risked being defined by a record of rising poverty if action was not taken, Joseph Rowntree said tackling the issue must be a central economic priority in 2021.
Sunak refused to make such a commitment when answering questions from MPs in the House of Commons earlier this week.
Helen Barnard, the foundation’s director, said: “It is a damning indictment of our society that those with the least have suffered the most before the pandemic and are now being hit hardest once again by the pandemic.
“We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind.”","paid, pandemic, universal, lowest, financially, report, hit, poverty, finds, working, support, rising, uk, workers, suffered, benefits",pandemic,pandemic,"People who were trapped in poverty before the pandemic have suffered the most financial damage during the crisis, according to a report warning the government that more support is needed to help hard-pressed families.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said those who had been struggling to make ends meet before March last year were more likely to work in precarious jobs or sectors of the economy that had been hardest hit by lockdowns.

Calling on the government to make permanent a £20 per week rise in universal credit benefit payments – which is due to be cut from the end of March – it said that many families had been pushed to the brink during the latest lockdown and had few resources left.

In its annual poverty report, the charity said struggling families would find it harder to recover from the double-dip recession triggered by the renewed restrictions and rapid growth in Covid-19 infections.

According to the research, workers on the lowest incomes experienced on average the largest cut in hours at the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, with 81% of people working in retail and accommodation recording a drop in income. More than a third of single parents working in hospitality and over a quarter of those in retail were already living in poverty before their sectors were severely hit by restrictions.

In a reflection of the uneven economic impact caused by the pandemic, the foundation said that four in 10 workers on the minimum wage faced a high risk of losing their job, compared with just 1% of workers earning more than £41,500 a year.

The warning came as unemployment in the UK is expected to rise dramatically this year after the furlough scheme comes to an end in April, and as the pandemic pushes the British economy into a double-dip recession before the vaccine can be administered widely enough to ease restrictions.

Even before the pandemic struck, causing the deepest UK recession for more than 300 years, the foundation said that millions in the UK had lived through a “decade of deprivation” with little progress made on reducing poverty, rising hardship among working households, and a steady increase in child poverty.

The charity said this rise was mainly because of the Conservative government’s austerity-era benefits freeze between 2016 and 2020, which meant that benefits had not kept up with the rising cost of living. Even after taking into account the boost for universal credit – launched as a temporary measure in March last year when Covid first hit – research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that out-of-work households got £1,600 per year less in benefits than they would have done before the Tory austerity drive began a decade ago.

Warning Boris Johnson’s government that it risked being defined by a record of rising poverty if action was not taken, Joseph Rowntree said tackling the issue must be a central economic priority in 2021.

It said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, “must do the right thing” and confirm that the £20 per week uplift in universal credit would be made permanent, saying there was strong public support for this policy choice. Sunak refused to make such a commitment when answering questions from MPs in the House of Commons earlier this week.

Helen Barnard, the foundation’s director, said: “It is a damning indictment of our society that those with the least have suffered the most before the pandemic and are now being hit hardest once again by the pandemic. The government must now make the right decisions to avoid another damaging decade.”

The Treasury said it had taken steps to support those most in need during the pandemic, including raising the living wage, spending more than £100bn on safeguarding jobs, and boosting welfare benefits. “We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind.”"

A bag of Doritos, that's all Princess wanted.

Her mom calls her Princess, but her real name is Lindsey. She's 17 and lives with her mom, Sandra, a nurse, outside of Atlanta. On May 17, 2020, a Sunday, Lindsey decided she didn't want breakfast; she wanted Doritos. So she left home and walked to Family Dollar, taking her pants off on the way, while her mom followed on the phone with police.

Lindsey has autism (NPR isn't using last names to protect her privacy). It can be hard for her to communicate and navigate social situations. She thrives on routine, and gets special help at school. Or got help, before the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and forced tens of millions of children home. Sandra says that's when their living hell started.

""It's like her brain was wired,"" she says. ""She'd just put on her jacket, and she's out the door. And I'm chasing her.""

On May 17, Sandra chased her all the way to Family Dollar. Hours later, Lindsey was in jail.

Lindsey is one of almost 3 million children in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with a serious emotional or behavioral health condition. When the pandemic forced schools and doctors' offices closed last spring, it also cut children off from the trained teachers and therapists who understand their needs.

As a result, many, like Lindsey, spiraled into emergency rooms and even police custody. Federal data show a nationwide surge of kids in mental health crisis during the pandemic — a surge that's further taxing an already overstretched safety net.

'Take her'

Even after schools closed, Lindsey would continue to wake up early, get dressed and wait for the bus. When it stopped coming, Sandra says, her daughter just started walking out of the house, wandering, a few times a week.

In those situations, Sandra did what many families in crisis tell NPR they've had to do since the pandemic began: race through the short list of places she could call for help.

First, her state's mental health crisis hotline. But they often put Sandra on hold.

""This is ridiculous,"" she says of the wait. ""It's supposed to be a crisis team. But I'm on hold for 40, 50 minutes. And by the time you get on the phone, [the crisis] is done!""

Then there's the local hospital's emergency room, but Sandra says she had taken Lindsey there for previous crises and been told there isn't much they can do.

That's why, on May 17, when Lindsey walked to Family Dollar in just a red t-shirt and underwear, to get that bag of Doritos, Sandra called the last option on her list: the police.

Sandra arrived at the store before the police and paid for the chips. According to Sandra and police records, when an officer approached, Lindsey grew agitated and hit her mom on the back, hard.

Sandra says she explained to the officer: "" 'She's autistic. You know, I'm OK. I'm a nurse. I just need to take her home and give her her medication.' ""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Audra Melton for NPR Audra Melton for NPR

Lindsey takes a mood-stabilizer, but because she left home before breakfast, she hadn't taken it that morning. The officer asked if Sandra wanted to take her to the nearest hospital.

The hospital wouldn't be able to help Lindsey, Sandra said. It hadn't before. ""They already told me, 'Ma'am, there's nothing we can do.' They just check her labs, it's fine, and they ship her back home. There's nothing [the hospital] can do,"" she recalls telling the officer.

Sandra asked if the police could drive her daughter home, so the teen could take her medication, but the officer said no, they couldn't. The only other thing they could do, the officer said, was take Lindsey to jail for hitting her mom.

""I've tried everything,"" Sandra said, exasperated. She paced the parking lot, feeling hopeless, sad and out of options. Finally, in tears, she told the officers, ""Take her.""

Lindsey does not like to be touched and fought back when authorities tried to handcuff her. Several officers wrestled her to the ground. At that point, Sandra protested and says an officer threatened to arrest her too if she didn't back away. Lindsey was taken to jail, where she spent much of the night until Sandra was able to post bail.

Clayton County Solicitor-General Charles Brooks denies that Sandra was threatened with arrest and tells NPR, while Lindsey's case is still pending, his office ""is working to ensure that the resolution in this matter involves a plan for medication compliance and not punitive action.""

Sandra isn't alone in her experience. NPR heard similar stories from multiple families — stories of calling in the police when a child was in crisis because caretakers didn't feel they had any other option.

'The whole system is really grinding to a halt'

Roughly 6% of U.S. children, ages 6 through 17, are living with serious emotional or behavioral difficulties, including children with autism, severe anxiety, depression and trauma-related mental health conditions.

Many of these children depend on schools for access to vital therapies. When schools and doctors' offices stopped providing in-person services last spring, kids were untethered from the people and supports they'd come to rely on.

""The lack of in-person services is really detrimental,"" says Dr. Susan Duffy, a pediatrician and professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. ""So school-based services are one, but also in-person services in general are disrupted [by the pandemic].""

The whole system is really grinding to a halt at a time when we have unprecedented need.

Marjorie, a mother in Florida, says her 15-year-old son has suffered during these disruptions. He has ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, a condition marked by frequent and persistent hostility. Little things — like being asked to do school work — can send him into a rage, leading to holes punched in walls, broken doors and violent threats. (Marjorie asked that we not use her last name to protect her family's privacy.)

The pandemic has shifted both school and her son's therapy sessions online. But Marjorie says virtual therapy isn't working, because her son doesn't focus well during sessions and tries to watch TV instead. Lately, she has simply been cancelling them.

""I was paying for appointments and there was no therapeutic value,"" Marjorie says.

The issues cut across socioeconomic lines — affecting families with private insurance, like Marjorie, as well as those who receive coverage through Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health insurance to lower-income people and those with disabilities.

In the first few months of the pandemic, between March and May 2020, children on Medicaid received 44% fewer outpatient mental health services — including therapy and in-home support — compared to the same time period in 2019, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's even after accounting for increased telehealth appointments.

And while the nation's ERs have seen a decline in overall visits, there was a relative increase in mental health visits for kids in 2020 compared to 2019.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that, from April to October 2020, hospitals across the U.S. saw a 24% increase in the proportion of mental health emergency visits for children ages 5 to 11, and a 31% increase for children ages 12 to 17.

""Proportionally, the number of mental health visits is far more significant than it has been in the past,"" says Duffy. ""Not only are we seeing more children, more children are being admitted [to in-patient care].""

That's because there are fewer outpatient services now available to children, she says, and because the children showing up at ERs ""are more serious.""

This crisis is not only making life harder for these kids and their families, it's stressing the entire health care system.

Tons of people showing up in emergency rooms in bad shape is a signal that the rest of your system doesn't work.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists working in hospitals around the country tell NPR that children are increasingly ""boarding"" in emergency departments for days, waiting for in-patient admission to a regular hospital or psychiatric hospital.

Before the pandemic, there was already a shortage of in-patient psychiatric beds for children, says Dr. Christopher Bellonci, a child psychiatrist at Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston. That shortage has only gotten worse as hospitals cut capacity to allow for more physical distancing within psychiatric units.

""The whole system is really grinding to a halt at a time when we have unprecedented need,"" Bellonci says.

'A signal that the rest of your system doesn't work'

Psychiatrists on the front lines share the frustrations of parents struggling to find help for their children.

Part of the problem is there have never been enough psychiatrists and therapists trained to work with children, intervening in the early stages of their illness, says Dr. Jennifer Havens, a child psychiatrist at NYU.

""Tons of people showing up in emergency rooms in bad shape is a signal that the rest of your system doesn't work,"" she says.

Havens says too often, services aren't available until children are older — and in crisis. ""Often for people who don't have access to services, we wait until they're too big to be managed.""

While the pandemic has made life harder for Marjorie and her son in Florida, she says it has always been difficult to find the support and care he needs. Last fall, he needed a psychiatric evaluation, but the nearest specialist who would accept her commercial insurance was 100 miles away, in Alabama.

""Even when you have the money or you have the insurance, it is still a travesty,"" Marjorie says. ""You cannot get help for these kids.""

Parents are frustrated, and so are psychiatrists on the front lines. Dr. C.J. Glawe leads the psychiatric crisis department at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

He says once a child is stabilized after a crisis, it can be hard to explain to parents that they may not be able to find follow-up care anywhere near their home.

""Especially when I can clearly tell you I know exactly what you need, I just can't give it to you,"" Glawe says, ""it's demoralizing.""

Even when you have the money or you have the insurance, it is still a travesty. You cannot get help for these kids.

When states and communities fail to provide children the services they need to live at home, kids can deteriorate and even wind up in jail, like Lindsey. At that point, Glawe says, the cost and level of care required will be even higher, whether that's hospitalization or long stays in residential treatment facilities.

That's exactly the scenario Sandra, Lindsey's mom, is hoping to avoid for her Princess.

""For me, as a nurse and as a provider, that will be the last thing for my daughter,"" she says. ""It's like [state and local leaders] leave it to the school and the parent to deal with, and they don't care. And that's the problem. It's sad because, if I'm not here...""

Her voice trails off a moment, tears welling.

""She didn't ask to have autism.""

To help families like Sandra's and Marjorie's, advocates say all levels of government need to invest in creating a mental health system that's accessible to anyone who needs it.

But given that many states have seen their revenues drop due to the pandemic, there's a concern services will instead get cut — at a time when the need has never been greater.

Karen Butcher's son Matthew struggled for years with an addiction to opioids. She's convinced the pandemic made it worse.

The restaurant in Scott County, Ky., where Matthew worked as a bartender closed before the pandemic, and soon other establishments, from restaurants to stores, followed suit as states imposed lockdowns.

""One day you're a bartender and you're serving people and having a great time at it, and then the next day the doors are closed,"" Butcher recalls. ""Then COVID hits. It was the perfect storm.""

Butcher says her son was increasingly isolated, just at a time when his unemployment checks were starting to come in.

""He was lonely. He was depressed. He didn't have a reason any more to get up and keep going,"" she said. ""And then, all this money flows in because of unemployment. So you're isolated, you have lots of money, and your coping skill has always been drug use.""

Matthew died of a drug overdose, alone in his apartment, last May.

Ordinarily, a spike in unemployment doesn't lead to a spike in overdose deaths. People who aren't working often don't have the money to buy drugs.

But University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan says the COVID-19 recession is unusual. Federal relief payments put more money in people's pockets last spring, just as many of the usual ways to spend it were closed off.

""Vacations or eating out or anything group oriented — going to a sports game, concerts, bars. And that kind of left the sort of things that you do by yourself,"" Mulligan said. ""Taking opioids is something that people can do by themselves.""

Mulligan, who was a White House economist in the Trump administration, argued in a recent working paper that increased isolation during the pandemic may have contributed to rising ""deaths of despair"" — that is, suicides, alcohol-related deaths and especially drug overdoses.

It's an argument the Trump administration often made against government stay-at-home orders, though Mulligan admits the pandemic itself may be isolating. His paper suggests that ""deaths of despair"" may have increased during the pandemic.

""It's not a happy time when you're not with other people. Most people are social,"" Mulligan said in an interview. ""And the pandemic has been anti-social. Whether it's voluntary quarantine or mandatory is a separate question. People have definitely been alone more.""

And a person who accidentally overdoses alone may be at greater risk of dying, since there's no one else around to call for help, or administer life-saving medicine like naloxone.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned last month that the pandemic may have contributed to a rise in deadly drug overdoses.

But Princeton economist Anne Case, who co-authored a book on deaths of despair, is wary of putting too much blame on the pandemic. She notes that overdose deaths were already climbing sharply the year before the coronavirus took hold. Case suspects a bigger problem is the nationwide spread of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.

""There's this horribly dangerous, deadly drug on the market that is responsible for this explosion of drug overdoses,"" Case said.

Fentanyl used to be rare west of the Mississippi, but it's now found throughout the country.

Chris Permoda overdosed on fentanyl in Arizona last July, just over a month after his mother drove him home from prison.

""When they found him, they found one needle out the package,"" Mary Permoda recalled. ""So that was the first time he had used since he got out. And he died — first dose.""

While the powerful opioid was the direct cause of her son's death, Mary Permoda has no doubt that the pandemic was also a factor.

""Absolutely,"" she said. ""Oh my God, absolutely.""

Permoda says her son tried desperately to find an in-person support group last year, even suggesting he might start his own meeting in a parking lot, if necessary. Zoom counseling and online support groups just weren't working for him.

""He craved being part of a group that understood what he was going through, in person. And it just couldn't happen,"" Permoda said. ""So yes, I believe it impacted it greatly.""

Both Mary Permoda and Karen Butcher have found their own comfort and support through a group called Parents of Addicted Loved Ones, or PAL. Butcher said for her, it's been a lifeline.

""Everybody needs a group of people who are walking a similar path,"" she said. ""We laugh, we cry, we pray, we learn. And we become a family who learns it's a common language.""

Permoda says this family — united by their loved ones' addiction — is growing all too quickly.

""This is an epidemic second to coronavirus, I'm here to tell you,"" she said.

Drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol-related deaths killed 165,000 Americans in 2019. Princeton's Case warns that while vaccines will eventually provide relief from the deadly coronavirus, finding a way to prevent these deaths may be even harder.

""Once COVID is in the rear-view mirror, we still have a lot of work to do to try to bring down the numbers of people who are dying annually in the U.S. from suicide, drug overdose, and from alcohol,"" Case said."

Life expectancy in the United States dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic caused its first wave of deaths, health officials are reporting.

Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“This is a huge decline,” said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. “You have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this.”

Other health experts say it shows the profound impact of COVID-19, not just on deaths directly due to infection but also from heart disease, cancer and other conditions.

“What is really quite striking in these numbers is that they only reflect the first half of the year ... I would expect that these numbers would only get worse,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, a health equity researcher and dean at the University of California, San Francisco.

This is the first time the CDC has reported on life expectancy from early, partial records; more death certificates from that period may yet come in. It’s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

Life expectancy is how long a baby born today can expect to live, on average. In the first half of last year, that was 77.8 years for Americans overall, down one year from 78.8 in 2019. For males it was 75.1 years and for females, 80.5 years.

As a group, Hispanics in the U.S. have had the most longevity and still do. Black people now lag white people by six years in life expectancy, reversing a trend that had been bringing their numbers closer since 1993.

Between 2019 and the first half of 2020, life expectancy decreased 2.7 years for Black people, to 72. It dropped 1.9 years for Hispanics, to 79.9, and 0.8 years for white people, to 78. The preliminary report did not analyze trends for Asian or Native Americans.

“Black and Hispanic communities throughout the United States have borne the brunt of this pandemic,” Bibbins-Domingo said.

They’re more likely to be in frontline, low-wage jobs and living in crowded environments where it’s easier for the virus to spread, and “there are stark, pre-existing health disparities in other conditions” that raise their risk of dying of COVID-19, she said.

More needs to be done to distribute vaccines equitably, to improve working conditions and better protect minorities from infection, and to include them in economic relief measures, she said.

Dr. Otis Brawley, a cancer specialist and public health professor at Johns Hopkins University, agreed.

“The focus really needs to be broad spread of getting every American adequate care. And health care needs to be defined as prevention as well as treatment,” he said.

Overall, the drop in life expectancy is more evidence of “our mishandling of the pandemic,” Brawley said.

“We have been devastated by the coronavirus more so than any other country. We are 4% of the world’s population, more than 20% of the world’s coronavirus deaths,” he said.

Full Coverage: Health

Not enough use of masks, early reliance on drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, “which turned out to be worthless,” and other missteps meant many Americans died needlessly, Brawley said.

“Going forward, we need to practice the very basics” such as hand-washing, physical distancing and vaccinating as soon as possible to get prevention back on track, he said.

Johnson said he would be keen to agree a global treaty on pandemics where countries agreed to share data, amid British and U.S. concern over access given to a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China.

Asked by Reuters about any action he wanted to improve transparency, Johnson said: “I think what the world needs to see is a general agreement on how we track data surrounding zoonotic pandemics... and we want a joint agreement on transparency.”

“I think one of the attractive ideas that we have seen in the last few months has been a proposal for a global treaty on pandemics, so that signatory countries make sure that they contribute all the data they have and we are able to get to the bottom of what’s happened and stop it happening again,” he said at a news conference.

“That is the sensible thing to do.”

European Council President, Charles Michel, wrote on Twitter that he welcomed “the support of @BorisJohnson to work together on a pandemic treaty in order to improve global preparedness, resilience and recovery.”

As part of Britain’s presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations, Johnson wants to lead efforts on a global approach to pandemics, including an early warning system. But a weekend statement ahead of a call of G7 leaders on Friday did not go into detail about any treaty on transparency.

The COVID-19 outbreak, which was first detected in China in late 2019, has killed 2.4 million people, tipped the global economy into its worst peacetime slump since the Great Depression and upended normal life for billions of people.

Britain’s foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday he shared U.S. concerns about the level of access given to a World Health Organization COVID-19 fact-finding mission to China, while Johnson has said he supports U.S. President Joe Biden in the need for more data from the investigation.

Asked by Reuters who he held responsible for any lack of transparency on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson said: “I think it’s fairly obvious that most of the evidence seems to point to the disease having originated in Wuhan.”

“Therefore I think we all need to see as much as we possibly can about how that might have happened, the zoonotic questions that people are asking. I think we need as much data as possible,” he said."

Abel and Richard Deitz

As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the United States, in just two months—between February and April 2020—the nation saw well over 20 million workers lose their jobs, an unprecedented 15 percent decline. Since then, substantial progress has been made, but employment still remains 5 percent below its pre-pandemic level. However, not all workers have been affected equally. This post is the first in a three-part series exploring disparities in labor market outcomes during the pandemic—and represents an extension of ongoing research into heterogeneities and inequalities in people’s experience across large segments of the economy including access to credit, health, housing, and education. Here we find that some workers were much more likely to lose their jobs than others, particularly lower-wage workers and those without a college degree, as well as women, minorities, and younger workers. However, as jobs have returned during the recovery, many of these differences have narrowed considerably, though some gaps are widening again as the labor market has weakened due to a renewed surge in the coronavirus. The next post in the series examines differences in patterns of commuting during the pandemic, and finds that workers in low-income and Black- and Hispanic-majority communities were more likely to commute for work. The final post in the series analyzes unemployment dynamics during the pandemic, and finds that Black workers experienced a lower job-finding rate and a higher separation rate into unemployment than white workers during the recovery, though this trend has reversed to some extent recently.





Low-Wage Workers Hit the Hardest

Lower-wage workers have borne much more of the brunt of job losses during the pandemic than higher-wage workers. To illustrate, we separate jobs into four categories based on each occupation’s median wage. Low-wage workers work in jobs that typically pay less than $30,000 annually, and include jobs such as food servers, cashiers, home health aides, and childcare workers. Lower-middle-wage workers work in jobs that typically pay between $30,000 and $50,000, and include jobs like administrative assistants, hairdressers, carpenters, and truck drivers. Upper-middle-wage workers work in jobs that typically pay between $50,000 and $85,000, including jobs such as teachers, police officers, accountants, and financial managers. High-wage workers are employed in jobs that typically pay over $85,000 per year, including software developers, engineers, lawyers, and business executives. For perspective, our high-wage and low-wage categories represent roughly the top and bottom 10 percent of workers, while the two middle-wage categories each cover about 40 percent of workers. As the chart below shows, between February and April 2020, employment declined by more than a third for low-wage workers, compared to a decline of 18 percent for lower-middle wage workers, and nine percent for upper-middle wage workers. By contrast, employment for high-wage workers held steady.

The economy returned a substantial number of jobs after bottoming out in April 2020, particularly for low-wage workers. This partial but strong recovery helped narrow the gap between low-wage workers and their higher-paid counterparts. However, employment for the two lower-wage groups began to decline again in October as the winter wave of the virus began, even as jobs for the two higher-wage groups grew, opening up the gap once more. All in all, employment among high-wage workers is now slightly above where it was before the pandemic hit, and employment among both middle-wage groups is just slightly below. By contrast, employment among low-wage workers remains 14 percent below pre-pandemic levels and is trending down again.

Why have lower-wage workers been hit so much harder during the pandemic? Much of it can be traced to differences in the types of jobs held among the groups. Due to a combination of government restrictions and behavioral changes people made to avoid exposure to the virus, the largest losses during the pandemic accrued to the leisure and hospitality industry—most notably, restaurants, bars, and hotels—as well as retail, both of which tend to employ large numbers of lower-paid workers. Further, lower-wage workers have much less ability to work remotely—think food servers and cashiers—compared to higher-wage workers, such as managers, accountants, and attorneys. In fact, according to new data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the pandemic began, an average of nearly 60 percent of workers in our high-wage group reported that they telecommuted during the pandemic, compared to less than 10 percent for low-wage workers, as shown in the chart below. This pattern is consistent with findings by our colleagues in a related post showing that workers in low-income areas are more likely to commute to work than workers in high-income areas, suggesting that such workers are more dependent on occupations that require in-person work.

An Uneven Experience

More broadly, employment outcomes through the pandemic have been highly uneven among different types of workers, as shown in the chart below. We group workers into categories based on educational attainment, race and ethnicity, gender, and age. While we find big differences in initial job losses across groups of workers, many of the initial gaps that opened have narrowed considerably through the recovery.

The length of each bar in the chart represents the magnitude of initial job loss, while the solid portion represents the remaining job shortfall at the end of 2020. Overall, for the nation as a whole, initial job losses totaled 15 percent and the remaining job shortfall is 5 percent. The first set of bars corresponds to workers of different wage levels, summarizing trends presented earlier. The next set of bars considers differences by educational attainment, and shows a similar pattern given the high correlation between education and wages. The least-educated workers—those without a high school diploma—saw employment fall by 24 percent, compared with 7 percent for workers with a college degree—a gap of 17 percentage points. By the end of 2020, job shortfalls totaled 6 to 7 percent for those without a college degree, compared with just two percent for those with a college degree—a smaller but still substantial gap of around 4 percentage points.

Looking across demographic groups, it is clear the pandemic caused outsized job losses for women, minorities, and younger workers as the pandemic took hold. Initial job losses among women were 4 percentage points higher than for men, and initial job losses among Black and Hispanic workers were several percentage points higher than for white workers. Furthermore, the pandemic has been quite challenging for younger workers (those under 30), with initial job losses nearly twice as large as mid-career (those aged 30 to 49) and older workers (those 50 and over).

These differences in job losses early in the pandemic reflect a combination of factors. First, some groups may be overrepresented in the two industries hit hardest by the pandemic—leisure and hospitality and retail—including younger workers and those without a college degree. Further, some jobs have been easier to hold onto than others, particularly those that can be done from home, and different groups may be overrepresented in jobs that can or cannot be performed remotely. College graduates, for example, tend to have more flexibility in their jobs and a greater ability to work remotely. And, a factor that may help explain the outsized job loss among women is that women tend to bear more of the burden of childcare responsibilities, which have increased significantly during the pandemic due, in part, to schools teaching online and many students at home. This factor may have contributed to a disproportionate share of women not working in order to care for their children. There may also be differences in the willingness to work among different groups given the dangers of COVID-19. However, it is difficult to determine the nature and magnitude of these influences.

Interestingly, consistent with recent research, most of the gaps across demographic groups have narrowed considerably during the recovery, particularly as jobs have been added in the hardest-hit sectors. The shortfall between men and women has closed completely, while the gap between Black and Hispanic workers relative to white workers has closed to one percentage point. This is consistent with research by our colleagues which finds that the job finding rate among Black workers has risen above the corresponding rate for white workers. And, the remaining jobs shortfall among younger workers has narrowed to within a couple of percentage points of mid-career and older workers. Unfortunately, as the job market began to weaken in late 2020 due to a renewed surge in the virus, there are signs that some of these gaps have begun to widen once more, as many of the most vulnerable workers are yet again being hit hardest.

Almost a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, America's nurses -- who for almost 20 years have been voted the country's most trusted professionals -- are running on empty.
But it wasn't unusual for US nurses to consider quitting even before the pandemic.
That grind could drive even more nurses to quit, worsening the nationwide nursing shortage -- and worsening the burden on the nurses who remain.
The nurses who quit still feel guiltyAll three nurses told CNN they shouldered immense guilt for quitting, even months later.","pandemic, work, nurses, covid19, care, nursing, traumatized, quit, hospital, patients, tired, quitting, job",pandemic,pandemic,"(CNN) Nursing was more than a career to Rachel Ellsworth. She says she was ""called"" to the work.

For 10 of her 12 years in nursing, Ellsworth was an indefatigable intensive care nurse. The work energized her, and she felt privileged to witness some of the most important moments of people's lives, when their worlds shifted for better or worse. Though she did all she could to save them, she also found purpose in giving her patients a ""peaceful, dignified death"" when it was time.

""I was the kind of person who went into work every day, like, literally, 'Let's go save lives,' for 12 years"" she said. ""I was just so excited to be there, so full of hope and compassion.""

When the pandemic began in spring 2020, her commitment was tested but not quashed . She and her colleagues talked about renting apartments and living apart from their families to serve their patients. Residents of their southeast Florida community threw parades for them to thank them for their work. Ellsworth felt supported, like the sacrifices she'd made were worth it.

Rachel Ellsworth's nursing job became more and more stressful and despairing throughout the pandemic.

Summer was worse. The hospital where she worked saw a major spike in Covid-19 patients. Some of those previous unknowns about the virus now had answers, many of them grim. It became disturbingly clear when a patient wouldn't survive.

""We were very limited in what we could do to help them,"" she said. ""We were losing.""

The stress came to a head in late 2020 when a Covid-19 patient she ""just adored, the sweetest guy,"" begged her to try any treatments that could save him. But they'd tried everything. She had no hope to give him. There was no dignifying his death.

After months of debating the decision, she finally quit her job in January.

""It broke me,"" she said. ""It was just too much.""

Almost a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, America's nurses -- who for almost 20 years have been voted the country's most trusted professionals -- are running on empty. They've reused PPE , canceled PTO and worked extended shifts for employers they don't always feel value their safety.

The stress and lack of support has driven many nurses to quit their jobs. And during the worst health crisis the US has seen in more than a century, the health care system can't afford to lose them.

The mental-health impact this is going to have on nurses ... I don't think we've even scratched the surface of it yet. Rachel Ellsworth.

CNN spoke to three nurses from Florida, Oklahoma and Minnesota about why they quit their hospital jobs. It wasn't a decision any of them made lightly -- they've been nurses their entire adult lives.

And all three said they're still overcome with guilt about leaving their jobs during the pandemic -- even if they knew their decision was the right one.

""The mental-health impact this is going to have on nurses ... I don't think we've even scratched the surface of it yet,"" Ellsworth said.

The pandemic has made existing problems worse, nurses say

The nurses who spoke to CNN quit for different reasons: Unsupportive workplaces, overwhelming stress, the fear of bringing Covid-19 home to their families.

But it wasn't unusual for US nurses to consider quitting even before the pandemic.

""Covid has exacerbated all the problems that we know exist in a for-profit health care system,"" said Jean Ross, president of the National Nurses United, one of the country's largest nurses unions.

Before Covid-19, Ross said, nurses were increasingly told to ""do more with less"" -- cover more hospital beds, handle more patients and work longer hours. Employers pointed to the nationwide nursing shortage. Even though there were more than 3 million nurses in the US workforce in 2019 , the field isn't growing at the same pace as the aging population that needs their care, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing

Burnout was the primary factor driving nurses to quit before the pandemic, according to a study published this month in the journal Health Policy. Of the more than 418,000 registered nurses who quit their jobs in 2017, more than 30% of them said they left because of burnout, citing stressful work environments and inadequate staffing.

Many nurses feel they can't provide the best care when they're stretched so thin, Ross said.

Megan Chao Smith struggled with an increasingly demanding workload before the pandemic.

Such was the case for Megan Chao Smith, a nurse in Minneapolis who before the pandemic worked on an end-stage heart failure floor. Nurses there helped their patients eat, breathe and use the restroom, among other basic functions. When her hospital cut staff, her workload doubled, and she said she often had to be in two rooms at once to keep her patients alive.

""If we were split in half, it still would've been too much work,"" she told CNN.

Working on that floor drained her. She couldn't sleep or exercise or be present with her wife and child when her workday ended. She loved her job, but she couldn't leave it at the hospital.

She felt she wasn't ""tough enough"" to hack the increasingly unmanageable workload expected of her.

A majority of nurses may feel the same. An American Nurses Association survey, conducted in December 2020 , found that close to 75% of nurses reported feeling exhausted in the last two weeks -- not unexpected in a profession that keeps you on your feet for half a day.

If we were split in half, it still would've been too much work. Megan Chao Smith

Another survey, from the American Nurses Association's Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation project, found that at least 69% of US nurses said they agree or strongly agree that they put their patients' health and safety before their own. That selflessness is not sustainable, said Stephanie Zerwas, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who established a free therapy program for health care workers during the pandemic.

""I think a lot of nurses got into nursing to serve,"" Zerwas told CNN. ""Their soul is really connected to being service-driven and wanting to provide for their community. But then they're being pulled in several different directions.""

Nursing during normal times was demanding enough. Then came Covid-19. Nurses and physicians had to learn on the fly about treatment and protection. Zerwas compared it to ""trying to build the airplane mid-freefall.""

It's taken a mental toll. The December survey found that just 35% of nurses said they felt like their work had meaning, and only one quarter of all respondents said they were optimistic about the future.

Many nurses have been working nonstop since the pandemic began almost one year ago. And although there's more hope now as health care workers and their older, at-risk patients get vaccinated, most nurses still feel worn down, Zerwas said.

""It's this unrelenting grind,"" she said. ""It's hard to be in the middle of that. The hallmark of pain is just that you feel like it's never going to end.""

That grind could drive even more nurses to quit, worsening the nationwide nursing shortage -- and worsening the burden on the nurses who remain.

Some nurses feel unsupported by their workplaces

In the pandemic's early days, Denise Keeley, a military veteran and nurse of 40 years, was practically begging the managers at her Oklahoma City hospital for answers about how to protect herself and how Covid would affect her work. She says the answers never came.

Denise Keeley, who's been a nurse for more than 40 years, quit her job after her requests to be kept away from Covid-19 patients were unanswered.

Keeley is 64 and has a heart condition. She had a stent installed less than a year before the pandemic began and asked her manager to keep her off of Covid units. She said she filed a ""reasonable accommodations"" request to avoid working with Covid patients that was never approved.

Conditions were dire for nurses at her hospital, she said. Keeley claims she was never tested for Covid-19 on the job -- it was only required for nurses who worked on Covid-dedicated floors. She said she was told to make her mask ""last as long as it could."" She said she wasn't allowed to wear an N95 respirator , the most effective mask in preventing Covid-19 transmission, because those were reserved for physicians.

""It was just frustrating,"" she told CNN. ""The consideration for the staff just wasn't there.""

She watched other nurses ""jump ship"" or find less demanding nursing jobs while she tried to convince herself things would improve. But she noticed that the lack of support from hospital management was taking a toll on her quality of care.

""All you want to do is take care of the patients, and then some patients would be like, 'Is everything OK?'"" she said. ""That's the worst thing a nurse wants to hear, that you think something is wrong with me, 'cause I want to take care of you.""

One night in the summer, while she sat in her car waiting for her night shift to begin, she had an inkling that her fears about her unit accepting Covid-19 patients had come true. She called a nurse on the floor, and sure enough, there were six patients who had tested positive for the virus.

She turned in her resignation that night.

Chao Smith, who moved from the heart failure floor to an observation unit, was rattled, too, when her unit at a Minneapolis hospital suddenly started accepting Covid-19 patients. Staff told nurses at Chao Smith's hospital many of the same things Keeley heard: Nurses shouldn't wear masks because it could ""scare people,"" and if they did have masks, they'd reuse them until the fell apart, she said.

""It wasn't a feeling that anybody had our back,"" she said.

Really, you cannot be forced to choose (between) your life and your job. Megan Chao Smith

Chao Smith was losing faith in the people leading her and in the institutions setting the rules while Covid-19 guidelines kept changing. She could no longer risk potentially exposing her wife and 10-year-old son to Covid-19.

She finally quit in April.

""Really, you cannot be forced to choose (between) your life and your job without people having your back,"" she said. ""I can't as an adult allow that with the kind of heart and soul I'm putting into the service that I provide.""

Keeley and Chao Smith said their workplaces didn't do enough to keep them safe. The nurses association survey from December found many other nurses feel the same -- about 27% of respondents said they disagreed with the statement that their employers valued their physical health and safety. Even more nurses -- around 31% -- disagreed with the statement that their employers cared about their mental health.

Nursing is isolating work

Zerwas dislikes the description of nurses as ""superheroes,"" even if the lifesaving work they're doing can seem like a feat of heroic resolve. Nurses, Zerwas said, are human, with foibles and feelings that can impact their work. As hard as they try, they can't turn off their humanity to get through their workday.

And like the rest of us who don't work in medicine, nurses need the support of their communities and workplaces to keep going, she said.

In the beginning of the pandemic, Zerwas said many nurses found motivation in the nationwide shows of support and gratitude for frontline workers -- the nightly rounds of applause across cities, car parades, casseroles and thank-you cards.

Those gestures have largely stopped as pandemic fatigue set in, she said.

Zerwas said she's heard from nurses who steer clear of social media, where they might've found a community of other nurses to vent to, because their friends will share photos of themselves maskless, socializing indoors or in a large group.

""It's emotional whiplash,"" she said.

Coming into close contact with the sick has forced many nurses to live apart from their families and loosen the social ties that had buoyed them before, Zerwas said. Those coffee chats, post-work drinks and other gatherings -- all gone now -- have never meant so much.

The nurses who quit still feel guilty

All three nurses told CNN they shouldered immense guilt for quitting, even months later. It's hard for them to shake the feeling that they broke a cardinal rule of their profession by putting themselves before their patients.

""Sometimes you think, 'Oh, I left them there,'"" Keeley said. ""Hopefully, someone is stepping up.""

Keeley hadn't planned to retire from nursing for another three years before she left in August. Now, she works part-time at Kohl's, providing a ""different kind of customer service."" She also volunteers at vaccination sites through the Oklahoma Medical Reserve Corps so she can continue nursing duties in some form.

She said she'd probably return to the job if they fixed some of the issues that made her leave.

""There's probably too much water under the bridge now, though,"" she said.

Rachel Ellsworth documented her time working during the pandemic on TikTok.

Chao Smith took a new job at a hospice center where patient capacity is capped and the goal, she said, is to ""love the patients and be there and not have to run out or go do something else.""

The work is still emotionally and physically draining, she said, but it's more sustainable. She's able to work every other week, so she can take over homeschooling duties when she's home.

Ellsworth feels weak and inadequate for leaving the job she loved. The nurses who stayed, she said, are her heroes.

""These nurses -- they are stronger than me,"" she said. ""They're doing it and I walked away.""

After quitting, Ellsworth moved her family to Kentucky, where she's trying her hand at homesteading (a process she's documenting on TikTok for her nearly 40,000 followers). She was inspired to move after vacationing on a friend's farm, where her mind finally stopped racing.

Though her pace of life has slowed and she feels closer to her children, she's already started to look for jobs back in intensive care and hospice so she can resume providing ""dignity in death.""

She's not certain she's recovered enough to jump back into the work, though.

""I really want to give myself the opportunity to heal,"" she said. ""That feels dramatic, but it's true.""

For now, Ellsworth will keep coping on TikTok, lip syncing to videos about the trauma she faced as a nurse. They are as heartbreaking as they are humorous. She'll go back to the work she loves only when -- and if -- she's ready."

“A real battle” had emerged in defence of human rights, according to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch.
“With the pandemic shining a spotlight on human rights, recovery provides an opportunity to generate momentum for transformation,” he said.","photograph, pandemic, used, guterres, human, health, attack, rights, covid, abuses, violence, speech, head, world",pandemic,pandemic,"The world is facing a “pandemic of human rights abuses”, the UN secretary general António Guterres has said.

Authoritarian regimes had imposed drastic curbs on rights and freedoms and had used the virus as a pretext to restrict free speech and stifle dissent.

Writing exclusively in the Guardian, Guterres said the Covid-19 pandemic had rolled back years of progress on human rights, and that abuses had “thrived because poverty, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in our societies”.

There has been a global crackdown on opposition activists and human rights defenders, increased attacks on journalists and moves to curb free speech, censor the media, roll out invasive tracking apps and put in place extreme surveillance measures, many of which are likely to far outlast the virus.

Q&A What is the Rights and Freedom series? Show A year on from the start of the world’s biggest health crisis, we now face a human rights pandemic. Covid-19 has exposed the inequalities and fragilities of health and political systems and allowed authoritarian regimes to impose drastic curbs on rights and freedoms, using the virus as a pretext for restricting free speech and stifling dissent. Rights and Freedom is a new Guardian reporting series to investigate and expose human rights abuses at this critical time, and elevate the voices of people on the frontlines, fighting back for themselves and their communities. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

A recent report by Human Rights Watch found that at least 83 countries had used Covid-19 as a justification to attack free speech.

China has been accused of particularly egregious breaches, including online censorship, invasive surveillance and the arrest of coronavirus whistleblowers.

“The Chinese regime has threatened, arrested, jailed and silenced whistleblowers and citizen journalists who tried to warn of or report on the pandemic. There are grave concerns that the surveillance technology it has rolled out as part of the effort to combat the coronavirus could be used to further stifle dissent and violate human rights,” said Benedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch.

Around the world, governments are failing to guarantee basic rights to health, education and equality, hitting the poorest, most marginalised and minorities the hardest.

Guterres said that the failure to ensure equity in vaccination efforts was “the latest moral outrage” to come out of the pandemic.

More than three-quarters of 128m vaccine jabs given so far have been administered in only 10 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Not a single dose has been administered in 130 countries, with combined populations of 2.5 billion.

While deaths tolls appear to be significantly higher in western states, the economic impact of Covid has been felt most acutely in the developing world. After years of progress on eradicating poverty, last year the pandemic pushed up to 124 million more people below the poverty line, defined as living on less than $1.90 (£1.36) a day, according to the World Bank.

The impact on education has also been “catastrophic”, with school closures affecting around 1.6 billion children, says the UN. Girls in particular are likely to drop out, leaving them vulnerable to child marriage, early pregnancy and domestic violence.

Progress on gender equality has been set back decades. “Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage,” said Guterres.

The pandemic has shone a harsh spotlight, too, on the dire working conditions of millions of low-wage workers. Massive orders for PPE have been produced by North Korean women toiling in secret factories in China, in conditions that amount to slave labour. Garment makers in Bangladesh have been left struggling to survive as orders from western clothing giants suddenly dried up. And in the Gulf, one of the world’s wealthiest regions, migrant workers have been victims of racial discrimination, arbitrary detention in appalling conditions and wage theft on a huge scale.

On top of the slew of pushbacks and attacks on human rights resulting from the pandemic, crises such as the conflict in Yemen, spiralling violence in Afghanistan, the military takeover in Myanmar and an escalating humanitarian crisis in Venezuela threaten the lives of millions across the world.

“From Syria to Myanmar, South Sudan or Yemen, or the situation facing the Uighur population in China, the pandemic has added another layer to existing and unfolding human rights crises around the world,” said Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK.

“There has been a failure of national governments and the United Nations in taking decisive action to address these big global issues and the UN security council veto must not continue to be used to block action on genocide or human rights abuses.”

In a speech to open the 46th regular session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva today, Guterres also said that racist, extremist movements are engaging in a “feeding frenzy of hate” and represent “the number one internal security threat” for some countries. He said global coordinated action was needed to defeat the grave and growing danger of racism.

“The danger of these hate-driven movements is growing by the day. Let us call them what they are: white supremacy and neo-Nazi movements are more than domestic terror threats. They are becoming a transnational threat,” he said. “These and other groups have exploited the pandemic to boost their ranks through social polarisation and political and cultural manipulation.”

The UN secretary general also said that gender inequality was the world’s biggest human rights scourge.

“The crisis has a woman’s face,” he said. “Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.”

But amid the despair, there are some reasons for hope. “A real battle” had emerged in defence of human rights, according to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. “The pandemic has posed enormous and dangerous challenges and has left millions of people less secure and more vulnerable than they were a year ago, but it has also spotlighted many of the inequalities that we can now focus on.”

Guterres called for a response based on solidarity and cooperation. “With the pandemic shining a spotlight on human rights, recovery provides an opportunity to generate momentum for transformation,” he said. “The virus threatens everyone. Human rights uplift everyone.”"

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Feb. 8, 2021 (HealthDay News) -- Wearing masks, frequent hand-washing and avoiding large crowds may not have been part of the American culture before the coronavirus pandemic began, but those habits are likely to stick around for a while, new research suggests.

A national survey from Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center of more than 2,000 Americans shows that a majority of people don't plan to return to their old ways anytime soon.

The survey found that 9 of 10 Americans will continue frequent hand-washing and sanitizer use after COVID-19, while 4 of 5 will still avoid crowds. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they planned to continue wearing masks in public.

""While the progress we're making toward recovery is exciting, it is critical that we don't ease up on the precautions that we know have worked thus far,"" said survey leader Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer at Wexner Medical Center.

""Masks and physical distancing are still our very best weapons for limiting spread, and now that we have a vaccine it will make those precautions even more effective and will drive new cases way down if we stay the course,"" he said in a university news release.

These behaviors may help ease people's anxiety about returning to public spaces and provide a sense of control, researchers said. Some societal changes forced by the pandemic may also continue, including telehealth for medical appointments and working from home.

Gonsenhauser pointed to this year's flu season as proof of the effectiveness of behaviors such as hand-washing, social distancing and mask wearing.

""Flu cases and hospitalizations are way down compared to recent years, and a lot of that is likely because precautions like masking, physical distancing and hand hygiene are absolutely working for flu,"" Gonsenhauser said. ""I think a lot of people are realizing that what we've learned from COVID-19 can be applied more generally to keep our population healthy.""

By September 21, only three-quarters of pediatric dental care providers were operating at 76% or more of their pre-pandemic volume, according to the AAPD .
Overcoming hurdles to get kids care they needBefore the pandemic, some US children received in-school oral health care or education, and many such programs have been disrupted as well.
Taking good care of teeth at homePreventative dental care appointments are key to oral health, said dentist Shenkin.","pandemic, kids, going, care, children, pediatric, shenkin, health, dentist, parents, dentists, dental",pandemic,pandemic,"(CNN) Children are missing out on preventative dental care including teeth cleaning and checkups during the pandemic, according to a new survey.

Covid-19 is a barrier to getting kids the dental care they need, said a third of parents responding to the survey released by C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health

Since the pandemic began, 40% of parents have avoided seeking care at all, citing concerns about infection, office closures and cost.

That's not good, said pediatric dentist and American Dental Association spokesperson Dr. Jonathan Shenkin. ""Delays in preventative care could result in kids developing more tooth decay,"" he said. ""The problem with tooth decay is that when it starts in childhood, it's really the strongest indicator of risk into adulthood.""

Despite fears about transmission of Covid-19 in dental offices, Shenkin said infection control measures have proved effective in protecting patients and staff.

While dentists are designated as very high risk for Covid-19 exposure by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, actual infection rates among dentists have remained low, found a November study published in The Journal of the American Dental Association.

That means parents can book pediatric dental appointments with confidence, Shenkin said. Many who do seek care, however, face delays. Of those parents who tried to book pediatric dental care since the pandemic, nearly a quarter reported longer than usual wait times, the C.S. Mott survey reported.

Some parents were unable to get their kids in to see the dentist at all. Among families with private dental insurance who sought care, 4% were unable to secure an appointment. That shoots up to 15% for families whose children rely on Medicaid coverage, who are more likely to be Black, multiracial or Latino than their counterparts with private insurance.

Here's why the delays have become so widespread, and how parents can ensure their kids' teeth stay healthy until the next checkup.

Why care became so scarce

Nationwide closure of dentists' offices last March caused a ripple effect, Shenkin said. It was chaotic, and no one knew when offices would reopen. By the time dentists were booking again in late April or May, small problems had grown larger.

""Some kids that needed fillings now needed extractions,"" he said. ""We also had to cancel appointments for kids that had prevention appointments and push them out."" That left a backlog of visits that offices are still scrambling to catch up with.

As practices reopened, they faced shortages of personal protective equipment. That shortage is ongoing, and 91% of respondents to a recent survey by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry said they did not have enough N95 respirators to change them between every patient.

Not only that, some measures to prevent transmission of Covid-19 limit the number of patients dentists can accommodate, Shenkin explained. ""A lot of pediatric practices are open clinics, and the kids are really close to each other, which of course we can't do any more. We have to have separation; we have to have barriers; we have to separate kids,"" he said.

By September 21, only three-quarters of pediatric dental care providers were operating at 76% or more of their pre-pandemic volume, according to the AAPD . An additional 17% of providers reported operations between 51% and 75% of pre-pandemic numbers.

Overcoming hurdles to get kids care they need

Before the pandemic, some US children received in-school oral health care or education, and many such programs have been disrupted as well. That's especially hard on families with children insured through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. They face additional barriers to getting care.

Less than half of dentists in the United States were accepting Medicaid or the CHIP in 2019, found the Health Policy Institute of the American Dental Association. One 2015 report by the HPI showed that just 38.5% of children living below the poverty line had visited a dentist in the previous 12 months.

That lack of treatment has real consequences for kids. Children with poor dental health are more likely to miss school and get lower grades, found a 2011 study in the American Journal of Public Health

While the pandemic is creating some shortages of care, it's still possible to get dental treatment. The government website InsureKidsNow.gov has a Dentist Locator tool to search for providers in your area who accept Medicaid or CHIP. (You can also call 1-877-KIDS-NOW, or find more information on enrolling kids in dental insurance programs here .)

The ADA offers additional support for underserved children through its Give Kids a Smile program, which includes free screenings, preventative care and treatments. While GKAS usually features big, crowded events, this year's rollout offers a mix of virtual education and Covid-safe, in-person services at dentist offices. (Call the ADA at 1-844-490-4527 for information about GKAS services in your area.)

Many community health centers, some of which are federally funded , offer free or reduced-cost dental care services. Another option is to make an appointment at a dentistry school or dental hygienist school in your area, where students do preventative care as part of their training.

If you do find a dentist to see your kids, their visit might be a little different than usual. In addition to standard practices to reduce Covid-19 transmission in medical settings, some dentists are changing their treatments. Powerful sprayers once used to remove tartar and plaque send droplets into the air , so the CDC has recommended alternatives using hand tools.

Taking good care of teeth at home

Preventative dental care appointments are key to oral health, said dentist Shenkin. They're a chance for kids to learn about taking care of their teeth. But whether you're ready to book or choose to postpone care, he added that this is a critical time to maintain best practices at home.

That starts with a diet that limits sugar, which feeds the harmful bacteria that cause tooth decay. ""The only drink (kids) should be drinking during the day is water, and maybe milk,"" Shenkin said.

It's best to avoid sugary beverages entirely, he said, but if your child does drink one, the timing matters. ""If you're going to have it, have it with a meal.""

Next up is twice-daily brushing with a fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush that fits in a kid's hand. ""If you brush once a day, you're already putting yourself in a higher risk category,"" Shenkin said.

By the time a child's teeth are touching, it's time to start flossing . At age 10, kids can usually floss unsupervised, according to the AAPD.

Such advice is familiar to many parents. But Shenkin said he understands why good nutrition and oral hygiene might slide in a hectic time, when many families are juggling disrupted school, work and home lives.

By sticking to the basics of careful hygiene, though, you'll set up your child for good oral health — whether or not you take them to the dentist just yet."

Even when the COVID-19 crisis is over, Saxena explained that 10% of these adults will have long-lasting effects from mental health issues they're currently dealing with.
There's sort of this intersection of the outcomes that we care so much about for young adults in that regard.""
Many young adults have lost quite a bit, especially when it comes to educational and professional opportunities.
Lipson also said she believes that college campuses need to offer more mental health resources and require training for faculty members so they can better understand potential mental health problems among students.","pandemic, adults, anxiety, terms, heaviest, young, think, health, students, mental, social, pandemics, burden",pandemic,pandemic,"The pandemic has closed schools, offices, sports arenas and limited social interaction for millions of people -- perhaps an even bigger struggle for young people more used to being active.

In a recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 63% of 18- to-24-year-olds reported symptoms of anxiety or depression, with 25% reporting increased substance use to deal with that stress and 25% saying they'd seriously considered suicide.

""The mental health impact of the pandemic is much larger on younger adults,"" said Dr. Shekhar Saxena of The Harvard School of Public Health and a professor for the practice of global mental health courts. ""The figures that we have from the U.S. suggest that almost two-thirds of the young adults have some symptoms of anxiety or depression or other psychological problems.""

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses develop by age 14, and 75% develop by age 24.

Even when the COVID-19 crisis is over, Saxena explained that 10% of these adults will have long-lasting effects from mental health issues they're currently dealing with.

""About one-third might actually be having a problem that is severe enough for their life to be impacted in terms of their work performance and education,"" Saxena said. ""This could actually pose a much larger burden in terms of health and disability.""

Saxena added: ""Many people are losing jobs. Some people are earning much less income than earlier. There is the uncertainty of where and what tomorrow will bring, which is faced much more by younger adults than by middle-aged or older adults, because this is the time for change in their lives.""

The Healthy Minds Network conducted a survey and found that 80% of college students reported that COVID-19 had negatively impacted their mental health.

Experts fear many of those affected are not seeking the professional help they need, and Dr. Sarah Lipson, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Law Policy and Management at the Boston University School of Public Health and co-principal investigator of the Healthy Minds Network study, told ABC News experts are trying to quantify that.

""Students of color and low-income students are significantly less likely to seek care when they're experiencing mental health problems due to cost and availability,"" Lipson said. ""Those are also the same students who are less likely to persist in higher education and graduate. There's sort of this intersection of the outcomes that we care so much about for young adults in that regard.""

The rise of anxiety and depression

Saxena explained how the pandemic is a ""perfect storm"" to give rise to uncertainty, stemming from anxiety and loss, possibly leading to depression. Many young adults have lost quite a bit, especially when it comes to educational and professional opportunities.

""For the people between the ages of 21 and 25, this is a time of expansion in their life, with new connections and new things,"" Lipson said. ""That is all being halted. I think this is a hard time for parts of life to stand still when there is normally just this fast-paced developmental time where so much is happening socially and professionally.""

""The job market that young people are entering into,"" she added, ""is very unpredictable, which I think creates a lot of a lot of stress.""

Loneliness and social isolation

Mental Health America found that between April and September of last year 70% of people reported that loneliness or isolation was the top contributing factor to mental health issues. Isolation is the actual separation from others, and loneliness is the accompanying feeling.

""One can be lonely in spite of being with others. Both loneliness and self isolation give rise to major health impacts, and the communication around the need for distancing in the pandemic has been very unfortunate,"" Saxena said.

He said social distancing really should have been called physical distancing, separate from social connectedness.

""People are forced to do that because there are rules put in place,"" he added. ""However, the attempt should be to be as connected as possible.""

Jordan Corcoran, an advocate and founder of Listen Lucy, a mental health organization, was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder at 19, and, now 33, she described the pandemic as very challenging.

""I feel like I'm working every minute of the day to keep my anxiety at bay,"" Corcoran said. ""Isolation is a major part of dealing with mental illness.""

Even after getting help and choosing to advocate for others who struggle with mental health disorders, Corcoran still faces her own battles each and every day.

""The world keeps putting all these obstacles in front of me. I don't know how much longer I can do this,"" Corcoran explained. ""I check in with my mental health every day. It's part of my survival as part of my journey.""

What can be done

Saxena said workplace stress -- employees being overworked, which may or may not be tied to company layoffs or restructuring -- is a big contributor, and employers can step in to help.

""They should be aware that people are going through stress and are potentially going into mental disorders,"" he said. ""All of that should be covered as a part of the benefit package as much as any physical problem. If you're an employer and your employee needs help in terms of counseling and psychiatric help, they should actually be encouraged, supported and financed in doing that. That is a best practice that is more needed now than ever.""

Lipson also said she believes that college campuses need to offer more mental health resources and require training for faculty members so they can better understand potential mental health problems among students.

""I think schools need to think about an expansion of a campus mental health system to include a broader array of resources, and investing in those, as opposed to just investing in more and more staff in a counseling center,"" Lipson said.

But the Covid-19 pandemic has reaffirmed it as a ""living concept"", vital and necessary to the country's collective well-being, and central to its ability to overcome grave challenges, he added.

In his annual Total Defence Day message, the Defence Minister said the concept - when put into action during the pandemic last year - saved lives and jobs.

Singapore did not have it easy when the pandemic broke out in the migrant worker community, with tens of thousands affected, he said. Many workers, especially in hard-hit sectors like travel and hospitality, lost their incomes or jobs entirely.

""Yet when the circuit breaker and other restrictions were imposed, Singaporeans rallied together and put the interest of Singapore before self,"" Dr Ng said in a video message that was broadcast on Facebook ahead of Total Defence Day on Monday.

He said: ""As we commemorate Total Defence, we ask ourselves, did Singapore pass the test against Covid-19? I say with gratitude a resounding yes.""

Introduced in 1984, Total Defence is a national defence framework consisting of six pillars - military, civil, economic, social, psychological and digital - in which every Singaporean has a part to play.

Total Defence Day is commemorated on Feb 15 every year - the day Singapore fell to Japanese troops in 1942.

Digital defence was added as the sixth pillar in 2019, and MP for Marine Parade GRC Seah Kian Peng as recently as this month called for climate defence to be added as the seventh pillar to underscore the importance of tackling the issue.

In his message, Dr Ng described at length how Singapore came together to tackle the pandemic, from healthcare workers to economic agencies that kept supply chains intact and pre-ordered vaccines, and security forces that did not let their guard down and ensured that law and order was maintained.

While infections soared in countries around the world, the spread within the community in Singapore was contained, he said, and hospitals were not overwhelmed. ""Most importantly, deaths were kept down.""

Businesses also complied with restrictions imposed, and companies quickly adopted plans for staff to work from home. Community groups spun into action spontaneously, whether to sew masks or help the vulnerable and encourage compliance, he noted.

Retired doctors and nurses came back to help, and full-time national servicemen extended their service to fight against the pandemic, he added.

""That cohesion and compliance allowed us to celebrate national events like the National Day and New Year without further outbreaks.

""It also ensured that we could open our borders early to resume global trade and commerce which are essential to Singapore's economy."""

When COVID-19 began spreading across the United States early last year, millions of people fled communities where they feared getting infected or headed home from closed-down college campuses. As lockdowns and economic pain dragged on, pandemic migrants surveyed last fall were more likely than those interviewed in the spring to have relocated due to financial stress and less likely to cite risks of getting the coronavirus, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

The survey also found that where people moved changed over the course of the pandemic. In November, a smaller share of those who moved because of the coronavirus outbreak said they had moved in with a family member than was the case in a June survey.

Following the coronavirus outbreak, a sizable share of Americans relocated for a variety of pandemic-related reasons. This research sought to trace how the dynamics behind decisions to move changed over time. To do so, 12,648 U.S. adults were surveyed from Nov. 18-29, 2020, and the results were compared with those from a survey conducted June 4-10, 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. This survey includes a total sample size of 372 Asian Americans. The sample includes English-speaking Asian Americans only and, therefore, may not be representative of the overall Asian American population (72% of our weighted Asian American sample was born in another country, compared with 77% of the Asian American adult population overall). Despite this limitation, it is important to report the views of Asian Americans on the topics in this study. As always, Asian Americans’ responses are incorporated into the general population figures throughout this report. Because of the relatively small sample size and a reduction in precision due to weighting, we are not able to analyze Asian American respondents by demographic categories, such as gender, age or education. For more, see “Polling methods are changing, but reporting the views of Asian Americans remains a challenge.” “Middle income” is defined here as two-thirds to double the median annual family income for panelists on the American Trends Panel after adjusting for differences in purchasing power by geographic region and for household size. “Lower income” falls below that range; “upper income” falls above it. In this sample, 32% are lower income, 45% are middle income and 19% fall into the upper-income tier. An additional 4% either didn’t offer a response to the income question or the household size question. For more information about how the income tiers were determined, please visit this link. Here are the questions used for the November survey, along with responses, and its methodology.

One-in-twenty U.S. adults (5%) said they personally moved out of where they were living either permanently or temporarily due to the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the new survey conducted Nov. 18-29, 2020. That is somewhat higher than the 3% who said so in a survey in June. In the November survey, a total 10% of adults said they either moved or had someone else move in with them due to the coronavirus outbreak, up slightly from 8% in June.

Young adults ages 18 to 29 were more likely than any other age group in both surveys to have moved due to the outbreak – 11% said they did in the November survey. Adults in lower-income households (9%) were more likely to say they moved due to the virus than those with middle (3%) or upper incomes (4%). Hispanic (9%) and Black (7%) adults were more likely than those who are White (4%) to say this.

Financial reasons cited more often than in June

In November, a third of U.S. adults who moved due to the pandemic cited financial problems as the most important reason they relocated (17% said job loss and 15% said financial problems other than job loss). That compares with 18% who cited job loss or other financial reasons in June.

Other reasons cited in November included wanting to be near family or a partner (17%, vs. 20% who said they wanted to be near family in June) and the higher risk of coronavirus where they had been living (14% vs. 28% in June). Additional causes were their college campus closing or courses going online (14% in November vs. 23% who said in June they moved because their campus closed) and too many restrictions due to COVID-19 where they lived (12%, a category not asked about in the June survey). Other people who moved due to the virus said the main reason was that they needed more space (2%) or were able to work remotely (1%).

According to U.S. adults who had someone move in with them due to the coronavirus outbreak, financial problems were a notable reason given by the person who moved. About a third (36%) of those who had someone move in with them due to the outbreak said that money troubles (including job loss) were the main reason their new housemate left where they had been living. Other reasons included being near family or a partner (18%), the risk of COVID-19 where they were living (14%), a college campus closing or going online (13%) and too many restrictions due to the outbreak (9%).

Smaller share in later survey said they moved in with family

Among those who moved due to the coronavirus outbreak, 42% said they relocated to the home of a family member, down from 61% who said so in June. Three-in-ten of those who moved due to the outbreak went to their parents’ or in-laws’ home, according to the November survey. The rest went to the home of a child, child’s spouse or another unspecified family member.

One factor behind the shift in where Americans moved due to the coronavirus could be that more of them bought or rented their own homes, rather than moving in with others. In November, 30% of pandemic movers said they either rented a new home on “a short-term basis” (14%) or bought or rented one “on a long-term basis” (16%). In June, 16% said they rented a new home “for this period” or bought or rented a new home “to continue living in after this period.” (A difference in question wording between the June and November surveys prevents an exact comparison.)

About one-in-ten of those who moved due to the pandemic relocated to a vacation home (10%) or friend’s home (8%), according to the November survey.

Among the 6% of adults who said someone else moved in with them due to the coronavirus outbreak, family remained the most common group to do so. About half (51%) said an adult child or child’s spouse moved in with them, and about a quarter (23%) said a parent or parent-in-law did. The rest included a friend (29%), romantic partner (24%) or someone else (35%). (Some people had more than one person move in with them.)

The large share who had adult children move into their households reflects a broader societal trend. A Pew Research Center analysis found that a majority of young adults were living with their parents in July, the highest share since the Great Depression. Among those who had an adult child move in (and no one else), 27% said in November it was because their college closed or went online.

Some people have moved back

Most coronavirus migrants have not returned to where they had been living before the pandemic, according to the new survey. Of those who moved due to COVID-19, 69% said they reside in a different home than where they lived before. This includes 40% who are in a different community and 29% who are living in the same community where they lived before but in a different home.

About three-in-ten (31%) of those who moved due to the coronavirus outbreak said they are back in the same home where they had been living before the pandemic.

Likewise, a majority (58%) of those who had people move in with them due to the pandemic said at least one of them is still there. About four-in-ten (39%) said that they now have no one living with them who had moved in due to the coronavirus.

People who relocated for pandemic-related reasons are less likely than other movers to see their move as positive

The survey also included people who moved between February and November 2020 for reasons other than the coronavirus outbreak. Not surprisingly, coronavirus migrants are less likely than other Americans who relocated to have said their change of residence had a positive impact on their lives.

Only about four-in-ten (43%) of those who moved due to the coronavirus outbreak said it had a positive impact, compared with about six-in-ten adults (61%) who said they moved since last February for reasons unrelated to the pandemic. The share of pandemic-induced movers who said that relocation had a negative impact (29%) was higher than the share of other movers (12%) who said so.

Counting the dead is one of the first, somber steps in reckoning with an event of enormous tragic scope, be that war, natural disaster or a pandemic.

This dark but necessary arithmetic has become all too routine during the COVID-19 outbreak.

January was the deadliest month so far in the U.S.; the virus killed more than 95,458 Americans.

The total U.S death toll has now surpassed 441,000.

Each death is unique, a devastating loss that ripples through a family, a network, a community. But in the aggregate, the national death toll can feel abstract, and its constant repetition in the news can become numbing. Journalists, commentators and public officials are left searching for new ways to convey the deadliness of this pathogen, and the significance of its mounting fatality rate.

Many have turned to history, citing Pearl Harbor (2,403 killed) or the 9/11 attacks (at least 2,977 killed), as a way of providing perspective when the number of daily COVID deaths in the U.S. reached those levels. (Currently, more than 3,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day.)

Jan. 21, 2021 offered another opportunity for historical comparison: That was the day when the COVID death toll in the U.S. reached — and then exceeded — the 405,399 Americans who died in World War II.

For many, attempting to compare the two death tolls — or even take note of their brief conjunction — is misguided or even offensive. It is certainly a morally fraught exercise. The true emotional and social impact of either event can never be quantified, but many media outlets still mentioned it.

Which raises the question: Are we as a society too quick to reach for these historical comparisons? Should a politically driven world war and a biologically driven pandemic, more than seven decades apart, be put side by side at all?

""This is comparing apples to oranges,"" wrote NPR listener Kris Petron in December, in response to a story that made use of that comparison. ""It is extremely disrespectful to our nation's veterans, who write a blank check with their lives, to defend our Constitution.""

Petron is not alone.

This type of response, over time, has convinced medical historian Dr. Howard Markel to make it a practice of never drawing parallels between the death toll from war and a pandemic.

""I try not to make comparisons to an event or group that I know contains within it a great deal of sentiment, feeling and pain,"" says Markel, a professor at the University of Michigan and author of When Germs Travel: Six Major Epidemics That Have Invaded America and the Fears They Have Unleashed.

The notion that combat deaths carry a unique meaning or value is deeply rooted in human culture. Societies tend to valorize those who died for a cause on a battlefield.

But in this pandemic it's the frail elderly — many of them living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities — who have died in vast numbers.

""To the watching world, that's not the same as the death of a young soldier in their 20s, let's say, on the front lines in a war,"" says Yale historian Frank Snowden, author of Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.

""But, I don't think we have a right to weigh up lives and say which is more important,"" Snowden added.

Unlike COVID-19, the global influenza pandemic of 1918-19 killed many people who were in their 20s and 30s — yet as Snowden notes, there wasn't much collective mourning for those young adults, despite dying in the prime of life.

""People were so used to mortality because of the [first world] war that even the horrible tallies that were coming with the Spanish influenza had lost their capacity to horrify the way that one might expect,"" he says.

When we do compare death tolls, what exactly are we comparing?

The effort to compare the death toll of the pandemic with that of a war strikes historian Sam Biagetti as an especially ""modern"" exercise.

""Through the vast majority of human history, people have understood warfare and disease to go hand in hand and to be inextricably linked,"" says Biagetti, who is the creator and host of the podcast Historiansplaining.

The flu pandemic 100 years ago was fueled by the conditions of World War I and ultimately killed more people than the war, with an estimated 50 million flu deaths worldwide and upwards of 700,000 flu deaths in the U.S.

""All those millions of deaths were another outcome of the war, and people didn't understand them necessarily as two separate phenomena,"" he says.

In fact, before World War II, combatants were far more likely to die of an infectious disease than from battle-related trauma. Biagetti points out that World War II was the first conflict in American history in which combat killed more fighters than disease, a pattern which has continued since and reflects medical advances such as vaccines and antibiotics.

""We've really changed how we think about war, in a way that is misleading and distorting — this idea you can kind of sum up the toll of a war just by counting the bodies from the battlefield,"" Biagetti says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Hulton Archive/Getty Images Hulton Archive/Getty Images

Official military records are one way of assessing a conflict's lethality, but they have limits, which is why Biagetti views them as inadequate for understanding the full breadth of the impact of these historical events.

The carnage of war doesn't end just because peace is declared. The chaos and turmoil often fuels further death, as the influenza pandemic did in World War I. The spillover effects of war continue long after formal hostilities end, and include disability and disfigurement, mental trauma, addiction, homelessness and suicide.

One example is the ongoing suicide crisis among U.S. veterans. Between 2005 and 2017, 78,875 veterans died by suicide — more than the number of soldiers killed in Vietnam, 58,220.

For all these reasons, Biagetti worries about comparing the current pandemic to any war, even if just for the purpose of counting the dead.

""You can't just try to sum up in a simple statistic, how big is this disaster versus that disaster, as if they can even be summed up in a simple number at all.""

And yet the language of warfare permeates so much of the national discourse about the pandemic.

Nurses work on the ""frontlines."" Coronavirus is described as an invisible ""enemy."" The country is ""battling"" the virus.

As a metaphor, ""war"" becomes a call to action, and a recognition of sacrifice

On Jan. 15, then-President-elect Joe Biden announced his vaccine distribution plan, declaring: ""We're in a war with this virus.""

Five days later, in his inaugural address, he said: ""It's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.""

Some Americans whose relatives have died from COVID embrace the rhetoric of war, and believe comparing the pandemic to past wars is imperative.

""The scale of this is that of a war, it's just a different type of war and it's not one that we're necessarily taught in our history books,"" says Kristen Urquiza, who co-founded the advocacy group Marked By COVID after her father died from the disease over the summer.

Urquiza believes that the country struggled collectively to respond to the coronavirus because Americans have little understanding about what it takes to overcome a pandemic.

""In a way, it's sort of more dangerous [than war] because we are culturally unprepared for it.""

There are also veterans who feel the war analogies are appropriate, and even helpful. Dr. Cleavon Gilman, an emergency physician in Yuma, Ariz., has treated COVID-19 patients from the early days of the outbreak and readily compares the pandemic to a war.

""It's very hard to communicate the severity of this pandemic if you're not in a hospital, where this war is being waged,"" says Gilman, who served as a Marine combat medic in Iraq in 2004.

World War II was the deadliest war in human history, but not in American history: that distinction belongs to the Civil War. The death toll has traditionally been estimated to be about 618,000 but new research indicates 750,000 may be more accurate.

But World War II looms large in America's cultural memory as a ""good war,"" one that united the country against a clear-cut enemy, says Catherine Mas, a history professor at Florida International University who studies the history of medicine, race and religion.

In retrospect, the American response to World War II stands in sharp contrast to the current political divisions over the coronavirus, and the fragmented and uneven national response.

Despite the differences, Mas says the comparisons can still be powerful tools as the country tries to reckon with a crisis that has taken place out of sight for many Americans. People are dying in hospitals, without family members at the bedside, and only healthcare workers are there to bear witness.

""The reason we want to compare COVID-19 deaths to something like World War II is not just because the numbers are there, but to acknowledge this is a significant rupture in society,"" she says.

""This mass death is going to create trauma: how are we going to deal with that? How have we dealt with that in the past? I think it's part of our human condition to try to search for some reference points.""

Most Americans say they will continue preventive measures after COVID-19 pandemic ends

Most adults in the United States intend to continue to adhere to preventive measures — such as hand washing, masking and physical distancing — even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends, according to results of a national survey.

“More than anything else, the responses to this survey reflect just how seriously the pandemic has upended so many people's lives,” Iahn Gonsenhauser, MD, chief quality and patient safety officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told Healio Primary Care.

Reference: The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Survey: Most Americans say they’ll continue health precautions after COVID-19.

Gonsenhauser and colleagues surveyed more than 2,000 adults. Results showed that after the pandemic ends:

72% plan to continue to wear masks in public;

80% intend to still avoid crowds; and

90% plan to frequently wash their hands and use sanitizer.

Gonsenhauser said he was “surprised and not surprised” by the findings.

“On the one hand, I understand the sort of trauma that we have all been through with the pandemic and how that's going to influence our forward thinking,” he said. “At the same time, I am surprised that so many people are saying that they're going to continue to do these things even after the pandemic is over. That paints a little bit of a more optimistic picture than we're likely to really observe.”

Iahn Gonsenhauser



Gonshenhauser also noted the sizeable impact that preventive measures may be having on seasonal influenza.

“When we look at what happened with the flu in the U.S., we are having one of the best flu seasons we have ever seen,” Gonsenhauser said.

According to the CDC, influenza activity is “unusually low.” Most recent data show that of the 554,588 specimens tested by clinical laboratories since September 2020, only 1,316 (0.2%) have been positive for influenza.

“If we can find a way to get that story to resonate with people who would rather not get as many colds or not to get knocked out of work for a few days with the flu, the low flu rates can help people realize that these precautions are not just about COVID-19, but a wide variety of viral infections.”

FRIDAY, Feb. 19, 2021 (HealthDay News) -- The stress of the pandemic could be prompting some people to turn to he bottle more often, researchers warn.

This is particularly problematic for people who live in areas where there are stay-at-home orders, especially for young adults, men and people who have lost their jobs.

""Being under lockdown during a worldwide pandemic has been hard on everyone, and many people are relying on greater quantities of alcohol to ease their distress,"" said William ""Scott"" Killgore, a professor of psychiatry in the University of Arizona's College of Medicine and director of the university's Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab.

""We found that younger people were the most susceptible to increased alcohol use during the pandemic, which could set them on the dangerous path toward long-term alcohol dependence,"" he said in a university news release.

Killgore's team led a six-month study from April through September, in which nearly 6,000 adults from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., were surveyed. Each month, about 1,000 people completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, a 10-item questionnaire that detects hazardous drinking in adults.

The questions asked about the quantity of alcohol consumed, behaviors associated with dependence, and harm resulting from alcohol use. Scores range from 0 to 40. A score from 8 to 14 suggests hazardous alcohol consumption, 15 or more indicates likelihood of alcohol dependence and 20 or more suggests a severe alcohol use disorder.

For people not under lockdown restrictions, percentages stayed the same.

But for those under lockdown, hazardous alcohol use rose from 21% in April to 40.7% in September, and probable dependence rose from nearly 8% to just over 29%. Severe dependence rose from nearly 4% in April to 17.4% by September. Hazardous alcohol use and likely dependence increased every month for those under lockdowns compared to those under no restrictions.

Increased alcohol use can lead to numerous health problems, including increased risks of cancer, liver disease, injury, mental health problems and early death. It can be a problem for the entire family, the researchers said."

These shifts mean fewer jobs at hotels, restaurants and downtown shops, in addition to ongoing automation of office support roles and some factory jobs.

“We’re recovering, but to a different economy,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said in November.

The nation’s unemployed are starting to react to these big shifts. Two-thirds of the jobless say they have seriously considered changing their occupation or field of work, according to the Pew Research Center. That is a significant increase from the Great Recession era, when 52 percent said they were considering such a change.

“We think that there is a very real scenario in which a lot of the large employment, low-wage jobs in retail and in food service just go away in the coming years,” said Susan Lund, head of the McKinsey Global Institute. “It means that we’re going to need a lot more short-term training and credentialing programs.”

One problem for many unemployed people is they lack the money to retrain. This crisis has put many out of work for nearly a year, and the financial support from unemployment and food stamps is often not sufficient to pay their bills. The stimulus legislation being debated in Congress does not include any money for retraining.

“Trying to figure out what to do six months from now is hard when you are trying to make ends meet and you don’t have enough food,” said Brad Hershbein, who helps design and study retraining programs as a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.

Take Serena Couch, who lost her job at Disney World in Orlando in April. She initially held out hope that she would be called back, but as the months went by, it became clear that that was unlikely. Now the 27-year-old has started spending her days looking for jobs and trying to learn to code by watching YouTube videos and reading blogs.

“I’m trying to learn coding on my own, because that’s what everyone says to do when you’re in this position,” said Couch, who receives about $500 a month in jobless benefits, not enough to pay bills. “I can’t afford to pay for a program, so I’m just doing free programs online.”

Couch and her boyfriend, who is also laid off from a theme park, moved in with a relative to save money, and her car was repossessed around Christmas. Couch said she never intended to make a career in the hospitality industry, but without a college degree, she thought her job options were limited.

“We haven’t been able to find anything that makes nearly as much as that Disney job,” Couch said.

Indeed, the number of workers in need of retraining could be in the millions, according to McKinsey and David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-wrote a report warning that automation is accelerating in the pandemic. He predicts far fewer jobs in retail, rest, car dealerships and meatpacking facilities.

“Once robots are in place, we won’t go back. Once you’ve made that type of capital investment, you don’t tend to go backward,” Autor said. In the report he wrote, “These developments were sure to happen over the longer run. But the crisis has pulled them forward in time.”

Automation of jobs often speeds up during recessions, as companies look to cut costs and use periods of layoffs to experiment with new technologies. Some economists predict that there could be more automation now, because the pandemic forced companies to look for ways to minimize the number of employees in a workspace and the vast scale of the layoffs in the economy gives executives a unique opportunity to bring in robots.

Chewy, an online pet food and supply company, opened its first fully automated fulfillment center in Archbald, Pa., in October. Wall Street analysts who monitor the company closely say the facility — a warehouse where orders are processed and packaged for delivery — needs only about a third of the workers who are at Chewy’s other warehouses.

“When you can take labor out and replace it with automation, you are taking out a significant cost,” said Stephanie Wissink, a managing director at Jefferies who researches Chewy. “You won’t eliminate all labor. Chewy will still have engineers and warehouse directors, but there won’t be nearly as many individual laborers walking those floors.”

Chewy chief executive Sumit Singh told investors that the Archbald facility is already more productive than any of the nine other warehouses, and that there are plans to build more.

Chewy spokeswoman Diane Pelkey referred The Post to an article saying the Archbald facility would create 1,000 jobs. She declined to comment on whether those jobs came to fruition or how staffing compares to Chewy’s other facilities.

Job postings in recent months help illustrate what positions are emerging and which are rapidly going away, said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. Chamberlain has seen a rapid decline in posts seeking administration assistants, human resources personnel, food service workers, beauty consultants, pet groomers, valets, professors, brand ambassadors and even physical therapists and audiologists. Only some of these jobs will come back. He’s hesitant to give an exact number, but he agrees that millions may need to find a new career.

“During a crisis, everything is on the table. You can easily push for big changes in a company,” Chamberlain said. “When you rebuild, you have a chance to rethink your workforce.”

Although many of the nation’s 20 million people receiving unemployment want to change jobs and increase their skills, it’s often difficult to predict which sectors of the economy will experience sustainable growth.

As online retail has boomed during the pandemic, warehouses have added nearly 115,000 jobs in the past year, meaning more workers are in the field now than there were pre-pandemic. Yet even that field is not a sure bet. Automation has become cheap enough that it is now being deployed more readily in warehouses and on factory floors, as Chewy illustrates.

Hershbein, the economist who studies retraining programs, said there has been a massive shift from just trying to help people write résumés and look at job listings to setting up partnerships with local businesses, offering career coaching about growing industries in the region, and helping job seekers arrange transportation and child care. The more holistic approach pays off, but it is often more costly and time-intensive.

An early sign of the high demand right now for more upskilling and retraining is on display in Michigan. The state used some of its stimulus money last year to create a “Futures for Frontliners” program to give free tuition to grocery store clerks, health aides and other front-line workers so they can earn a certificate or an associate degree. More than 100,000 people applied. The program also comes with career advice.

Meanwhile, the $1.9 trillion relief bill stimulus package that President Biden proposed and House Democrats have been working on does not include any funding specifically for retraining. A person familiar with the deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said lawmakers hope to include retraining spending in legislation later this year.

Economists say that over time, the United States probably will employ the same overall number of people that the nation had pre-pandemic, but the specific jobs people do are likely to change. For the people who need to shift careers, it is a major life change.

“I’ve seen businesses who have told me they have been thinking about doing automation investments, but have decided this is the time to do it,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told The Post. “We’ve seen real changes in the willingness of businesses to leverage technology to deliver their services.”

Bostic described a hospital in the Atlanta area that went from 3 percent of visits done via telehealth before the pandemic to 33 percent now, a shift that probably means the hospital cafe and parking area won’t need as many employees.

For many, the career shift is driven by necessity.

Marco Leaver is a waiter at a top Miami hotel. He worked New Year’s Eve during the pandemic and served only two tables, a major letdown from the prior year when he made $800 in that single night.

Leaver, 21, doesn’t know whether business travel will ever be like it was before. He has read about the estimates from Bill Gates and others, but his biggest indicator is the near-empty restaurant around him — the same situation at most of the city’s hotels. He went from making $75,000 a year to about $20,000 as his hours were cut and tips dried up.

He wants options. In November, he got his real estate license, a path to a new career.

“I have a few clients now, so I might be able to transition into that,” Leaver said. “I never thought things could’ve possibly gotten this bad when the pandemic began.”"

The U.K. strain has already been reported in more than half of the states, but as in the U.K., the numbers could increase rapidly.","turning, pandemic, bergstrom, recent, corner, strain, variant, country, uk, spring, vaccines, variants",pandemic,pandemic,"Halfway through a bleak winter, Dr. Diane Griffin started to feel something in recent weeks that had been missing for much of the past year: optimism.

Griffin, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said recent declines in hospitalizations, daily deaths and confirmed new infections were fueling hope that the U.S. has arrived at a turning point in the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic.

""What we're seeing is incremental and encouraging,"" Griffin said, ""but we're not out of the woods yet.""

More than a year into the pandemic, developments that seem at odds with one another have made it difficult to determine just where the U.S. and the world stand.

Griffin's optimism is tempered by the fact that while case numbers have been decreasing steadily, they are still much higher than they were during the first wave, which overwhelmed parts of the country last spring and summer. And looming over all the recent progress is the threat of more contagious coronavirus variants that are already spreading rapidly in the U.S. — along with concerns that variants could pose problems for the current round of vaccines.

Scientists say that while it's heartening to see declines after some of the deadliest and most challenging months of the pandemic, it may be too soon to know whether the U.S. is experiencing a temporary reprieve or whether it is finally starting to get control of the pandemic.

And while some optimism is warranted, the psychological challenges of the pandemic — in which human behavior and collective responsibility remain crucial to keep outbreaks under control — mean communities must remain vigilant.

""We are seeing a dip right now, but I don't think that changes the thought that we have to be very careful in the weeks ahead,"" said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. ""Whether this is a momentary dip or whether we reached the peak and now things are coming down — that's not completely clear.""

Further clouding the forecasts are questions about how the known coronavirus variants, including a more transmissible strain that is thought to have emerged in the U.K., might alter the pandemic's course.

Some research suggests there's already cause for concern.

A recent study that was published to the preprint server medRxiv but hasn't yet been peer-reviewed found that cases of the U.K. variant are doubling in the U.S. every 10 days. The findings seem to confirm a report the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released last month that projected that the U.K. variant could become the predominant strain in the country by March.

Lee said case numbers are likely to rise again as the U.K. variant becomes more widespread and as other strains that were first reported in South Africa and Brazil circulate in the U.S. But it's possible that other forces — including increased rates of vaccination across the country, the anticipation that people will spend more time outdoors in the spring and other shifts in behavior — will help counteract a new surge and prevent another wave of runaway outbreaks.

""It was expected that January and February were going to be tough months, because of winter and because of the holidays, but by March or April, we may start to see things improving,"" Lee said.

For one, spring will bring warmer temperatures to much of the country, making it easier to spend time outdoors, where the risk of infection is thought to be lower.

And improvements are likely to continue as more Americans are vaccinated, Griffin said.

Early results from Israel, where more than a third of the population has received at least the first of two vaccine doses, provide the first real-time glimpses that efforts to administer shots rapidly and widely appear to be working. Preliminary analyses show that the vaccines appear to be contributing to sharp declines in infections and illness, particularly in people over age 60, who were among the first to get the shots.

Israel has administered more than 60 doses of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for every 100 residents, far outpacing every other country. (Israel's vaccine strategy has come under fire for excluding Palestinians.)

Figures released last week by Israel's Health Ministry indicated that out of nearly 750,000 people over 60 who were fully vaccinated, only 0.07 percent, or 531 people, tested positive for the virus. Of that group, 38 people were hospitalized for moderate or severe illness.

Griffin said the early results from Israel's vaccine program were ""very encouraging,"" adding that vaccines could at least stave off serious disease and deaths in the U.S., even if the variants cause an overall rise in cases.

The rollout of vaccines in the U.S. was hampered early on by supply constraints and a lack of overall strategy during the Trump administration. Since then, the federal government under President Joe Biden has been trying to ease bottlenecks in manufacturing and distribution, and it is expanding how and where vaccinations can be administered. The efforts are part of Biden's goal of giving at least 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office. As of Sunday, the U.S. had administered 40 million doses, according to the CDC.

Experts have said the U.S. is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible before more troublesome variants emerge, but there are ways to mitigate outbreaks even as people wait to become eligible for the shots, said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington.

""Throughout the course of the pandemic, one of the most important drivers has been changes in our collective behavior,"" Bergstrom said. ""That's what makes modeling the long-term trajectory of the pandemic so extraordinarily difficult.""

""Throughout the course of the pandemic, one of the most important drivers has been changes in our collective behavior."" Carl Bergstrom, professor of biology at the University of Washington

Indeed, behavioral changes have at times been associated both with spikes in cases, as people adopted more lax attitudes and states rolled back restrictions, and with valleys, as new measures were put in place and people became more vigilant.

The dynamic was largely to blame for the alarming surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Los Angeles County, California, in December and January.

To avoid another spike in the spring, the U.S. has to stay aggressive with vaccinations and mitigation tactics, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, Bergstrom said. These strategies are even more crucial to combat more transmissible variants of the coronavirus, he said. The U.K. strain has already been reported in more than half of the states, but as in the U.K., the numbers could increase rapidly.

""That's just how exponential growth works,"" Bergstrom said. ""It comes in at a low frequency, and the first few doublings you don't really notice because it's overwhelmed by what you're seeing with the regular strain. But when it shifts, it shifts quite suddenly, and then you really see it take off.""

That prospect is why many experts approach the recent declines with cautious optimism. Also of concern is the possibility that progress could be wiped out if a strain emerges that evades the current vaccines. Some early research has already shown that the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are less effective against the South African variant, although levels of neutralizing antibodies are expected to still be protective.

It's also possible, Bergstrom said, that other problematic variants are already circulating in the U.S. undetected.

All of those factors combine to make it difficult to assess where the U.S. stands and to predict how the coming months could play out, he said.

""There are so many moving parts, and it's so complicated,"" Bergstrom said, ""but whatever we can do to stay aggressive, the more people we can get vaccinated and the longer we can hang in there, the more we can stave off a huge spring spike."""

The WHO was central to global health during the Cold War era, with a prominent role for the U.S. CDC too, but new entities—including new national and regional CDCs based on the U.S. model—have reshaped the landscape of global health.","ready, pandemic, disease, publichealth, global, countries, health, covid19, goal, fund, world",pandemic,pandemic,"Fast forward to 2023. The Covid-19 pandemic is largely behind us. Most of the world has been vaccinated, though we have to tamp down occasional flare-ups and people sometimes still wear masks. While we mourn the millions who died, we have entered a post-pandemic world in which most things are more or less as they were before Covid-19. Travel and trade are unrestricted; everything from dinner parties and big weddings to stadium concerts and megachurch services are being held again; and economies are booming to keep pace with pent-up demand.

Then, just as suddenly as Covid-19 emerged, disease detectives discover a fresh cluster of a new, pneumonia-like illness. Testing quickly confirms that it isn’t a variant of Covid-19 but a new influenza virus that jumped—somehow, somewhere—from birds to humans. The new virus is as infectious as the one that caused Covid-19 but four times as deadly. And unlike Covid-19, but like the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic, the new virus is particularly deadly to young adults—and, in this case, also to children.

A horrifying influenza pandemic isn’t the only nightmare scenario that could be worse than Covid-19. Think of the hundreds of thousands of cases of tick-borne Lyme disease in the U.S. each year. In other parts of the world, some ticks spread Ebola-like illnesses, and if these infections spread to the U.S., tick-bites could also lead to a disease with the terrifying lethality of Ebola. Or a highly drug-resistant bacterium could spread rapidly. Or a laboratory could develop an untreatable, vaccine-defying strain of a virus or bacterium and—intentionally or by accident—release it into the world.

The world wasn’t ready for Covid-19. Will we be ready for the next, inevitable pandemic?

To prepare, we must start by understanding that the lessons from battling Covid-19 aren’t just about Covid-19. We will fail if we learn nothing more than how to fight the last war better. Now is the time to get ready and to realize that the costs of preparedness will be dwarfed by the price of disaster. Here are six urgent steps the world must take to become far more pandemic-proof.

1. Set a new goal for early warning and response: 7-1-7.

We will have to respond rapidly to any potentially major new health threat. I suggest a goal of “7-1-7”: Every country should be able to identify any new suspected outbreak within seven days of emergence, start to investigate the event within one day and report it then, and mount an effective response—defined by clear, specific benchmarks for different pathogens—within seven days.

These goals will help governments focus attention and resources. Part of the reluctance to fund health preparedness has been a lack of simple measurements of progress. One reason for the broad bipartisan support for the global battles against HIV and malaria has been the appeal, to American politicians and voters alike, of clear metrics: the numbers of people treated, bed-nets distributed, lives saved. For HIV, the goal has been what the U.N. calls “90-90-90”—ensuring that 90% of people infected with HIV know their status, getting sustained treatment to 90% of those diagnosed and suppressing the viral load of 90% of the people on treatment. This strategy has turned concrete, lifesaving outcomes into targets for global action. Meeting the 7-1-7 goal, or something like it, is essential to a safer planet, but it won’t be easy. It will require several other steps.

2. Bolster the capacity of countries to prepare and respond.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have learned a crucial lesson over the past two decades: The best emergency responses use everyday systems that are robust enough to scale up in an emergency. Yet efforts to strengthen such systems are often unfocused. Enhancing countries’ capacities will require substantial resources, robust technical assistance and an insistence on accountability.

As noted in a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a global-health research group at the University of Washington School of Medicine, annual funding for global health in 2019 was an estimated $41 billion (less than 20% of which came from the U.S.). Of that total, the group estimated that less than 1% was for pandemic preparedness—some $374 million.

Credible estimates of the amount needed to boost preparedness (beyond current investments) in low- and middle-income countries start at $5 to 10 billion a year for the next two or three years, continuing for at least a decade. This would come in addition to funding for better research, primary healthcare and other steps essential for progress. This is serious money, but it is dwarfed by the costs of an out-of-control pandemic, as we have all painfully learned.

Many countries will need technical assistance, which can be provided in part by the World Health Organization and its networks, as well as by the U.S. CDC. Such efforts could be complemented by additional regional public-health organizations. For instance, during the Covid-19 crisis, the newly created Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (a public-health agency of the African Union officially launched in 2017) has supported stronger disease-tracking and response systems, as well as a rapid expansion of sorely needed laboratory services on the continent. The European Union announced late last year a 20-fold increase in funding for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (founded in 2004), and discussions are under way about creating similar regional disease-control centers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

Stronger bilateral programs from the U.S., the U.K. and other wealthy countries can also help. China would be likely to follow suit and increase its own global public-health engagement. Structured well, this could be an area for U.S.-Chinese collaboration.

As recent studies in the Lancet and other medical journals have noted, the Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the central importance of primary care. New infectious diseases will be able to spread widely until patients can afford to go to health centers as soon as they feel ill, clinicians are trained to diagnose and report patients with unusual conditions, and health centers can provide accessible treatments and vaccinations. Most countries haven’t invested remotely enough in primary care—including the U.S., which performs abysmally on core measures of primary-care quality. This is a major reason for the rocky U.S. rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations.

But even with more money and better technical assistance, the world won’t be able to meet the 7-1-7 goal unless it is organized for success.

3. Let global institutions focus on what they do best.

As the lead U.N. agency for global public health, the WHO remains the indispensable anchor of such efforts. The organization has obvious limitations: It has often been underfunded, underpowered and reluctant to criticize governments. But it performs several indispensable roles: providing evidence-based public-health guidance, facilitating international collaboration, openly tracking data and helping countries to strengthen their public-health efforts.

The WHO needs real reforms to meet its mission. It must be much better insulated from political and geographic considerations in the hiring and promotion of staff, as well as in its assessments of countries and recommendations to them. A stronger WHO could provide robust technical support to governments world-wide, especially through its proposed Global Strategic Preparedness Network.

As the world faces 21st-century pandemics, its international public-health structures still come largely from post-World War II agreements, with newer entities often grafted awkwardly onto them. The WHO was central to global health during the Cold War era, with a prominent role for the U.S. CDC too, but new entities—including new national and regional CDCs based on the U.S. model—have reshaped the landscape of global health.

The two largest new public-health groups—the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—have a combined budget that is about twice that of the WHO. Some new philanthropies, particularly the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, are also large and influential.

The Global Fund is a major financier of programs to combat the three diseases in its title, while Gavi helps to negotiate and finance vaccines for lower-income countries. Both are international organizations that aren’t part of the U.N. and aren’t under WHO control. They receive their substantial resources from country governments, which have steadily increased their investments in the Global Fund and Gavi because of their efficiency, accountability and impressive results. But both entities were created without strong technical components (in large part to avoid alienating the WHO), and the WHO hasn’t been able to provide sufficient specialized expertise to ensure that Global Fund and Gavi programs reach their potential.

These new entities have brought far more resources, energy and accountability into global health, but they haven’t substantially strengthened laboratory capacity, disease monitoring, primary care and other capacities essential to beating Covid-19 and future pandemics.

4. Get buy-in from wealthier countries and major philanthropies.

By working together to strengthen early-warning systems, share data, improve rapid-response capacities and strengthen health-protection systems world-wide, we can save millions of lives and trillions of dollars. This will cost billions a year, spent by countries large and small, but that pales in comparison to the International Monetary Fund’s October 2020 estimate that Covid-19 has cost the world some $20 trillion. The next pandemic could be even deadlier—and costlier.

The world needs new financial mechanisms for readiness that can administer funds efficiently, offering accountability and boosting confidence for government investments. The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other entities can play important roles. Most important, the Global Fund could both generate and disburse funds for national preparedness. It could offer not just money but specific benchmarks toward the 7-1-7 goal and a new, pandemic-specific structure for ownership and oversight in recipient countries, involving ministries of finance, health, agriculture and more, as well as the private sector and civil-society groups.

5. Persuade the world to respond globally and address dangerous gaps.

“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind,” as the old saying goes. Today, failures of global cooperation worsen the spread of infectious diseases by leaving the world blind to emerging threats. But by working together—by sharing data, knowledge and resources—we can increase our shared safety and security.

One neglected issue is improving laboratory safety. Some lab errors are inevitable, but we have insufficient global standards—and no global oversight—to reduce the risk of unintentional release of deadly pathogens, as may have occurred with influenza from an accidental laboratory release in the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s and is documented to have occurred with smallpox in the U.K. in 1978 and with SARS in China in 2004.

Release of a biological agent could be as deadly as a nuclear war, and we need similarly vigorous systems of standards and inspections to reduce that horrifying risk. Advances in biological science have made it increasingly easy to create dangerous pathogens. A global compact to limit the number of laboratories, personnel and experiments and to more safely manage them could substantially reduce the risk. Even reaching this modest goal would be difficult: It would be expensive, require global agreement, face resistance by researchers, demand inspections and still fail to eliminate the risk of bad actors. But we urgently need it nonetheless.

We must also reduce the risk of diseases spreading from animal populations to humanity. Most dangerous new pathogens emerge from human contact with animals, often because of our encroachment into traditional habitats. A global, enforceable compact, as proposed by Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution and others, would help to end the commercial sale of wild animals for food. In parts of Africa and Asia where bush meat is important to nutrition, we will also need economic measures that make it easier to substitute other locally available sources of protein, and much stronger programs are needed to reduce the risk of influenza spreading from birds and swine to people.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What’s the biggest lesson you think public officials should draw from the pandemic? Join the conversation below.

Finally, the world must increase its manufacturing capacity for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. Pathogens spread, so we cannot leave millions without access to the top-quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines we want for ourselves. The Rand Corp. has warned of the dangers of “vaccine nationalism,” in which “countries push to get first access to a supply of vaccines, potentially hoarding key components for vaccine production.”

Such short-sighted behavior is both ethically indefensible and politically inevitable. One solution would be to increase manufacturing by countries with relatively small populations, which would be able to vaccinate their own populations without having much impact on the overall supply. The world could also work to boost manufacturing capacity through companies that accept global financing in exchange for their agreement to produce reasonably priced products that meet stringent standards and to distribute them in underserved regions.

Exciting new technologies such as mRNA—which made possible the first two Covid-19 vaccines licensed in the U.S.—raise the promise of platforms that can be rapidly repurposed to tackle new threats. Globally supported mRNA production facilities could help end the current pandemic and, potentially, produce lifesaving vaccines and medicines that would create a sustainable business model, with sales to public and private purchasers between pandemics.

But more than all this, we need a new global attitude.

6. Don’t wait.

We must act now: 2021 is the now-or-never moment to improve global resilience in facing future pandemics. We can’t know the character or the timing of the threats ahead, but they are inevitable. There is no time to lose in making preparations.

Public-health decisions are unavoidably political. Failing to act, in the face of Covid-19’s proof that the world is dangerously vulnerable, would also be a decision. This year, when the urgency of such work is so clear, we must make significant investments to protect and expand global health—or we and our children will face the dire consequences.

This report analyzes public opinion in the United States and three major Western European nations: France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The U.S. has suffered the most cases of COVID-19 in the world, though the election of Joe Biden has renewed optimism among the three European publics regarding U.S. policy toward tackling the virus. Each of the three European countries included here have recorded at least 2 million cases of COVID-19, and the virus has surged in the months since the first Center survey on this topic. Previous research showed the U.S. and UK publics are especially polarized on how their nations have dealt with the pandemic. This report examines people’s views of whether their country has handled the outbreak well, the degree of change in their daily lives due to the virus, attitudes toward government-mandated vaccines and optimism about future global health crisis responses. For this analysis, we use data from nationally representative telephone surveys of 4,069 adults from Nov. 10 to Dec. 23, 2020, in the U.S., France, Germany and the UK. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses and the survey.

The novel coronavirus continues to pose weighty challenges for people around the world. Significant shares of the public in the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom say their lives have changed because of the outbreak, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted as vaccines were first being approved for conditional use in the UK and U.S. and restrictions tightened in parts of Europe. And the shares who feel this way have grown notably since summer, when the Center reported already-high levels of impact in people’s lives.

At the same time, as coronavirus case counts soar in each of these four nations, publics are largely split on whether their country has done a good job handling the outbreak. Ideology plays a role in people’s assessments of their national coronavirus response, but this rings especially true in the U.S. and UK, where those on the political left are more critical. Those who feel better about their nation’s economic situation are more likely to give positive reviews of how the virus has been handled thus far.

When looking toward the future, publics in each of the four countries share in the optimism that their nations are well-prepared should there be a future global public health crisis. Feelings of hope are especially strong among those who think their country is currently handling the coronavirus outbreak well, though the U.S. is an exception.

These are among the findings of a new Pew Research Center survey conducted from Nov. 10 to Dec. 23, 2020, among 4,069 adults in the U.S., Germany, France and the UK. The survey also finds that, prior to the coronavirus vaccine rollouts in each of the four nations surveyed, many in these countries did not support government-mandated vaccinations to stop the spread of COVID-19. This is especially true among those with lower levels of trust in their government.

Most say life changed due to coronavirus, a feeling that has increased since the summer

Of the four countries surveyed, majorities in three report their life has changed at least a fair amount due to the coronavirus. Nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults say their life has changed, including 44% who say it has changed a great deal. Across the Atlantic, no fewer than two-thirds of those in the UK and France also say their life has changed because of the outbreak.

Only in Germany do fewer than half of those surveyed say the coronavirus has changed their life, while 52% say their life has not changed much or not changed at all.

However, in three of four countries, women are significantly more likely than men to report their life having changed due to COVID-19. This divide reflects studies that have shown that women have lost jobs at a rate disproportionate to men, while also continuing a trend that Pew Research Center previously observed over the summer. The disparity is largest in the U.S., where 79% of women say their life has been affected, versus 68% of men – a difference of 11 percentage points.

Since the Center last fielded this question in summer 2020, a larger percentage of publics in the U.S., France and Germany have come to say their life has changed in some capacity because of the coronavirus outbreak. The largest increase was seen in France, where 67% now say their life has changed due to the coronavirus, an increase of 21 percentage points from June. Germany also saw an 8-point increase in those saying the pandemic has changed their life a great deal or fair amount.

Americans remain displeased with national response to combat COVID-19

Across the four nations surveyed, responses to the pandemic garner varying levels of approval. In Germany, nearly eight-in-ten say their country has done a good job handling the coronavirus outbreak. In France, more voice support for the national COVID-19 response than do not (54% vs. 46%, respectively).

In the UK, opinion is split on whether their country is doing a good or bad job of dealing with the outbreak. And a 58% majority of Americans say the U.S. is doing a bad job of handling the pandemic.

The U.S. and Germany show waning confidence in their countries’ handling of the pandemic. While 47% of Americans gave the U.S. response to COVID-19 a positive review over the summer, just 41% hold that opinion in the current survey, a 6 percentage point drop from June to November. Over the same period, the share of Germans who say their country has done well handling COVID-19 dropped 11 points. Unlike in the U.S., however, Germans remain overwhelmingly in approval. Opinions in the UK and France stayed relatively stable.

Ideological leanings play a role in how people assess their nation’s coronavirus response. In the U.S., 67% of those on the ideological right say the American handling of COVID-19 has been good, while just 13% on the ideological left say the same – a 54-point difference.

A similar split appears in the UK, which like the U.S. had a right-leaning party in charge of national executive power at the time of the survey. In Germany, those on the left hold more favorable views of their nation’s handling of the pandemic than those on the right, though nearly three-quarters or more still believe the response has been good, regardless of ideology.

Sentiment about the economy likewise relates to how people rate their national coronavirus response. In each of the four countries, those who think their current economic situation is good are significantly more likely than those who think the economy is bad to also believe their country is handling the outbreak well. In the U.S., for instance, while 60% of those who are positive about the economy say the American response to COVID-19 has been good, just 23% of those who think the economy is doing poorly share the same sentiment.

Most feel optimistic about future public health emergency strategies in their country

Although assessments of their country’s handling of COVID-19 vary, publics across the four nations appear hopeful about how their country would fare in future public health crises.

In Germany, about eight-in-ten say they feel generally optimistic about their country’s ability to deal with future global health emergencies. In the other three nations, at least six-in-ten hold the same opinion.

Optimism in three of the four countries relates to how people assess their nation’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. For instance, 83% of French adults who think their country has done a good job in response to COVID-19 also voice optimism about France’s ability to deal with future global health emergencies. Just 35% who think France’s handling of the pandemic has been bad share this optimism for future situations, a 48-point difference.

This is not the case in the U.S., however, where nearly equal shares voice optimism regardless of what they think of the American response to the COVID-19 outbreak. And while Democrats (74%) are more likely to voice optimism for handling future health crises, a majority of Republicans (61%) also hold this view. (Republicans are also slightly less likely to answer this question.)

Few find it acceptable for governments to require coronavirus vaccine; UK the exception

Previous Pew Research Center polling shows that domestically, six-in-ten Americans intend to get a coronavirus vaccine. But most in France strongly oppose the idea of requiring a coronavirus vaccine, and majorities in the U.S. and Germany share this sentiment.

For example, only 41% of those surveyed in the U.S. say that if a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine is developed, it is acceptable for the national government to require people to get said vaccine. Those in France are even less willing; a full three-quarters of the French say it is unacceptable for the national government to mandate coronavirus vaccination.

Britons, on the other hand, are more willing to allow the government to instate such a program, with 62% of those surveyed saying it is acceptable to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations. (Vaccines were at various stages of approval in these four countries during the survey period, but no government in these four countries currently plans to require mandatory vaccinations at the national level.)

Trust in national government is associated with more acceptance of a government-required COVID-19 vaccination program. In both Germany and the UK, there is a difference of 17 percentage points on the issue between those who do and do not trust the national government to do what is right for their country. The U.S. and France also exhibit a similar pattern. While only one-third of Americans who do not trust their government say it is acceptable to require vaccination, nearly half of Americans who do trust the national government say it is acceptable for the government to do so.

In the UK, France and Germany, views on nationally mandating the coronavirus vaccine do not vary across the political spectrum. In the U.S., however, large ideological differences arise. While 60% of liberals believe it acceptable for the national government to require Americans to get vaccinated, just 28% of conservatives share that opinion, a 32-point difference."

As we enter year two of the pandemic, let’s remind ourselves of some sobering statistics. So far, there have been more than 117.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world; more than 2.6 million people have died. A total of 221 countries and territories have been affected. Some 12 of the 14 countries and territories reporting no cases are small Pacific or Atlantic islands.

Whether the race to end the pandemic will be a sprint or a marathon remains to be seen, as does the extent of the gap between rich and poor contestants. However, as vaccines roll out across the world, it seems we are collectively just out of the starting blocks.

Here are the challenges we face over the next 12 months if we are to ever begin to reduce COVID-19 to a sporadic or endemic disease.

Vaccines are like walking on the Moon

Developing safe and effective vaccines in such a short time frame was a mission as ambitious, and with as many potential pitfalls, as walking on the Moon.

Miraculously, 12 months since a pandemic was declared, eight vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been approved by at least one country. A ninth, Novavax, is very promising. So far, more than 312 million people have been vaccinated with at least one dose.

While most high-income countries will have vaccinated their populations by early 2022, 85 poor countries will have to wait until 2023.

This implies the world won’t be back to normal travel, trade and supply chains until 2024 unless rich countries take actions — such as waiving vaccine patents, diversifying production of vaccines and supporting vaccine delivery — to help poor countries catch up.

The vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19. However, we need to continue to study the vaccines after being rolled out (conducting so-called post-implementation studies) in 2021 and beyond. This is to determine how long protection lasts, whether we need booster doses, how well vaccines work in children and the impact of vaccines on viral transmission.

What should make us feel optimistic is that in countries that rolled out the vaccines early, such as the UK and Israel, there are signs the rate of new infections is in decline.

What are the potential barriers to overcome?

One of the most salutary lessons we have learnt in the pandemic’s first year is how dangerous it is to let COVID-19 transmission go unchecked. The result is the emergence of more transmissible variants that escape our immune responses, high rates of excess mortality and a stalled economy.

Until we achieve high levels of population immunity via vaccination, in 2021 we must maintain individual and societal measures, such as masks, physical distancing, and hand hygiene; improve indoor ventilation; and strengthen outbreak responses — testing, contact tracing and isolation.

However, there are already signs of complacency and much misinformation to counter, especially for vaccine uptake. So we must continue to address both these barriers.

The outcomes of even momentary complacency are evident as global numbers of new cases once again increase after a steady two month decline. This recent uptick reflects surges in many European countries, such as Italy, and Latin American countries like Brazil and Cuba. New infections in Papua New Guinea have also risen alarmingly in the past few weeks.

Some fundamental questions also remain unanswered. We don’t know how long either natural or vaccine-induced immunity will last. However, encouraging news from the US reveals 92-98% of COVID-19 survivors had adequate immune protection six to eight months after infection. In 2021, we will continue to learn more about how long natural and vaccine-induced immunity lasts.

New variants may be the greatest threat

The longer the coronavirus circulates widely, the higher the risk of more variants of concern emerging. We are aware of B.1.1.7 (the variant first detected in the UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil).

But other variants have been identified. These include B.1.427, which is now the dominant, more infectious, strain in California and one identified recently in New York, named B.1.526.

Variants may transmit more readily than the original Wuhan strain of the virus and may lead to more cases. Some variants may also be resistant to vaccines, as has already been demonstrated with the B.1.351 strain. We will continue to learn more about the impact of variants on disease and vaccines in 2021 and beyond.

A year from now

Given so many unknowns, how the world will be in March 2022 would be an educated guess. However, what is increasingly clear is there will be no “mission accomplished” moment. We are at a crossroads with two end games.

In the most likely scenario, rich countries will return to their new normal. Businesses and schools will reopen and internal travel will resume. Travel corridors will be established between countries with low transmission and high vaccine coverage. This might be between Singapore and Taiwan, between Australia and Vietnam, and maybe between all four, and more countries.

Read more: Even with a vaccine, we need to adjust our mindset to playing the COVID-19 long game

In low- and middle-income countries, there may be a reduction in severe cases, freeing them to rehabilitate health services that have suffered in the past 12 months. These include maternal, newborn, and child health services, including reproductive health; tuberculosis, HIV and malaria programs; and nutrition. However, reviving these services will need rich countries to commit generous and sustained aid.

The second scenario, which sadly is unlikely to occur, is unprecedented global cooperation with a focus on science and solidarity to halt transmission everywhere.

This is a fragile moment in modern world history. But, in record time, we have developed effective tools to eventually control this pandemic. The path to a post-COVID-19 future can perhaps now be characterised as a hurdle race but one that presents severe handicaps to the world’s poorest nations. As an international community, we have the capacity to make it a level playing field."

At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear – to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security.

Today we hold the same hope that, as we fight to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic together, we can build a more robust international health architecture that will protect future generations.

There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.

We are, therefore, committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics.

Immunisation is a global public good and we will need to be able to develop, manufacture and deploy vaccines as quickly as possible.

This is why the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) was set up in order to promote equal access to tests, treatments and vaccines and support health systems across the globe. ACT-A has delivered on many aspects, but equitable access is not achieved yet. There is more we can do to promote global access.

To that end, we believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response. Such a renewed collective commitment would be a milestone in stepping up pandemic preparedness at the highest political level. It would be rooted in the constitution of the World Health Organisation, drawing in other relevant organisations key to this endeavour, in support of the principle of health for all.

Existing global health instruments, especially the International Health Regulations, would underpin such a treaty, ensuring a firm and tested foundation on which we can build and improve.

The main goal of this treaty would be to foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment.

It would also include recognition of a “One Health” approach that connects the health of humans, animals and our planet. And such a treaty should lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and co-operation within the international system and with its rules and norms.

To achieve this, we will work with heads of state and governments globally, and all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector. We are convinced that it is our responsibility, as leaders of nations and international institutions, to ensure that the world learns the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic.

At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful co-operation that extends beyond this crisis. Building our capacities and systems to do this will take time and require a sustained political, financial and societal commitment over many years.

Our solidarity in ensuring that the world is better prepared will be our legacy that protects our children and grandchildren and minimises the impact of future pandemics on our economies and our societies.

Pandemic preparedness needs global leadership for a global health system fit for this millennium. To make this commitment a reality, we must be guided by solidarity, fairness, transparency, inclusiveness and equity.

As the world battles the biggest health crisis in recent history, leaders of 23 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) have said an international treaty for pandemic preparedness will protect future generations.

The idea of such a treaty, aimed at tightening rules on sharing information and ensuring universal and equitable access to vaccines, as well as medicines and diagnostics for pandemics, was first floated late last year by European Council President Charles Michel.

On Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and several world leaders – including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame – threw their support behind the proposal.

“The world cannot afford to wait until the pandemic is over to start planning for the next one,” Tedros told reporters.

He said the treaty would be rooted in the UN health agency’s constitution.

‘Learn the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic’

The leaders of Fiji, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Kenya, Greece, South Korea, Chile, Costa Rica, Albania, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the Netherlands, Tunisia, Senegal, Spain, Norway, Serbia, Indonesia and Ukraine also lent their support to the idea.

“There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone,” the leaders wrote in a joint opinion piece published in newspapers across the world.

“We believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.”

The treaty would also state that the health of humans, animals and the planet are all connected and should lead to shared responsibility, transparency and cooperation globally.

“We are convinced that it is our responsibility, as leaders of nations and international institutions, to ensure that the world learns the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the leaders wrote.

However, although their proposal called for “solidarity”, there was no indication any country would soon change its own approach to responding to the pandemic.

There were also few details to explain how such an agreement might actually force countries to act more cooperatively.

Questions over enforcement

The leaders of China and the United States did not sign the letter, but Tedros said both powers had responded positively to the proposal, and all states would be represented in talks.

Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said the absence of their formal support had raised a “big question” over how the treaty might be enforced.

“So far there are some major omissions such as the United States, Russia and China, and without those countries on board, it would be very hard to see how such a treaty could have the clout that it would need on the international stage,” she said.

International regulations governing health and implemented by the WHO already exist – and can be disregarded by countries with few consequences.

Despite an obligation for nations to share critical epidemic data and materials quickly with WHO, for example, China declined to do so when the coronavirus first broke out.

Former US President Donald Trump criticised the WHO for its handling of the first wave and his administration accused the agency of helping China shield the extent of its outbreak. WHO has rejected the accusation as false.

Vaccine inequity

Steven Solomon, WHO’s principal legal officer, said the treaty would need to be ratified by legislators in the participating countries.

“Specifics about enforcement will be up to member states to decide on,” he said.

Issues such as the sharing of vaccine technology and vaccine supplies could be included, according to Solomon, but he gave no indication how that might happen.

Despite WHO’s calls for patents to be waived during the pandemic, rich countries have opposed efforts by developing countries to compel them to share vaccine manufacturing technology.

Tedros called on wealthy countries last week to immediately donate 10 million COVID-19 vaccines so that immunisation campaigns could start in all countries within the first 100 days of the year.

No single country has yet publicly offered to share its vaccines immediately. Of the more than 459 million vaccines administered globally, the majority have been in just 10 countries."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images

The nation's homeless population grew last year for the fourth year in a row. On a single night in January 2020, there were more than 580,000 individuals who were homeless in the United States, a 2% increase from the year before.

The numbers, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development Thursday, do not reflect the impact of the pandemic.

""And we know the pandemic has only made the homelessness crisis worse,"" HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a video message accompanying the report. She called the numbers ""devastating"" and said the nation has a ""moral responsibility to end homelessness.""

Among the report's more sobering findings: homelessness among veterans and families did not improve for the first time in many years.

Also, more than 106,000 children were homeless during the once-a-year count, conducted in most communities across the nation. While the majority of homeless children were in shelters or transitional housing, almost 11,000 were living outside.

As has been the case for years, a disproportionate share of those experiencing homelessness were Black — about 39% of the total, though African Americans make up about 13% of the nation's overall population. Twenty-three percent of those who were homeless last year identified as Hispanic or Latino.

California was home to the largest number of people experiencing homelessness — 161,548 — according to the 2020 count. A quarter of all homeless individuals in the United States were living in either New York City or Los Angeles.

For the first time since the government began doing the annual count, the number of single adults living outside — 209,413 — exceeded the number of individuals living in shelters — 199,478.

""I think it's tragic that we have increasing unsheltered numbers,"" said Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. ""We know that unsheltered people have horrible health conditions."" Roman noted that these individuals are much more susceptible to disease and premature death than those living inside.

Adding to the concern of housing advocates are signs that many more individuals have moved outside since the count was conducted because of the pandemic.

Some individuals have been worried about contracting COVID-19 staying inside, and many shelters have been forced to limit bed space to meet health and safety protocols. This has led to an increase in street homelessness in communities that were unable to provide alternative housing, although some have taken advantage of hotel space left empty during the pandemic.

Becky Gligo, executive director of Housing Solutions Tulsa, said her Oklahoma county raised money to move more than 400 unsheltered individuals into a hotel or other housing after a major storm hit the area this winter, leaving fewer than a dozen people on the streets.

""The pandemic has been incredibly hard on everybody for so many reasons. But in some ways, it's really fast-tracked things that we thought would take five, 10 years to get the funding and intention for,"" Gligo said.

Other providers have also seen what they describe as a silver lining to the pandemic.

John Mendez, executive director of Bethesda Cares, a service provider in Montgomery County, Md., said his group was able to permanently house some individuals who had lived outside for more than a decade and refused to accept assistance until last year.

""Many of them were very scared of what could happen,"" Mendez said. ""It was very desolate.""

Streets that were usually bustling were suddenly empty. Conveniences, such as bathroom facilities, were no longer available. ""By the end of April, they were open to talking about housing for the first time,"" he said.

Still concerns have grown about what might lie ahead.

""I think we're going to see homelessness increase,"" said Sean Read, chief program officer at Friendship Place, a nonprofit that serves homeless individuals in Washington, D.C. Homelessness is ""generally a delayed response"" to economic setbacks, Read noted. Families that have been able to hold on to housing during the pandemic, with the help of government aid and eviction moratoriums, could find themselves out of luck in the coming year.

Read and other providers are hopeful that billions of dollars in housing aid included in a recent $1.9 trillion COVID relief package will go a long way toward alleviating the crisis.

The amount of aid is unprecedented. The bill provides $5 billion in homelessness assistance, more than $20 billion in emergency rental aid and $5 billion in new housing vouchers.

Roman, of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, noted that the measure also includes direct payments for families, which could keep many in their homes. She said some communities are also planning to use the funds to buy empty hotels that can be used to house more individuals, both temporarily and permanently.

""It's such a huge opportunity at the moment,"" Roman said. ""The question is are we going to be able to seize it."""

The economic crisis driven by the novel coronavirus is having a major impact on global living standards, pushing millions of people out of the middle class or into poverty. India and China, the world’s third largest and largest economies, respectively, exert significant influence on these trends. But the pandemic’s economic impact on India and China has been very different.

Given that India and China also account for more than a third of the global population, with about 1.4 billion people each, the course of the pandemic in these two countries – and how each recovers – will have a substantial effect on changes in the distribution of income at the global level.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an economic crisis, shuttering businesses and cutting jobs around the world. This analysis looks at how the downturn has affected the standard of living in India and China, the two most populous countries in the world. The focus is on the distribution of people across five income tiers in 2020: poor, low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income. See the methodology and an earlier Pew Research Center report for more on the definition and meaning of these tiers in a global context. The key data source for the analysis is the World Bank’s PovcalNet database, which provides access to household survey data on either income or consumption for more than 160 countries. The latest year for which survey data on the numbers of people in each income tier are available is 2011 for India and 2016 for China. These benchmark estimates are extrapolated to 2020 using World Bank estimates of output growth through 2020. One projection is based on the World Bank’s January 2020 forecasts of economic growth in 2020, and the other is based on its January 2021 estimates of growth in 2020. The difference between these two measures is used to represent the effect of the pandemic on the income distribution in each country.

While India plunged into a deep recession in 2020, China was able to forestall a contraction. In January 2020, economic forecasts from the World Bank pointed to virtually the same growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in India (5.8%) and China (5.9%) in 2020. In January 2021, nearly one year into the pandemic, the World Bank revised these growth estimates downward to -9.6% for India but forecast 2% growth for China.

A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that the middle class in India is estimated to have shrunk by 32 million in 2020 as a consequence of the downturn, compared with the number it may have reached absent the pandemic. This accounts for 60% of the global retreat in the number of people in the middle-income tier (defined here as people with incomes of $10.01-$20 a day).

Meanwhile, the number of people who are poor in India (with incomes of $2 or less a day) is estimated to have increased by 75 million because of the COVID-19 recession. This, too, accounts for nearly 60% of the global increase in poverty. Perhaps not surprisingly, media reports from India point to a spike in participation in its rural employment program – originally intended to combat poverty in agricultural areas – as the many who have lost jobs in the reeling economy seek work. The number now participating is setting record highs in the program’s 14-year history.

The change in living standards in China is more modest than in India. The largest impact in China is the estimated addition of 30 million people to the low-income tier (incomes of $2.01-$10 a day). The number of people in the middle-income tier likely decreased by 10 million, and poverty was virtually unchanged.

Defining the income tiers The population in each country is divided into five groups: poor, low income, middle income, upper-middle income and high income. The poor live on $2 or less daily, low income on $2.01-$10, middle income on $10.01-$20, upper-middle income on $20.01-$50 and high income on more than $50. All dollar figures are expressed in 2011 prices and purchasing power parity dollars, currency exchange rates adjusted for differences in the prices of goods and services across countries. The assignment to a group, or income tier, is based on a household’s daily per capita income or consumption, a simple way of controlling for differences in household size. The terms “income” and “consumption” are used interchangeably for the sake of convenience, as are the terms “middle income” and “middle class.” An earlier Pew Research Center report discusses these concepts and the choice of income thresholds in greater detail.

The contrast in how living standards have evolved in India and China amid the pandemic is starker in the context of where they stood prior to the pandemic.

Prior to the pandemic, it was anticipated that 99 million people in India would belong in the global middle class in 2020. A year into the pandemic, this number is estimated to be have been 66 million, cut by a third. Meanwhile, the number of poor in India is projected to have reached 134 million, more than double the 59 million expected prior to the recession. The poverty rate in India likely rose to 9.7% in 2020, up sharply from the January 2020 forecast of 4.3%.

Most people in India were in the global low-income tier in 2020. Some 1.20 billion people in India were expected to be in this tier in 2020 prior to the pandemic, accounting for 30% of the world’s low-income population. This number is projected to have dropped to 1.16 billion as the COVID-19 downturn pushed more people into poverty.

In China, there are more people in the global middle- and upper-middle income tiers than in poverty and the low-income tier. Although about 10 million people in China are estimated to have fallen out of the middle class in the downturn, this is a small share of the 504 million who were in the middle class ahead of the pandemic. Likewise, the expansion of the low-income tier in China from 611 million to 641 million or the number of poor from 3 million to 4 million during the pandemic is comparatively modest in number.

Importantly, China accounted for 37% of the global middle-income population heading into 2020. Because economic growth in China remained positive, even if slower than anticipated, the limited impact on its middle class helped to ease the strain on the global middle class.

For both India and China, the drop in living standards in 2020 is a sharp departure from recent trends. From 2011 to 2019, the number of poor in India is estimated to have decreased from 340 million to 78 million. The projected rise in poverty in 2020 when comparing pre-pandemic and revised figures – 75 million – claws back several years of progress on this front for India. The retreat of India’s middle class in 2020 – by 32 million – also looms large in the context of the addition of 57 million to this income tier from 2011 to 2019.

In China, there had been a sizable addition of 247 million people to the middle-income tier from 2011 to 2019. Meanwhile, the upper-middle income population had nearly quadrupled, from 60 million to 234 million. On both fronts, China alone had accounted for the majority of the increase in these tiers globally. Thus, the pandemic-driven pause on these fronts in China is also a letup for the world at large.

Speaking to VOA Africa's Linord Moudou via Skype, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said equitable distribution of the vaccine is key. Below is an edited transcript.

VOA: Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, thank you so much for joining us today.

TEDROS: Thank you. Thank you very much for having me.

VOA: On January 30, 2020, you yourself declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern. WHO described it as a pandemic on March 11. What are your thoughts on the experience this past year with COVID-19?

TEDROS: Thank you. Thank you very much. First of all, the highest level of public health emergency is what we declared on January 30. And as you know, we have the international health regulations, and in that regulation, the highest level is what we declared on January 30. What we did, as you said, in March, is describing, you know the situation, since it was really increasing in terms of geography that, you know countries affected, and also in terms of the number of cases.

And the lessons learned, I think: One very important lesson is, you know, the importance of investment in public health. When I say public health, it covers many of the aspects that we are saying now, which are very important for emergency preparedness and response.

As you may know, and as you know, many countries, high-income countries, were surprised by the pandemic because they have been investing in medicine, in secondary, tertiary services, subspecialty services. But their investment in primary health care, in public health, the basic of public health, was really minimal. So countries should really give attention to public health to primary health care in order to prepare for the future and also finish this pandemic.

And the other important lesson from the last one year is when politics and science is not aligned, there is a danger. In some countries, we have seen that the expert advice goes one side while the political decisions were going the other side. And that was actually helping the virus to spread.

So it's very important that we don't politicize outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. And the political support or the political commitment should be aligned with the, you know, with science and expert opinion.

And then the other important element is a lesson in the past year, not only the national capacity in terms of preparedness and focus on signs and helping politics to support signs, but also the global coordination has to be strengthened. And also you know when we say global coordination, starting from early strengthening, from early warning systems.

And the other lesson could be the One Health approach [in which, as the U.N. explains, “multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes”]. As you know, this virus — of course, it's being studied — could have originated from animals or it could be other. But in any way, it's within the animal, human and the environment interaction that, you know, new diseases could emerge. So taking the One Health approach seriously is very important.

So these are some of the lessons, of course, the many lessons we have learned. If I continue to outline, it will be a very, very long list. But one thing I would like to say is before even COVID, we were we have started transformation in WHO. And based on this experience, we will add more ideas to improve our system.

And we have many mechanisms now, several mechanisms that is helping us to evaluate the situation in this pandemic and understand the lessons and then incorporate them into our systems, be it at national, regional or global level for future preparedness.

VOA: OK, now let's talk about how countries are experiencing COVID-19, specifically [in] Africa. Although the continent has not been spared by the deadly coronavirus, Africa has seen fewer cases of infections and deaths compared to the rest of the world. What do you make of that?

TEDROS: Thank you, that's a very important question. I think the combination of many factors actually helps. One, the population is young, so a young population. And second, Africa actually started as early as possible, you know, preparing itself and responding, so that early, quick action really helped that, too.

And then the third is the early action was not just individual country-level only, but it was a continental-wide, coordinated effort. That also helps. And the fourth is, Africa, our continent is regularly challenged by many infectious diseases. It could be yellow fever or meningitis, cholera, Ebola, you name it. So the primary health care or the public health system is better prepared so it can respond faster. So these are the four, I think, reasons that that probably helped Africa to be better compared to other regions.

VOA: Now, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was appointed as the African Union champion for the COVID-19 response. The country has been hardest hit in Africa by COVID. What is the significance of this appointment for the response on the continent?

TEDROS: Thank you. By the way, instead of starting from his appointment as champion, maybe we need to go back and see what he did to be chosen champion. I mean, I can say that he earned that position or that championship because of what he did in the past one year.

One of the reasons I said, you know why Africa did better is because of the quick action, and this would not have been possible without his leadership. As you know, the past year he has been chairing the African Union. And I remember the first meeting the ministers of health had — the continental ministers of health of the African Union — was in February 20 [2020]. I attended that meeting and to design a continental strategy.

During that time, there was only one confirmed case, I think in Egypt. So the rest was still OK and no reported cases. And he [Ramaphosa] pushed for that early, quick response and that meeting resulted into a continental strategy. And then he formed a bureau of leadership that's composed of regional leaders from all corners of our continent. I attended also a couple of these meetings. And then he immediately appointed special envoys that can take care of the supply of medicine, mobilizing resources, and people who can lead in other efforts — very renowned Africans, actually, as special envoys.

And he was coordinating that as chair of the African Union. And his, you know, continental leadership was very, very significant and it really helped Africa to fare better. But not only continental. But he also was leading the global effort, as you know, South Africa and Norway. President Ramaphosa and Prime Minister Erna Solberg, co-chair of the Facilitation Council of the Accelerator, and he contributed also to the global response. [Full name is Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Facilitation Council.]

So, I mean, now he's designated as a champion. And it's well deserved because of what he did and with the understanding that he will continue to do, but I'm really proud of him. I'm very proud of President Ramaphosa and what he did. And that's why Africa really fared well. And I know through this appointment he will continue to lead with his colleagues, heads of state, head of government leaders in our continent.

VOA: And speaking of the way things are being done on the continent, Dr. Ghebreyesus, how do you assess COVID response in Africa?

TEDROS: I think the COVID response is going OK. The first wave was the better for our continent, for Africa, actually. The second phase was more serious and that started in January 2021. And then there was a period of, starting from late January, [infections] started to decline. And now we see some tendency again to increase.

I think the focus from this what we can understand is that the focus on the made the basic public health measures should continue. We need to do the basic things, like what we have been doing: You know, the use of masks, you know, the physical distancing, the hand hygiene, and we need to continue to do that. And we need to continue our surveillance. Also, we need to find where the virus is and try to address it, you know, attack it, continue to attack. So continuing with the public health measures will be important.

But I have some concern that there is a slight increase now. It's not a significant one, but the tendency should be taken seriously. But this is not just for Africa alone. If you see the global trend, it was declining until mid-March. Now we can see the last three weeks, some slight increase.

So the trend globally and in Africa is almost the same with a slight trend in the, you know, on the increase. This could be explained in many ways. As I said, maybe some countries are lowering their guard that they have to be very careful. Second, it's going to be the variant.

And there could be other issues, so we have to understand why. But at least we have to continue to implement the proven public health measures while addressing the other additional challenges we're facing.

VOA: How concerned should we be about the variants? How much of an impact is it having on the global strategy?

TEDROS: We have to be really concerned because the concern we have is, of course there is a variant report from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. But one question is: Are these the only variants we have? And the other question is, you know, whatever number of variants we have, you know, are the vaccines we have now really effective?

And then the third question is, you know, how is the behavior of the virus changing with the changing variants? Is it becoming more lethal or is it becoming less so? I think continuing to understand, you know, the variants is very important, starting from the surveillance to find out as early as possible when we have variants, understand what their behavior is in terms of their transmissibility and severity of disease.

And then we have to understand also in terms of the effectiveness of the vaccines that we use. And we have a network now that's coordinated by WHO and we're trying to strengthen the surveillance system and also studying the other things which I have already said. But it's a serious concern — and with mutation, as you know, there could be more challenges ahead of us.

VOA: So you mentioned the vaccine. We're seeing the vaccine being deployed around the world. What do you make of the access to vaccines across the board, especially in Africa and developing countries? And the impact of COVAX?

TEDROS: The COVAX started, as you may know, with two objectives. And two objectives were, one, to accelerate the development of products like vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; and the second objective was to, you know, [facilitate] fair distribution [of those products].

I think the first objective is achieved as you know, in less than a year, we have proven vaccines and, you know, diagnostics and also treatments. The second objective, especially fair distribution, is facing some challenges, especially with regard to vaccines.

The first challenge was high-income countries — some high-income countries, not all — started vaccination in mid-December, while the first [lower-income] country, for instance, that started, that received the vaccine, which is Ghana, is in late February. So there is almost how many? Three months' gap, three months' delay. That's one problem.

That's a problem of vaccine equity. And from the WHO side we were raising the alarm, saying this is not right and we should really share and the only way to end this pandemic is by making everybody safe. So equity of vaccines is in the interest of all of us, in the interest of all countries.

So anyway, we started now the vaccination also in low-income countries. And the number of countries who are receiving the vaccines through COVAX is actually on the increase.

So in our continent, I think so far we have around 20 I think have received [vaccines]. And the target we have is before April 7. April 7 is when we will observe the World Health Day to have at least all countries start vaccination and vaccinating their health workers and elderly. We have 31 days to go, I think — 31 days, yes? And we hope all countries in Africa, other regions will start before then. We have that target.

And the second challenge is the number of people who are being vaccinated in the rest of — in especially high-income countries is on the increase, while the Africa and countries in, you know, low-income countries in other continents are only starting. So we're … expecting that another challenge ahead of us because even with the start of the vaccine, the low-income countries may get less. And their coverage — in terms of coverage, population coverage of vaccination — could be significantly lower than [in] the high-income countries and the gaps could be big. So we are now working on narrowing the gap by increasing production.

And production can be increased by, you know, making use of all the manufacturing capacity we have globally.

We have never, you know, we have never experienced anything like this. You know, it's really unprecedented. And all options should be used, including intellectual — waiver of intellectual property. If we cannot use it now, then when?

As you know, if we go back and try to see anything like this is 100 years ago in 1918, to be correct 103 years ago when we had the 1918 flu which immediately after the [First] World War that affected the whole world and killed tens of millions of people, estimated is between 50 to 100 million. And now we are seeing another unprecedented pandemic. So whatever we have, we have to give it and to increase production and narrow the gaps of rates of vaccination between the haves and have nots. So we will continue to advocate for that. But the world should really give whatever it has in order to finish this pandemic as soon as possible so that people can get back their lives and livelihoods.

It's affecting the whole world and the whole world can only lift up together. If there are areas where the response is weak — because, for instance, lack of equity of vaccines — then the virus will get a chance to circle. And that's why I said it's in the interest of everybody to use whatever means we have to end this pandemic.

VOA: Dr. Tedros, having access to vaccine is one thing. Getting the people to get vaccinated is another thing. There've been a lot of issues around vaccinations globally and in Africa. What do you make of vaccine hesitancy, distrust even, and what can be done about it?

TEDROS: Yeah, you're right, I mean there is vaccine hesitancy in many countries. And I think there is a reason to study even in Africa that the people who say they can take the vaccine right away are around 70 percent. So we need to understand why those who don't want to take the vaccines are saying this. Most of it could be because of misinformation and disinformation. And we have to address that.

And we have a very strong partnership now with the tech industry and to address some of the misinformation which is circulating in the social media. So trusted resources can have the presence in the social media so people get the right information. And the other is, you know, leaders should be at the forefront to show that these vaccines are safe and effective. And I have seen many leaders — heads of state, heads of government in our continent — who have been taking the vaccinations, you know, at the launching of the vaccination [campaign], which is which really encourages the citizens to follow their leaders. So I think this way we can address the hesitancy.

But for now, to be honest with you, more than the hesitancy, the problem I see is the lack of vaccine equity. So the No. 1 challenge is, you know, having the vaccine. So if we can have the vaccines and if there is equitable distribution of the vaccines and, you know, Africa gets its right share and other countries in developing countries in other regions also get their share, that's the most important for me and that will be my priority, to be honest.

And the hesitancy can be addressed. So let's have the vaccines and also if we can fight the hesitancy.

VOA: And finally, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the U.S. recently rejoined the WHO after an exit by the previous administration. What are your thoughts on this decision and how big a difference will the U.S. return make in the fight against COVID as a whole?

TEDROS: The decision by the U.S. government, the new administration, is very, very crucial, actually. And, you know, on January 20, the president had signed the letter and I received the letter actually the morning of January 21. And then I had a call from the vice president. And Dr. [Anthony] Tony Fauci attended the board meeting to also, you know, present the same message.

And so this is very, very telling how committed the administration is to global health and to multilateralism. And this will be very important for the whole world because the leadership and the global role of the U.S. is very, very crucial.

So it's good for the world for global health, and it's good for the U.S. also. Because the U.S., by working with others, can be better protected and it's good for WHO, too, to do its job.

But coming back to the first one, its global role and global leadership, as you know, HIV AIDS pandemic was a major global health problem and the U.S. leadership and support and the global role was very crucial, as you know through the president's PEPFAR initiative on HIV, when, you know, drugs were made available actually to developing countries and also support in other ways and also through Global Fund. The US contribution to Global Fund was a third of the total volume. So it makes a difference.

But not just the finance, but its role, its leadership is really key and it has shown it in the past and in the pandemic now, this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the U.S. will play its global role, too, and that's what we are seeing now, and we have good engagement, good partnership, a very constructive one, and we hope the world will benefit from it — and the U.S. will also benefit from it, because it's by working with others that U.S. citizens could also be safe. So it's an investment not just for the rest of the world, it's for the U.S. itself. And that's how, I think, the administration sees this, and it's very important.

And the world is getting smaller and smaller. We are interdependent, intertwined. We are closer than anyone can imagine now, and at the same time to really move from one place to the other, the connections that we have is really bringing vulnerability, too. So that's why working together is the only option we have. So we're so connected, but at the same time we're so vulnerable also. So that's why we need to work together. And that's why WHO is saying national unity is important [but] don't politicize this virus, and global solidarity is important. When the two are in action — national unity and global solidarity — then the virus will not find cracks to exploit, because, you know, not only the technical expertise but the politics will also be healthy to drive the virus out.

In the year since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a pandemic, billions of lives around the world have been upended. Experts have warned of the mental health toll amid an increase in reports of anxiety, depression and distress.

“From the very beginning of the pandemic, those of us who worked in the field knew that there … would be a mental health crisis,” Dr Steven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of Pandemics, told Al Jazeera.

According to the WHO, before the pandemic hit, one billion people lived with a mental health issue. More than 264 million people worldwide were affected by depression, and suicide was the second-leading cause of death among young people.

During the pandemic, critical mental health services were halted in 93 percent of countries worldwide, according to the WHO, while demand for mental health support kept increasing.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the effect would last for “many years to come”, as “each and every individual on the surface of the world … has been affected”.

Ministry of loneliness

Prior to the outbreak, the WHO said social disconnection was already a serious public health crisis. With governments imposing tough restrictions on work and social life, often ordering people to stay at home and not mix with others, loneliness has been a defining feature of the COVID-19 pandemic for many.

In Japan, the government created a Ministry of Loneliness, an initiative that came after the country saw a spike in suicide rates last year. Last month, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said women, in particular, were struggling with loneliness and urged the new minister of loneliness to identify solutions.

According to preliminary numbers released by the National Police Agency, a total of 20,919 people took their lives in 2020, an increase of 750 from the previous year. Local media reported it was the first year-on-year increase in 11 years.

In the United Kingdom, in the middle of the pandemic, charities also reported an increase in cases of loneliness among the elderly.

According to research conducted in the UK by PLOS ONE in September 2020, 36 percent of the interviewed people reported feeling sometimes or often lonely during the pandemic.

“Individuals who don’t have a strong social support network to begin and may end up being isolated by the nature of the disease, are a vulnerable group,” Dr Joshua Klapow, a clinical psychologist, told Al Jazeera.

“They live alone and their family can’t visit them, they are at high risk as they can’t be supported either by their family or their friends or, religious organisations. And that isolation can lead to loneliness.

“When loneliness kicks in, we have feelings of hopelessness. We have feelings of helplessness that can lead typically to depression, or substance use.”

Feelings of depression, stress and anxiety

From the onset of the pandemic, health professionals highlighted the importance of monitoring rates of depression, stress and anxiety across vulnerable populations, including health workers.

According to a study conducted by Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, released in March, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 was 24 percent and 21.3 percent respectively.

The same report showed that prior to the pandemic in Asian countries, the estimate of depression prevalence ranged from 1.3 to 3.4 percent. Rates of anxiety in Asia prior to COVID-19 ranged from 2.1 percent to 4.1 percent, while in Europe estimates of anxiety prevalence prior to COVID were between 3 percent and 7.4 percent.

In China, a recent study showed 34.1 percent of people subjected to quarantine during the outbreak in early 2020 reported feeling at least one psychological symptom.

In the US about four in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder during the pandemic, compared with up to one in 10 adults who reported the same symptoms from January to June 2019.

In the UK, by the middle of 2020, almost one in five adults experienced some form of depression, this almost doubled from about one in 10 before the pandemic, according to the most recent data released by the Office for National Statistics.

“[During this health crisis] you can’t separate the measures from the [symptoms] that we witnessed,” Dr Jose Ayuso-Mateos, Director of WHO’s Collaborative Center for Mental Health Services Research & Chairman at Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, told Al Jazeera.

“And in that regard, the most affected ones were the young people, the people that lived alone, those who have a previous health condition, those who have had a medical history, and front-line health workers,” he added.

Dr Ayuso-Mateos said emergency mental health cases among young people increased in Madrid.

“We had to open new beds and space for the young people, this was something we didn’t expect,” he said. “We saw an increment in the suicide attempts within the adolescent population.”





Dr Klapow stressed that experiences of the “new normal” have been wildly different.

“We tend to think that the impact on people as being kind of the same, but there is great variation,” he said.

“For some people, they were relatively OK, because their lives were not heavily disrupted … but we [also] saw people that became isolated … or people whose life was turned upside down because a loved one was ill, or their social circles disappeared.”

“The more disruption, the more potential psychological damage,” he added.

Front-line health workers

Front-line healthcare workers were a highly vulnerable group as they were at a higher risk of not only being infected with the virus but also faced a high workload during the pandemic and in the early weeks lacked protective materials.

According to a recent review published in PLOS One, more than one in five front-line health workers experienced anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders during the pandemic.

Across 65 studies involving 97,333 health workers, researchers found a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. On a regional level, estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle East.

“When we talk about healthcare professionals, we see that they’re pushing their psychological resources to the absolute limit,” Dr Klapow said.

“They’re very often in hopeless situations, where they can’t do what they’ve been trained to do. They can’t help people, or they’re watching people die.”

“We can see anxiety disorders, depression and alcoholism or substance use,” he added.

China, where mental illnesses have long been stigmatised, has been praised for its efforts to tackle the mental health consequences of the pandemic.

In January 2020, the National Health Commission of China shared principles to deal with the emergency psychological crisis, and mental health hotlines were enabled across the country to offer counselling and psychological services.

Dr Taylor cited an example in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, where mental health workers set up a nightly programme about mental health issues.

“There was a self-help line where people could phone up and get advice .. and if they couldn’t solve the problems during the self-help consult, they got referred to Zoom meetings with mental health practitioners,” he said.

Despite the quick reaction of Chinese authorities, according to nationwide surveys, anxiety, and depression were prevalent among the country’s general population. But according to the Columbia study, China had the lowest prevalence of both disorders compared with other countries.





Can the world bounce back?

The WHO has warned the pandemic could generate mass trauma on a larger scale than World War II.

“After the second world war, the world has experienced mass trauma because the Second World War affected many lives. And now, even with this COVID pandemic, with bigger magnitude, more lives have been affected,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in March.

“And that means mass trauma, which is beyond proportion,” he added.

However, some experts believe many people will be able to “bounce back”.

“If you go back to 1919, during the Spanish flu, there was the pandemic, there was also encephalitis lethargica pandemic at the same time, the so-called sleeping sickness, there were childhood diseases, there was World War I happening, people died by the age of 60 … it was grim, and one year after all of that in 1920 people bounced back,” Dr Taylor explained.

“In 1919, everyone is wearing masks, and in 1920 no one is wearing masks. In Wuhan in August 2020, when they were released from the lockdown [people] just flopped out to parties.”

However, Dr Taylor noted there will still be a mental health toll, with many people requiring mental health resources.

“[This will happen] for the people that, for example, developed COVID-19, developed PTSD, developed long COVID-19, they are the people who will experience the deep trauma,” he said.

“There might also be lingering economic hardships for people … the economic consequence, and they will take longer to recover from it.

“But for a lot of other people, they will just bounce back, and they will want to forget COVID-19.”"

Isolation, joblessness, childcare, and many other challenges severely affected the mental well-being of many people around the world. Yet here we are, a year on. How are we coping? Share on Pinterest Design by Diego Sabogal The physical health effects of COVID-19 and the countless deaths the pandemic has claimed have been, and continue to be, devastating on a global scale. However, the mental health of people across the globe also took a hit. Last year, dozens of Medical News Today readers spoke to us about the stress and anxiety that came with the first waves of lockdown. People were worried about the emotional impact that the loss of loved ones would have on themselves and on their friends and neighbors. Many found it hard to cope with the grief and isolation, and others found it hard to deal with job loss and financial insecurity. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. Throughout the pandemic, MNT have also reported on the unique mental health challenges faced by people of color, Indigenous communities, undocumented migrants, and many others whose baseline of what constitutes mental wellness was already lower than that of the general population. Frontline healthcare workers and others in the caregiving industry faced similar emotional challenges.

Where we were a year ago The pandemic has forced some people to work and expose themselves to the virus, while others have benefited from working from home. At the start of the pandemic, some people enjoyed more relaxed lockdown measures (depending on which country they were in), while others felt safer through strict self-isolation. Still, overall, the mental effects of lockdown did not fail to appear: People reported feeling more agitated, more stressed, more restless, and more sleepless. Studies confirmed this. A small but worrying survey from March 2020 revealed increased alcohol and cannabis use among people in the United States. They likely turned to these substances in an attempt to relieve their pandemic-induced anxiety and depression. The same survey found that a whopping 38% of people were feeling tired or lacked energy, 36% were having sleep disturbances, and 25% were feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. Around 24% of respondents also reported having difficulty concentrating, 43% felt nervous, anxious, or on edge, 36% reported not being able to stop worrying, and 35% said that they were finding it hard to relax. In the United Kingdom, other studies with larger population samples found similar results. Of the participants, 25% said that their anxiety and depression during lockdown got significantly worse, and 37.5% met clinical criteria for generalized anxiety, depression, or health anxiety at the time (April 2020). A year ago, however, there was also hope. Hope that, on a mental health level, the pandemic would allow us to slow down, be more mindful, and have more time to reflect. MNT readers reported finding new working from home arrangements, for those lucky enough to have them, less stressful and more creativity-inducing. Working at a more “human pace,” said one reader, would hopefully enable them to work in more creative and environmentally friendly ways. So, a year on, have any of these hopes materialized? Has the pandemic had any benefits for our well-being, or are we all worse off across the board? How have our mental health and well-being evolved and changed compared with this time last year? To find out, we spoke to our readers and, as usual, examined some of the available research. 1 year of COVID-19: Video summary

Where are we now? Scientists are using huge datasets to track the impact that pandemic control measures have had on people’s mental health. Although the full picture has yet to become clear, we can discern its early contours — and the overall first impression is looking rather bleak. Scientists are starting to see a global “surge” in depression. According to a December 2020 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, 42% of people in the country reported symptoms of anxiety or depression that month. This was a huge increase from the 11% they recorded in 2019. Another study that MNT reported on found that cases of depression in the U.S. had tripled over the course of the pandemic. The picture looks similar worldwide. One recently published Nature article notes an increase of 9% in depression rates in June 2020, compared with pre-pandemic times, among U.K. adults. Another study that looked at residents in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada found a 14% increase in anxiety as a result of the pandemic. An important thing to note is that the pandemic seems to have affected older adults’ mental health less severely, compared with that of younger adults. Here, the impact may have been buffered by the key element of resilience, though it is also worth mentioning that white older adults fared better than older adults from historically marginalized groups. Many, though not all, MNT readers confirmed that, from a mental health perspective, things have indeed worsened rather than improved since the early days of the pandemic. When explicitly asked if things had gotten better or worse, one MNT reader said: “At this stage, worse. While I’m hopeful about the vaccine bringing positive change, the way people have decided that the virus is no longer an issue is a cause of stress. Add in the other challenges that have arisen over the [past] year, and the stress is amplified.” “Much worse,” said another reader. “I’d say my mental health has slowly declined over the past year.” Yet another contributor categorically said, “I am feeling much worse a year on, hands down.” Interestingly, some MNT readers pointed out that resilience is not necessarily protecting them from the adverse mental health effects of the pandemic. Even though they feel stronger, that does not make them feel emotionally better. One reader said, “I feel I’ve become stronger mentally but have had to overcome stress and loneliness in a way I never would have imagined. [I feel] stronger, but certainly more weary! I’d say [my mental state is] worse overall.” Another reader mentioned similar feelings, adding: “The one positive that I can acknowledge 1 year on is that I have a newfound respect for myself and more confidence in my own abilities: I have made it on my own through a very isolating, difficult, anxiety-inducing time, and I remind myself of my own strength every day.” Others reported feelings of emptiness and indifference at this stage. “I mostly feel sort of numb,” one reader said. “I feel like I go through each day on autopilot,” they added. Another reader noted that they feel “removed” from other people. Many MNT readers echo feelings that surveys documented at the start of the pandemic and report that these feelings have amplified. They note a lack of concentration, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, and unhealthy eating habits. “I’m exhausted all the time. It’s an emotional exhaustion. That being said, falling asleep is a challenge most nights because it’s the first time in the day when nobody is there, expecting things from me, and my brain begins focusing on every problem, question, or concern I pushed to the side in order to make it through a workday and parenting the children.” “I have been having sleeping issues,” another reader noted. “I have some nights where I just lie awake, which I rarely had before. Other times, I wake after a long sleep but still feel exhausted, despite not doing much during the week.” Many readers mentioned a lack of restorative sleep. “I don’t sleep less, but my sleep is of poorer quality, and I often don’t feel restored in the mornings,” said one reader. Researchers have expressed worry that some of these adverse mental health effects may linger after we come out of the pandemic. “I don’t think this is going to go back to baseline anytime soon,” clinical psychologist Luana Marques — from Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA — told Nature . Of course, for some people, the baseline was already quite low. This makes things more worrying for them. “I have experienced exceedingly high levels of anxiety. Older concerns I used to have have come back and seem more overwhelming than ever,” one reader told MNT. Another reader said: “I’ve always been a relatively anxious kind of person, but that aspect of my personality has really come to the fore. I am constantly on edge. I no longer find joy in the things I used to love, and my go-to emotion is panic.”

Loneliness, isolation, and other causes of anxiety This surge in depression and anxiety, while worrying, is not surprising given the numerous challenges the pandemic has posed to so many of us. People who reached out to MNT spoke about recurrent feelings of anxiety, depression, panic, loneliness, and isolation. “I have retreated into myself over the past year and found myself reaching out less and less to friends, as if I’ve become used to living life alone,” one reader said. Readers mentioned several reasons for their anxieties, including fear for one’s health and the health of a loved one, loss of income, being alone, and having too many parental responsibilities, to name only a few. “As a single person who lives alone and did not have access to a support bubble, I have become increasingly isolated,” said one reader. “And since my family lives in a different country, the fact that I was unable to see them in person for an entire year, and that I was unable to support them effectively through times of illness and grief, have really left a mark and made the pandemic more difficult to cope with.” Another reader said, “The lack of two incomes, the addition of other changes to work and health, and the spotty application of safety measures (at least here in Florida, [U.S.]) have taken a toll. I feel like I’ve hit my absolute limit, and the stress is weighing heavily on every day.” Although many people are stressed because of a lack of work, many others feel overworked. “My deepening sense of isolation has contributed to feelings of helplessness and anxiety,” said one reader. “The fact that I work from home means that I end up working longer hours. Work itself has become more stressful and intense, which makes me teeter on the edge of burnout almost constantly.”

‘The changes have come in waves’ Humans, in general — and those who are more scientifically minded, in particular — have a tendency to seek clearly understandable patterns, search for neat trends, and wrap up reality with a scientific bow. However, reality is often messier than this. Much like the stages of grief that rarely occur in a neat order, a clear upward or downward trend in mental wellness throughout lockdown is also difficult to trace. Many MNT readers said that the changes to their mental health have come in “waves” or “cycles.” “The changes have come in waves,” said one reader. “At the beginning, the uncertainty and the worries about health were overwhelming, and it was a hit to my mental health.” “Once changes were made, masks mandated, and our family found a new routine, it was actually a time of positive change. My family spent more time together, daily worries like getting places on time and rushed meals turned to relaxed time spent walking the neighborhood and playing board games after dinner.” “[My mental state] fluctuated between an odd relaxed state at the beginning, to despondency at the state of the world, to a current state of awareness (yet again) of the need to do things now, while still making plans for the future,” said another reader. Some researchers echo this sentiment, and some studies support this notion. For example, Richard Bentall — a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. — notes that while the effects of the lockdown may have appeared devastating in the short term and in the early stages of the pandemic, when we zoom out, “a different picture emerges.” Prof. Bentall’s research suggests “an overall reduction in the number of people who report ‘above-threshold’ levels of psychiatric symptoms, and similar findings have been reported by other research groups .” That is not to say that things are better overall, he notes. Instead, he points out that there are “different slopes for different folks,” meaning that different populations start out from different positions with regards to their mental health and that the emerging, overall narrative is likely to be multifaceted."

A year into the coronavirus pandemic, the enormous changes in our lives have become unremarkable: The collection of fabric masks. Visits with friends or family only in small outdoor gatherings. Working or learning from home. Downtowns deserted at noon on a weekday.

While some changes happened gradually, there was one day that marked the beginning of the new normal.

March 11, 2020.

On that day in the United States, the pandemic future arrived all at once.

A historic day begins with other news

March 11 was a Wednesday. Joe Biden had won primaries the night before in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri, putting him on a path toward clinching the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders said he was staying in the race, despite his disappointing results.

The big news in the morning — and what was expected to be the top headline of the day — was the sentencing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Sitting in a Manhattan courtroom, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual abuse.

Two days earlier, stocks had tumbled in reaction to Saudi Arabia cutting the price of oil, spurring the market's worst drop since 2008.

And the coronavirus — which had already sparked lockdowns in China and Italy — had become a major concern in the U.S. The first case in the U.S. was announced on Jan. 21 in Everett, Wash. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.

Some schools in the U.S. had already closed, affecting about 850,000 students. And some Americans were trying to figure out whether to cancel the expensive cruises they had booked — days earlier, the State Department had put out a warning against such travel, following outbreaks on several ships.

The CDC had issued guidance on getting tested for the virus, but it was hard to figure out where such tests might be available. And there were — as there continue to be – instances of racism and xenophobia targeting Asian Americans as fears of the virus spread through the U.S.

Dr. Fauci testifies: ""It's going to get worse""

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been called to testify about the coronavirus on March 11 before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

Observers in the chamber sat shoulder to shoulder, and there was not a mask in sight.

""Is the worst yet to come, Dr. Fauci?"" asked Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the committee chairwoman.

""Yes, it is,"" Fauci replied. He explained that the U.S. was seeing more cases from both community spread and international travel.

""I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,"" Fauci said. ""How much worse we'll get will depend on our ability to do two things: to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside, and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country.""

The virus had by then infected more than 1,000 people in 40 states. At least 31 people in the U.S. had died from COVID-19, most of them in Washington state.

""Bottom line,"" Fauci said, ""it's going to get worse.""

WHO declares a pandemic — and stocks plunge

In Geneva, the WHO was holding a briefing. Eight countries, including the U.S., now had more than 1,000 cases.

""In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" he said.

""We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.""

The global health emergency was now officially a pandemic — the first one to be caused by a coronavirus.

The stock market reacted quickly to the new designation: the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,200 points.

By the end of the day, the Dow was down more than 20% from its peak in February – and had entered bear market territory. An 11-year bull market had come to an end.

In prime-time Oval Office address, Trump bans travel from Europe

At 3:18 p.m., with the pandemic now official and stocks cratering, President Donald Trump sent out a tweet: ""I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!"" He said he would address the nation from the Oval Office that evening.

At 9:02 p.m., Trump began his remarks: ""My fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.""

""This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,"" he continued. ""I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus,"" he said.

Then he made a stunning announcement: a 30-day ban on travel from European countries to the U.S., beginning on Friday at midnight — just two days later — ""to keep new cases from entering our shores.""

Trump White House Archived YouTube

Experts were skeptical the ban would make much of a difference. ""It may have political value, but [it] has zero public health value,"" Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, told NPR.

""Most of Europe has the same or fewer cases than the U.S. Restricting travel certainly won't make America safer,"" Gostin said.

Confusion followed the speech, about who and what would be affected by the ban. Trump soon tweeted a clarification: ""trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.""

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson test positive for the virus

Shortly after 9 p.m. ET, Tom Hanks posted a photo to Instagram of a surgical glove in a trash can, along with an announcement: He and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, were sick with the coronavirus.

""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too,"" he wrote. The two were in Australia for preproduction on a film starring Hanks.

""Well, now. What to do next?"" Hanks continued. ""The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

An NBA game is halted just before tipoff

In Oklahoma City, the Thunder were about to take on the visiting Utah Jazz. Around 8 p.m. ET, shortly before tipoff, the referees and coaches conferred about an unsettling development: Jazz center Rudy Gobert's coronavirus test had just come back —positive.

The teams returned to their locker rooms. The halftime act, Frankie J, was brought out to perform for the packed arena, where fans were stirring in confusion. ""Wild times,"" said an ESPN commentator on the game's broadcast. ""The fans here in the arena don't know what's going on, we don't know what's going on.""

A moment later, the public address announcer took to the microphone. ""The game tonight has been postponed. You are all safe,"" he said. Cries of dismay rang out from the stands. ""Take your time in leaving the arena tonight, and do so in an orderly fashion.""

The Jazz tested the rest of its players and traveling party and found that a second player, Donovan Mitchell, was also positive for the virus.

ESPN YouTube

Word soon got out of even bigger news: The NBA would be postponing its entire season. In Dallas, ESPN trained a camera on Mavericks owner Mark Cuban as he got the news on his phone.

He reacted in shock: His jaw dropped, and he leaned way back in his chair. ""Now it's much more personal. You've seen what's happening in other countries,"" he told a reporter a few minutes later. ""But just the whole idea that it's come this close, potentially a couple players have it ... just stunning isn't the right word. It's crazy.""

The players on the Mavericks bench were aware of the news and talking about it, Cuban said — the only ones who didn't know were the players still in the game.

At 9:46 p.m., the NBA made it official: The season was suspended until further notice.

""This is much bigger than just the NBA,"" Cuban told the reporter.

""Do we send our kids to school tomorrow? Is it that big?"" he mused. ""It's like out of a movie. It doesn't seem real."""

Major changes are needed to reverse the profound social, educational and economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, concludes a landmark review.

The review by the British Academy, published on the anniversary of the UK’s first lockdown, predicts that the pandemic will cause a decade-long shadow amidst declining public trust, worsening mental health and widening social inequalities.

Bringing together more than 500 pieces of evidence, the review identified nine key areas of social impact that need investment to mitigate the damage caused by the virus.

“The impact of covid-19 is not coming to an end. The social, economic and cultural impacts of the pandemic will cast a long shadow,” said Molly Morgan Jones of the British Academy at a press conference on Monday.

The review found that the UK’s successful covid-19 vaccine roll-out has failed to restore trust in the government, leaving high levels of distrust that experts warn will undermine efforts to change public behaviour.

Distrust in the UK government climbed last December and until early March has hovered at 61 per cent, with trust at 21 per cent, the review found. The numbers mark a sharp reversal from the early stages of the pandemic: in May 2020 slightly more people trusted than distrusted the government.

“Distrust in national government remains relatively high. I don’t think the roll-out is being attributed to government competence, it’s being attributed to the [National Health Service] and local delivery systems,” says Dominic Abrams at the University of Kent, UK.

Distrust is a major challenge because it “undermines the ability to mobilise public behaviour for wider social and health benefits”, according to the review, which was commissioned by Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser.

The wide-ranging review explores the social effects covid-19 will have for many years to come after the epidemic is brought under control. Young people are expected to be disproportionately hard hit in coming years, with the review concluding it is “unfeasible” for the lost education from months of school closures to be wholly recovered.

Richard Blundell at University College London says extra tutoring and learning for young people will need to be “long term” and “permanently in place”. That will require getting broadband and hardware to everyone who needs it, he adds.

While young people have had far fewer physical health impacts from the pandemic, the mental well-being of those aged between 16 and 24 deteriorated more than any other age group during the first lockdown, the review says.

It also found that the pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities along gender, ethnic and income lines. “Covid revealed shocking inequalities that had been there all along,” said Morgan Jones.

Investment to narrow the digital divide and reimagine urban spaces are among the solutions proposed by the British Academy in a second report, also published today.

Getty Images Sixty-one percent of U.S. adults report undesired weight changes since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Stress, lack of exercise, unhealthy changes in eating habits, and increased alcohol consumption are all contributing factors.

Experts say making small adjustments to your daily routine can help make big changes for a more healthy lifestyle. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from the serious health concerns associated with COVID-19, you may have heard people make light about gaining “the COVID 19.” This is a play on the “freshman 15” reference of gaining weight during the first year of college. But as much as it’s become a joke to some, it’s rooted in reality. With the closing of gyms, the complete disruption of our daily lives, and the increase of daily stress, many people have gained weight since the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, a new American Psychological Association (APA) survey of more than 3,000 people reveals that 61 percent of U.S. adults report undesired weight changes since the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), before the pandemic, about 40 percent of people had obesity in the United States. According to the new APA survey, 2 in 5 of the 3,000 adults surveyed gained more weight than they intended over the last year, at an average of 29 pounds per person. Ten percent said they gained more than 50 pounds. Weight changes are a common symptom of coping with mental health challenges, according to the APA.

Why do we gain weight during times of emotional struggle? “In times of stress, we often engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms, for example, overeating,” said Brittany LeMonda, PhD, senior neuropsychologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “Many people are ’emotional eaters’ and eat comfort food in the context of negative emotions.” Both experts Healthline spoke with said it’s not surprising that people engaged in emotional eating, given that the pandemic has been ongoing for more than a year. It’s been an emotionally charged time for practically everyone. This, coupled with the closing of gyms and offices as well as physical distancing orders, gives clear impetus for gaining weight. “I think a lot of people working from home didn’t have as much free time as they anticipated. They weren’t getting the commute walking that they used to. Without the structure of the day, they weren’t going to the gym on the way home — and the gyms were closed anyway,” said Dr. Michael Ford, internist and primary care physician with New York-Presbyterian Medical Group Hudson Valley. Another contributing factor to weight gain during the pandemic is an increased amount of alcohol consumption. A December 2020 study showed that 60 percent of U.S. adults reported an increase in drinking alcohol due to the pandemic. “I can’t tell you how many patients told me that they were drinking cocktails every night, which are full of calories,” Ford said. “When everything shut down, many of us looked at it like apocalyptic survival mode. But then [the pandemic] stretched on for months, and we developed bad habits. The weight packed on.” Ford said that anxiety can often be the cause for an increase in drinking. He also pointed out the number of prescriptions for anxiety medications has also increased during the pandemic. Many anti-anxiety medications have weight gain as a side effect."

In a hard-hitting review released today, Auditor General Karen Hogan took the country's primary pandemic response agency to task for failures in early warning, surveillance, risk assessments, data-sharing with the provinces and follow-up on Canadian travellers who were ordered into quarantine.

""The agency was not adequately prepared to respond to the pandemic, and it underestimated the potential impact of the virus at the onset of the pandemic,"" said the AG's review — one of three that looked at the Liberal government's management of the COVID-19 crisis, which as of Thursday had killed 22,780 Canadians and brought the country's economy to its knees.

The auditor also reviewed federal COVID emergency benefit programs such as the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) and the Canada emergency wage subsidy (CEWS) to determine whether the benefits reached people in need and whether the government imposed enough controls to limit abuse.

Her most critical comments, however, were reserved for the topic of pandemic preparedness. Hogan said PHAC, which was established to ensure the country was ready for a major outbreak, ""was not as well prepared as it could have been"" because major contingency plans and issues related to surveillance had not been resolved or dealt with — even though some of them had been pointed out by previous auditors.

""I am discouraged that the Public Health Agency of Canada did not address long-standing issues, some of which were raised repeatedly for more than two decades,"" Hogan said.

""These issues negatively affected the sharing of health surveillance data between the Agency and the provinces and territories.""

'Much more work to do'

While the agency took steps to address some of these problems during the pandemic, she said, ""it has much more work to do on its data sharing agreements and information technology infrastructure to better support national disease surveillance in the future.""

The report found that the agency's Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), a surveillance system that scours the internet for reports of infectious disease outbreaks in other countries, did not issue an alert to provide an early warning when COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, China.

The network, which is part of PHAC, did email a daily report to domestic subscribers, including the provinces, with links to related news articles.

Officials at the public health agency defended the low-key approach by saying that at the end of December 2019, other international sources had already shared news of the virus, making it unnecessary to issue an alert.

The auditor also criticized the risk assessments the agency put together after COVID-19 began spreading around the globe — reports which key leaders used to make decisions on public health measures such as closing the border. She said those assessments were oblivious to the unfolding global crisis.

Failed to appreciate threat

""The agency assessed that COVID‐19 would have a minimal impact if an outbreak were to occur in Canada,"" said the audit.

In fact, right up to the point when the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global pandemic — on March 11, 2020 — those risk assessments continued to rate the threat to the country as ""low.""

It wasn't until the day after — in response to escalating case counts in Canada and rising concerns among provincial governments — that Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam ordered an upgrade to the risk rating, the review said.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu defended the decisions during question period on Thursday, pointing to a separate internal evaluation by her department which said the changes made to GPHIN did not impact the federal government's response to the crisis.

Nevertheless, she accepted the auditor general's criticism.

""We have reviewed the auditor general's report, we agree that this country, along with all countries, will need to review our response to the pandemic and make investments in public health, as we have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Hajdu, who also pledged to hire more public health staff and insisted that gaps are being plugged with $690 million in new funds.

Speaking prior to the release of the report, Dr. Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer, said the audit offers a snapshot of a particular moment in the pandemic's trajectory and the agency has worked hard to address the problems.

""Certainly, this pandemic is unprecedented,"" said Njoo. ""We haven't had a pandemic like this ... in at least over 100 years.""

A lot of countries around the world are learning lessons, he said, and ""I think we're all learning from each other ...""

Drawing a blank on the border

The audit also found out that PHAC and the Canada Border Services Agency did not know whether two-thirds of incoming travellers followed quarantine orders.

""The agency referred few of the travellers for in‐person follow‐up to verify compliance with orders,"" said the review.

Part of that problem could be due to the limits of public health information.

""Of the individuals considered to be at risk of non‐compliance, the agency referred only 40 per cent to law enforcement and did not know whether law enforcement actually contacted them,"" said the audit.

The auditor said PHAC also fell down on data sharing. The public health agency did have an agreement with the provinces and territories to share data, but it was not fully implemented when the pandemic hit.

The auditor general also said the federal government didn't do enough to ensure the ""integrity"" of the Canada emergency wage subsidy program (CEWS).

'Integrity' of CEWS program 'at risk'

CEWS was launched in March 2020 to subsidize up to 75 per cent of wages for workers who were kept on their employers' payrolls.

To get the program out the door as quickly as possible, the CRA was only able to conduct limited tests before approving payments, said the audit.

""Without effective controls for validating payments, the integrity of the program is at risk and ineligible employers might receive the subsidy,"" the audit concluded.

It also said the agency did not have up‑to‑date earnings and tax data for assessing applicants. For example, 28 per of applicants did not file a GST/HST return for the 2019 calendar year.

""We noted that the subsidy was paid to applicants despite their history of penalties for failure to remit and other advance indicators of potential insolvency,"" said the audit. ""Indeed, the agency held no legislative authority to deny access to the subsidy on the basis of an employer's history of non‑compliance with tax obligations."""

The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the mental health of teenagers in the United States, according to an analysis of medical records and insurance claims conducted by nonprofit FAIR Health, which found that overdoses, intentional self-harm claims, substance use disorders and claims for depression and anxiety disorders all increased substantially in 2020 compared to the prior year.

Insurance claims related to overdoses among teenagers jumped up 119% in April 2020 versus April ... [+] 2019, while claim reports for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorders rose 94% and 84%, respectively. getty

Key Facts

Fair Health analyzed data from over 32 billion private healthcare claim records, tracking month-by-month changes from January to November 2020 compared to the same timeframe in 2019. The most significant spikes were discovered early on in the pandemic, as the overall number of insurance claims for mental health issues among young people ages 13 to 18 in March and April of 2020, as a percentage of all medical claim procedures, was nearly double compared to the prior year. Specifically, claims related to overdoses among that age group jumped up 119% in April 2020 versus April 2019, while claim reports for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorders rose 94% and 84%, respectively. Claims for intentional self-harm as a percentage of all medical claim rpeorts in the 13 to 18 age group increased 99.8% during that time frame. According to the study, these claims remained elevated through November.

Crucial Quote:

“We know that teenagers already have high rates of mental illness,” Dr. Jess Shatkin of the Child Study Center at NYU Langone Medical Center told MedPage Today. “Now [with the pandemic]

Key Background:

While confirmed cases of Covid-19 and related fatalities can clearly be tracked, the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of human beings is not as easily quantifiable. The Fair Health study's authors cite infection-related fears, grief, economic instability and social isolation as contributing factors that have triggered and intensified mental health issues. The numbers in the study align with previously reported data on this subject. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released last summer found that the prevalence of depression in June 2020 was approximately four times higher than in the second quarter of 2019, with anxiety about three times higher as well. Several other studies have also shown that young people have been particularly vulnerable to mental health issues due in large part to school closures, which have left them isolated from friends and teachers.

What To Watch For:

The debate related to reopening schools continues to rage on in many parts of the country, as millions of children still rely solely on remote learning. While running for President, Joe Biden pledged to reopen schools for in-person instruction within his first 100 days in office. However, there has been confusion regarding how and when each closed district will direct students to return to the classroom.

Chief Critic:

“The Biden Administration has consistently undermined their own CDC by revising science-based guidelines to conform to union insiders’ demands,” said Gov. Larry Hogan (R-Md.). “I believe President Biden is genuine in his stated goal of wanting kids back in school, but it often appears his administration is working against him.”

Big Number:

333%. Comparing August 2019 to August 2020 in the Northeast section of the U.S., for the age group 13 to 18, there was a 333.9% increase in intentional self-harm claim reports as a percentage of all medical claims, which marked the highest rate in any region in any month of 2020, according to the Fair Health study.

Esther Montanez’s housecleaning job at the Hilton Back Bay in Boston was a lifeline for her, a 31-year-old single mother with a 5-year-old son.

The pay was steady and solid — enough to pay her bills and still have money left over to sock away for a savings account for her child. Montanez liked her co-workers and felt pride in her work.

But when the viral pandemic slammed violently into the U.S. economy a year ago, igniting a devastating recession, it swept away her job, along with many tens of millions of others. Since then, in desperation, Montanez has siphoned away money from her son’s savings to help meet expenses. At Christmas, she turned to charities to provide presents for him. For now, she’s getting by on unemployment aid and, for the first time, has applied for food stamps.

“The truth is, I want my job back,” said Montanez, who has banded with her former colleagues and worked through their union to press the hotel to reinstate their jobs.

Getting it back could prove a struggle for her, along with millions of other unemployed people around the world. Even as viral vaccines increasingly promise a return to something close to normal life, the coronavirus seems sure to leave permanent scars on the job market. At least 30% of the U.S. jobs lost to the pandemic aren’t expected to come back — a sizable proportion of them at employers that require face-to-face contact with consumers: Hotels, restaurants, retailers, entertainment venues. United Here, Montanez’s union, says 75% of the 300,000 hospitality workers it represents remain out of work.

The threat to workers in those occupations, many of them low-wage earners, marks a sharp reversal from the 2008-2009 Great Recession, when middle- and higher-wage construction, factory, office and financial services workers bore the brunt of job losses.

No one knows exactly what the job market will look like when the virus finally ends its rampage.

Will consumers feel confident enough to return in significant numbers to restaurants, bars, movie theaters and shops, allowing those decimated businesses to employ as many people as they did before?

How much will white-collar professionals continue to work from home, leaving downtown business districts all but empty during the week?

Will business travel fully rebound now that companies have seen the ease with which co-workers can collaborate on video platforms at far less cost?

“Jobs are changing — industries are changing,” said Loretta Penn, chair of the Virginia Ready Initiative, which helps workers develop new skills and find new jobs. “We’re creating a new normal every day.’’

The habits that people have grown accustomed to in the pandemic — working, shopping, eating and enjoying entertainment from home — could prove permanent for many. Though these trends predated the virus, the pandemic accelerated them. Depending on how widely such habits stick, demand for waiters, cashiers, front-desk clerks and ticket takers may never regain its previous highs.

The consultancy McKinsey & Co. estimates that the United States will lose 4.3 million jobs in customer and food service in the next decade.

In a study, José María Barrero of Mexico’s ITAM Business School, Nick Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago concluded that 32% to 42% of COVID-induced layoffs will be permanent.

The U.S. Labor Department, too, has tried to estimate the pandemic’s likely impact on the job market. Before taking the pandemic into account, the department last year projected that U.S. jobs would grow 3.7% between 2019 and 2029.

Last month, it estimated that if the outbreak’s lasting economic effects were limited mainly to increased work from home, job growth over the 10 years would slow to 2.9%.

But if the pandemic exerts a deeper, longer-lasting impact — with many consumers going less frequently to restaurants, movie theaters and shopping centers — job growth would slow to just 1.9%, the department predicted. In that worst-case scenario, the department estimated, employment would tumble 13% for waiters and waitresses, 14% for bartenders, 16% for fast food cooks and 22% for hotel desk clerks.

The coronavirus recession has been especially cruel, victimizing people at the bottom of the pay scale. Lael Brainard, one of the Federal Reserve’s governors, said last month that the poorest 25% of American workers were facing “Depression-era rates of unemployment of around 23%” in mid-January — nearly quadruple the national jobless rate.

The Fed also reported last month that employment in the lowest-paid jobs was running 20% below pre-pandemic levels. For the highest-paying jobs, by contrast, the shortfall was just 5%.

Services workers had long been thought to be safe from the threats that menaced factory employment: Foreign competition and automation. But more and more, as employers have sought to save money in a time of uncertainty and to promote social distancing in the workplace, machines are reaching beyond the factory floor and into retail, restaurants and hotels.

Tamura Jamison, for instance, came back to a changed job when she was recalled to work in June as a front desk agent at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, owned by Caesars Entertainment. Her hours were cut from 40 to about 32 a week, resulting in a pay cut of about $700 a month.

Just 26 of 45 workers on her team were brought back. Existing self-service kiosks used to be optional for guests checking in. No longer. Now, agents must direct guests to the kiosks and intervene only if needed. That means fewer commissions for room upgrades; guests can request them on their own.

As a union shop steward, Jamison knows that her missing colleagues won’t likely be recalled.

“At this point,” she said, “they have to move on with their lives.”

Jamison wonders whether the front desk operation will eventually be eliminated altogether, the jobs lost to automation. Guests, she notes, will soon have keys on their smartphones, allowing them to go directly to their rooms.

“This is the start of a new Vegas,” Jamison said. “The front desk doesn’t really have to be there. There are ways to eliminate our jobs.”

In a study out last month, Stefania Albanesi of the University of Pittsburgh and Jiyeon Kim of the Korea Development Institute warned that in a world still fearful of the virus or of other health threats, many companies could replace employees with machines rather than redesign workspaces to facilitate social distancing and reduce the threat of infection.

The services occupations that have absorbed the biggest job losses, they say, “have high susceptibility to automation.” That “raises the prospect that as the economy recovers, at least some of the jobs lost may not be reinstated.’’

Few places have been hurt more ruinously by the pandemic than Las Vegas, whose economy is powered by out-of-town visitors and live entertainment. Until 12 months ago, Sharon Beza was among 283,000 workers in the city’s tourism and hospitality field. She had worked as a cocktail waitress at Eastside Cannery hotel-casino from the time it opened in 2008 to the day she was furloughed a year ago. Over the summer, her job was eliminated.

Now a part-time cashier at an Albertsons grocery store, Beza is still seeking full-time work in the restaurant industry, which employed her for 37 years. She’s holding out hope that Las Vegas will rebound and tourists will return to restaurants, hotels and casinos. But it may be impossible, she knows, for laid-off workers like her to land jobs that offer the kinds of solid wages, tips and benefits they used to enjoy.

In Europe, government jobs programs have prevented a devastating spike in unemployment. Unemployment in January was 8.1%, up only modestly from 7.4% a year earlier. Yet an economic reckoning has begun, with companies in the worst-hit sectors envisioning years of reduced demand.

Consider commercial airlines. Lufthansa’s workforce shrank from 138,000 to 110,000 in 2020. British Airways plans to cut 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. UK-based regional airline Flybe took 2,000 jobs with it when it collapsed a year ago.

Germany’s hotel and restaurant association says that despite government support to help maintain payrolls, employment sank from 2.45 million pre-pandemic to 2.09 million. Holger Schaefer, a labor economist at the German Economic Institute in Cologne, suggested that behavioral changes — more digital meetings, for example, and less business travel — would result in permanent job losses in some companies.

By contrast, some other sectors of the economy should benefit from pent-up demand once the virus is defeated. Schaefer is optimistic about restaurants, for one.

“There is a fundamental demand for such services,” he said. “I can’t imagine that when everyone is vaccinated and it’s safe, that there will still be problems in that area.”

Around the world in the Chinese city of Xuzhou, northwest of Shanghai, Guan Li, a convenience store owner, said he hired four out-of-work relatives but had to lay them off after sales fell by half. Now, he and his wife run the shop themselves.

“People just don’t want to buy,” he said. Guan, who is close to 60, and his wife plan to retire because the shop’s income may no longer cover their costs. Owners of two similar shops nearby also plan to close, he said.

In Egypt, Mohammed Gamal used to earn a decent living working six days a week at a café in Giza, twin city of Cairo. But pandemic restrictions and dwindling business shrank his workweek and slashed his income by more than half. It didn’t help when the government banned “sheesha,” the hookah water pipe that’s popular across the Middle East and is a major moneymaker for cafes.

In mid-2020, he sent his wife and two children back to his parents’ house in Beni Mazar, south of Cairo. Now, he shares a room with a friend to save on rent.

“I just work three days a week, and this is not enough even for a single person,” said Gamal, 31.

In Mexico City, Gerardo González, wearing a suit, a black mask and a plastic face shield, waited recently on the sidewalk outside the delivery service Didi. He had hoped to find work a month after he lost his job at a bakery where he did cleaning and displayed merchandise.

He’s applied for jobs at five companies.

“I can’t get anything,” said González, 51, who supports his wife and two young children. To meet his family’s expenses, he’s burned through his savings.

“We hope that with the vaccine, things will start going back to normal,” he said.

Melinda Harmon lost a job she loved as a bartender at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last year. First, she found work as a health care aide for $9.25 an hour. Even after receiving a raise to $10, she struggled to support her two sons. Frustrated, she resigned and took on a new job as a security guard for $12 an hour. She’s been switching off lights to save money for electricity and has had to delay haircuts for her two beloved Pomeranians.

Yet she remains optimistic that the Fiserv Forum will reopen and that she will one day be mixing drinks for Bucks fans again.

“I do believe things will go back,” said Harmon, 39.

In New York, Bill Zanker is also envisioning a comeback after being forced to close his luxury gym, Grit Bxng. He’s raising money to launch an at-home fitness business in the fall, which will mean eventually hiring to support a online business, including customer service and supply specialists.

Still, Zanker is hopeful that his Manhattan gym, known for its cocktail bar and backed by billionaire Tony Robbins and others, will eventually come roaring back. Before the pandemic forced its closure, Zanker said, classes would be booked for the entire week within two hours each Monday morning. With the bar typically packed, he had been on the verge of opening a second location.

“There is so much pent-up demand,” Zanker said. “People after class are going to want to hang out and socialize. It’s like after Prohibition: Party like there’s no tomorrow.”

However things shake out, the pandemic disruption to the job market will likely require millions of workers to find new careers. Reviewing the job outlook in eight major economies, McKinsey estimated that 100 million workers — 1 in 16 — will need to change occupations by 2030. In the United States, McKinsey concluded, workers who will need retraining are most likely to have a lost low-income job and to be Black, Hispanic or female.

“You can take people in these unskilled positions and teach them,” said Susan Lund, an author of the consultancy’s report on the jobs of the future. But in the United States, she said, “the problem is, we have not scaled it up. We do not a have a national program to do it.’’

The U.S. spends a fraction of what other rich countries do on programs that are designed to help workers make career transitions. And a bewildering web of employment and training programs often leaves workers confused. The programs tend to focus on helping laid-off factory workers — not the unemployed chefs and sales clerks who are likely to be most in need in the pandemic’s aftermath.

“We make people jump through insane hoops just to get advice on getting a new job,” said Annelies Goger, who studies training programs as a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “We make it extremely challenging.”

In a paper last year, David Autor and Elisabeth Reynolds of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warned that dwindling demand for low-paid workers without college degrees won’t coincide with job opportunities for “these same workers in middle-paid jobs...

“Those displaced may suffer significant hardship as they seek new work, potentially in occupations where they have no experience or training,” they wrote.

During past influenza pandemics, we have witnessed increased risks of morbidity and death in pregnant people and neonates.Early data suggest similar risks of acquisition of COVID-19 in pregnant and other healthy adults. However, studies exploring the indirect consequences of COVID-19 have found that pregnant individuals from Black, Asian, minority ethnic backgrounds, as well as from other disadvantaged groups, are more likely to be adversely affected by COVID-19.The effect of the pandemic on vulnerable populations needs to be compared not only with the non-vulnerable population, but also with the pre-pandemic status of those populations. The disparities related to resource levels, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, and caste among these vulnerable populations also need to be explored.

et al. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In The Lancet Global Health, Barbara Chmielewska and colleagues report a systematic review of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal outcomes.The authors included 40 studies that compared various maternal and neonatal health outcomes during and before the COVID-19 pandemic, from which outcomes that were reported in at least two studies were included in the meta-analysis (31 studies). They found significant increases in the incidence of stillbirth, maternal death, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and in mean maternal depression scores during the pandemic. Although the studies from high-income countries (HICs) showed a significant reduction in preterm births (before 37 weeks' gestation) during the pandemic, the same was not seen in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). There was significant heterogeneity in outcomes between HICs and LMICs, and the rates of the adverse outcomes were much higher in LMICs. These findings highlight disparities in health care within and across countries.

Choudhary R COVID-19 outbreak and decreased hospitalisation of pregnant women in labour. Most of the studies included in this review were single-centre studies and might not be a true representation of the community-level data. Studies from LMICs have shown an almost 50% reduction in hospitalisation and emergency visits during the pandemic, with increases in stillbirths and maternal deaths.These findings indicate that an increased number of unattended pregnancies might have resulted in greater rates of stillbirth, neonatal death, and maternal death. The increased risk of ruptured ectopic pregnancy further highlights the delay in seeking care in early pregnancy. Countries such as India imposed strict lockdown measures early in the pandemic, leading to restricted access to health-care facilities, whereas many countries deferred lockdowns until later. Redirection of resources and manpower for creating COVID-19 facilities led to compromises in essential non-COVID-19 services, thereby contributing to the adversities.Chmielewska and colleagues tried to address these factors through a regression analysis adjusting for the stringency of lockdown measures and WHO Healthcare Efficiency Index. They found that the immediate health-care response, rather than the stringent lockdown measures, was responsible for the heterogeneity in many outcomes. In resource-poor countries, even under normal circumstances, it is a challenge to provide adequate coverage for antenatal checkups, obstetric emergencies, universal institutional deliveries, and respectful maternity care. The COVID-19 pandemic has widened this gap and exposed several lacunae of health-care systems worldwide, but more so in LMICs.

et al. A systems approach to addressing COVID-19 health inequities. COVID-19 has had a severe negative impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3, as well as the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP).Before the pandemic, slow but steady progress was being made towards the goal of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 livebirths and ending preventable stillbirths (ten or fewer per 1000 total births) by 2035. However, COVID-19 has widened the equity gap in health care and set this progress back by a decade or so.Despite widespread concerns over the inequalities in COVID-19-related mortality and morbidities among racial and ethnic minorities and socially disadvantaged groups, little attention has been paid to systematic solutions at the global level.To address these disparities, we must acknowledge the vulnerability of pregnant individuals to COVID-19, especially in LMICs, and take immediate steps to quantify the damage. Data on maternal mortality, the mental health status of pregnant people, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths from developing countries and minorities in HICs are lacking. We should obtain these data through community health workers, such as accredited social health activists and Anganwadi workers in India, and social leaders to measure the true burden and identify the barriers in accessing health care during the pandemic. To identify the disparities within and across countries, a COVID-19 dashboard showing live data on COVID-19 as well as non-COVID-19 morbidity and mortality according to race, ethnicity, gender, region, and religion should be developed.Although it might not be easy for pandemic-affected overburdened health-care infrastructure, a systems approach with strong leadership could pave a way for a better future.The recent surge in the use of information technology with increased access to mobile phones and internet, and judicious use of data analytic technology and telemedicine, could benefit the delivery of care to previously inaccessible people. We need to take immediate remedial measures at a global level to get back on track for attaining the SDGs and ENAP goals.

We declare no competing interests.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to 684,000, the fewest since the pandemic erupted a year ago and a sign that the economy is improving.

Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell from 781,000 the week before. It is the first time that weekly applications for jobless aid have fallen below 700,000 since mid-March of last year. Before the pandemic tore through the economy, applications had never topped that level.

The number of people seeking benefits under a federal program for self-employed and contract workers also dropped, to 241,000, from 284,000 a week earlier. All told, the number of applicants fell below 1 million for the first time since the pandemic.

Economists are growing more optimistic that the pace of layoffs, which has been chronically high for a full year, is finally easing.

“While the level of claims remains elevated,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, “we expect they will continue to recede as the recovery gains momentum.”

Still, a total of 18.9 million people are continuing to collect jobless benefits, up from 18.2 million in the previous week. Roughly one-third of those recipients are in extended federal aid programs, which means they’ve been unemployed for at least six months.

Their prolonged joblessness could prove to be a long-term hindrance: Typically, many people who have been unemployed for extended periods struggle to find work even as the economy regains its health.

The economy has been showing signs of emerging from the pandemic crisis with renewed vigor, with spending picking up, manufacturing strengthening and employers adding workers. Hiring increased in February, with 379,000 added jobs — more than double January’s total. The economy expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the final three months of last year, the government estimated Thursday, slightly faster than its previous estimate. That pace is widely expected to accelerate in the coming months, fueled by substantial government rescue aid.

Credit card data from JPMorgan Chase showed that consumer spending jumped last week as the $1,400 checks that are going to most adults under President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion emergency aid package began to be paid out. The Treasury says it has so far distributed 127 million payments worth $325 billion.

Last week, Federal Reserve policymakers substantially boosted their forecast for the economy this year, anticipating growth of 6.5% for 2021, up from an estimate of just 4.2% three months ago. That would be the fastest rate of expansion in any year since 1984. The Fed also projects that the unemployment rate will reach 4.5% by the end of this year, down from the current 6.2%.

Some individual states reported sharp drops in applications for aid last week. In Illinois, they tumbled 80% to just under 15,000. In Ohio, which several weeks ago had flagged a significant portion of claims as fraudulent, they fell by nearly a third to 69,000.

Nationally, though, the number of recipients in an extended federal jobless benefits program jumped by 730,000 to 5.5 million. Nearly all the increase occurred in California, which has a biweekly filing system that can cause sharp fluctuations, up or down, from week to week.

Historically, the weekly unemployment claims figure has been considered an accurate reflection of the pace of layoffs. But that connection has weakened during the pandemic. Widespread fraud and the processing of backlogged claims have distorted many states’ jobless aid data. That has been particularly true for the federal program that covers self-employed and gig workers; this data has fluctuated wildly in many states.

And a report from the California Policy Lab last week illustrated another complicating factor: Many people have applied multiple times during the pandemic, having been initially laid off or furloughed, then been called back to work, then been laid off again. Each layoff has triggered a new application for unemployment benefits.

The Policy Lab’s report found that 75% of jobless claims in California in the final week of February were from people who had previously been laid off and applied for benefits.

Across the country, economic activity slowed in February as severe winter weather caused sharp drops in home sales , retail spending and orders for heavy factory goods . Most economists, though, say they think the economy is now rebounding as the weather improves and additional support from the new $1.9 trillion federal rescue package kicks in.

Some analysts are increasingly optimistic that hiring will accelerate quickly this year. Two senior fellows at the Brookings Institution have forecast that employers will add a substantial 700,000 to 1 million jobs per month, on average, over the next 10 months. At the higher end of that estimate, the economy by year’s end would have regained all the 9.5 million jobs that remain lost to the pandemic.

There are still risks that could frustrate such hopes. The number of new daily coronavirus infections has leveled off, though hospitalizations and deaths continue to fall. And as many states have dropped or relaxed pandemic-related restrictions on gatherings and business activity, another wave of infections could weigh on the economy.

Though growth may accelerate this year, hiring often lags behind economic growth as businesses wait to see if rising demand is sustainable. What’s more, roughly 4 million Americans stopped looking for work during the pandemic and aren’t counted in the unemployment rate. Most of them will need to be re-hired for the economic recovery to be fully complete."
