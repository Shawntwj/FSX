The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has exposed two aspects of medical materials: the increased waste of medical supply (gloves) and the improved functionality of protective materials (masks).
Another seemingly unrelated source of environment pollution is from the food processing industry.
Food waste processing and treatment through incinerator and landfill in turn results in a higher carbon footprint.
To reduce global food waste and the global carbon footprint, food tech innovations have been developed to recover nutrients and convert the solid residues to usable materials.
Such innovations have unexpectedly connected the two sources of environment pollution: food processing side-streams and medical materials.
