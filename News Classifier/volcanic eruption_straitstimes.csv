""There was a huge orange light,"" said Mr Vela-Fonseca, who was on a scientific expedition in the area when Wolf Volcano began spewing ash and lava on the night of Jan 6.
Neither the ash clouds nor the lava cascading down the volcano's slopes posed a safety risk to the people on the expedition.
""The magmas erupted on Wolf Volcano do not contain very much gas, but they're also very hot and runny, which allows any gas bubbles which are present to easily escape,"" Dr Stock said.
Dr Carrión captured the early stages of the eruption in a time-lapse video that he shot from near the top of the roughly 1,700m volcano.","wolf, mesmerising, galápagos, volcano, lava, dr, theyre, ash, galapagos, gas, produces, river, volcanoes, velafonseca",natural calamities,geophysical event

A team of veterinarians is caring for the birds, bathing them with special detergents to remove the suffocating oil.
""We have never seen anything like this in the history of Peru,"" said Ms Bermudez, while tending to a bird.
The abnormally large waves were triggered by the eruption of an undersea volcano near the archipelago of Tonga, thousands of kilometres away.
The spill near Lima has fouled beaches and harmed the fishing and tourism industries, with crews working non-stop to clean up the mess.","spilled, birds, eruption, save, threatened, sea, undersea, volcano, penguins, zoo, oil, lima, waves, triggered, tonga, races, peru, spill",natural calamities,geophysical event

The unusual ""astounding"" speed and force of the eruption indicated a greater force at play than simply magma meeting water, scientists said.
Some volcanologists are likening the eruption to the 1991 Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, which killed around 800 people.
The Tonga Geological Services agency, which was monitoring the volcano, was unreachable on Monday.

65,Jan-20,"MANILA • An explosive eruption of the restive Taal volcano in the Philippines no longer appears imminent, the authorities said yesterday as they lifted most of a mass evacuation order but warned residents to remain ready to flee.

Warning signs like earthquakes have been steadily waning since Taal burst to life two weeks ago, sending up plumes of ash and lava and forcing over 135,000 people into shelters over fears that a massive blast was coming.

The nation's seismological agency said the steadily shrinking ash and gas emissions were signs of ""decreased tendency towards hazardous explosive eruption"", leading them to drop the alert by a notch.

The immediate impact of the reduced warning was the lifting of the evacuation order for nearly all the towns that ring the volcano that sits in the middle of a lake and is a big tourist attraction.

""Residents of all towns under lockdown except Agoncillo and Laurel now have the option to return,"" local governor Hermilando Mandanas told a press conference. But he warned: ""There's a possibility that the volcano may still erupt and we should still be ready to evacuate in one hour.""

No one is known to have died in the eruption, but the ash it unleashed had earlier forced the brief closure of Manila's main international airport, stranding tens of thousands of travellers.

The volcano shot ash 15km high and spewed lava in the Jan 12 eruption, which crushed scores of homes and killed livestock as well as crops.

134,Dec-18,"Indonesia on Thursday (Dec 27) raised the danger alert level for the Anak Krakatau volcano amid signs of increased activity, after its eruption last weekend triggered a deadly tsunami. Flights around the volcano, which sits in between the islands of Java and Sumatra, were also redirected.

Here's a look at Indonesia's volcanic hot spots.

Why is Indonesia prone to quakes and eruptions?

Indonesia is a vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"". The Ring is a 40,000km arc that stretches from New Zealand, to Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan, across to Alaska, the United States, Mexico to the southern tip of South America. It is where tectonic plates collide and a large portion of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

The United States Geological Survey says more than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean to form the Ring of Fire, while about 90 per cent of the world's earthquakes occur along the ring.

How many volcanoes does Indonesia have, and how many of them are active?

Indonesia has 127 active volcanoes, with seven of them currently in the 'eruption phase', the Sydney Morning Herald reported, citing volcanologist Janine Krippner at West Virginia's Concord University.

198,Dec-18,"Indonesia's Geological Agency said it has yet to collect adequate data to determine whether the eruptions of the Anak Krakatau volcano caused, or partly caused, the high waves on Saturday night that crashed into houses and other buildings in the coastal areas in the western tip of Java and southern tip of Sumatra.

Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB said the tsunami was caused by ""an undersea landslide resulting from volcanic activity on Anak Krakatau"", and was exacerbated by an abnormally high tide because of the current full moon.

Indonesian Tsunami Expert Association chairman Gegar Prasetya said that based on the meteorological data, there was no earthquake or storm on Saturday and, therefore, the tsunami was linked to the activities of Mount Anak Krakatau in the Sunda Strait.

It was likely caused by a flank collapse, triggered by the increasing geological activities of the volcano, he added.

""The eruption of Anak Krakatau potentially had made the slope unstable and then the flank collapsed,"" Dr Gegar told The Straits Times.

He further said that such a tsunami might have occurred in the past as part of the formation process of Anak Krakatau, but the incident was unmonitored and no casualties were recorded, as local people did not erect buildings close to the seashore.

Going forward, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency must enhance its early warning system by covering phenomena other than tectonic earthquakes, Dr Gegar added.
