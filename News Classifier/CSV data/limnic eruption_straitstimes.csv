0,Oct-19,Something about Montreal singer,Songs of baptism and communion,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/songs-of-baptism-and-communion,"Something about Montreal singer-songwriter Patrick Watson's latest album reminds me of a scene in Barry Jenkins' Oscar-winning film Moonlight (2016).
Juan (played by Mahershala Ali), a drug dealer who becomes an unlikely father figure, takes little Chiron (played by Alex Hibbert) out to the sea.
Such is the richly cinematic mood Watson evokes in his band's sixth studio release, aptly titled Wave.
His band's name is Patrick Watson.
Just like the above scene, the songs are as much baptism as communion, riding the line between danger and faith, dream and reality.","songs, chiron, bands, watson, played, wave, patrick, album, scene, communion, singing, wipe, baptism",natural calamities,geophysical event
1,Oct-18,BANGKOK (NYTIMES) ,Indonesia plane crash leaves experts puzzled,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-plane-crash-leaves-experts-puzzled,"But shortly after 6.30am on Monday morning (Oct 29), after a jagged take-off full of unexplained descents, Lion Air Flight JT610 plunged into the Java Sea with 189 people on board.
But the crash took place in broad daylight and good weather, and involved a new plane.
""This doesn't seem like a more normal crash caused by something like weather or an old plane,"" said Mr Gerry Soejatman, an Indonesian aviation expert.
And they may have been the issue the night before the crash, when the same Lion Air plane experienced problems flying to Jakarta from the resort island of Bali.
On Tuesday afternoon, Indonesian transportation officials acknowledged that they had not spoken to ground crews about the plane and the problems it experienced after it left Bali.","air, indonesian, aviation, problems, indonesia, puzzled, leaves, transportation, plane, flight, crash, experts, weather, safety",natural calamities,geophysical event
2,Nov-18,"In the age of #MeToo, the indie",The strength of a trio of stellar songwriters,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/the-strength-of-a-trio-of-stellar-songwriters,"In the age of #MeToo, the indie-folk-rock supergroup boygenius are ironically named - not least because their members are all women.
The title of the trio (and its eponymous EP) then works as both humblebrag validation and utter rebuke - it validates the immense talent that these artists possess while undercutting the gender stereotyping.
You can call it the millennial response to case/lang/veirs, the acclaimed collaboration by more established sistas - Neko Case, k.d.
The first track, Bite The Hand, is led by Dacus, who goes for the jugular with her lyrical directness.
""I can't hear you, the light is in my face/I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could,"" she sings over tightly wound guitars.","songwriters, trio, cant, womeneach, 23, youthfulnessthe, works, whiff, stellar, wound, wouldnt, virginia, strength, dacus",natural calamities,geophysical event
3,Apr-17,"That is enough for some visitors. ""All the world must see what is happening in the West Bank,"" said Emad Khleif, 50, a Palestinian banker who brought his family to visit from Nazareth.

But not all locals are happy with the hotel. (""Who is this for?"" barked a Palestinian woman, Sowsan Hashem, 49, standing just outside.) Some foreign visitors said it made them a little queasy. Part of the blame might come from Banksy's unsubtle, commercial style. Part is from a feeling of ""oppression tourism"", which allows those who pay US$20 or so to stencil political messages on the wall with spray paint. Part is that the hotel is just, well, pretty nice, given everything.

""Decadent"" was the word used by one guest, Michael McLaughlin, 35, who noted the difference between the hotel and the Palestinian refugee camp where he had just spent a week as part of his work as an actor and a film","'Weird', 'voyeuristic', 'decadent': Banksy hotel in the West Bank proves popular",https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/weird-voyeuristic-decadent-banksy-hotel-in-the-west-bank,"""All the world must see what is happening in the West Bank,"" said Emad Khleif, 50, a Palestinian banker who brought his family to visit from Nazareth.
A major retrospective of Banksy's work that opened a week ago just outside Tel Aviv is to run through Tuesday.
The motif is best described as decadent colonial, but in place of mounted deer heads are security cameras and slingshots.
A gallery upstairs, where paintings by Palestinian artists can run up to US$10,000, features even more valuable works by Banksy himself.
Finally, there is the wall itself: The concrete - visible from most parts of this hotel only feet away - is covered with graffiti.","hotel, world, west, bank, works, voyeuristic, decadent, weird, palestinian, work, israeli, popular, stencil, proves, banksy, wall, website",natural calamities,geophysical event
4,Apr-17,"NEW YORK • James Rosenquist, who helped define Pop Art in its 1960s heyday with his boldly scaled painted montages of commercial imagery, died last Friday in New York City. He was 83. His wife, Mimi Thompson, said he died at his home after a long illness.

Like his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Rosenquist developed a powerful graphic style in the early 1960s that traditionalists reviled and a broad public enthusiastically embraced.

The Pop Art artists took for their subject matter images and objects from the mass media and popular culture, including advertising, comic books as well as consumer products.

They also employed techniques that until then had been associated primarily with commercial and industrial methods of production, such as silk screening or, in Rosenquist's case, billboard painting.

He drew on his experience painting immense movie billboards above Times Square and a Hebrew National sign in Brooklyn.

It was while working in New York as a sign painter by day and an abstract painter by night that he had the idea to import the giant",From sign painter to Pop Art pioneer,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/from-sign-painter-to-pop-art-pioneer,"NEW YORK • James Rosenquist, who helped define Pop Art in its 1960s heyday with his boldly scaled painted montages of commercial imagery, died last Friday in New York City.
The Pop Art artists took for their subject matter images and objects from the mass media and popular culture, including advertising, comic books as well as consumer products.
The naked efficiency of anti-personal art-making defines classic Pop Art.
That same year, his work was included in a survey of new art at Sidney Janis Gallery called International Exhibition Of The New Realists that put what would become known as Pop Art on the map of contemporary consciousness.
In 1965, he showed F-111 in his first exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery, which by then represented most major Pop Art artists.","painting, painter, panels, images, sign, paintings, pioneer, work, art, pop, rosenquist, york",natural calamities,geophysical event

Who knows what 2017 will bring, but to start things on a bright note, there are several events I look forward to on the music front, from album releases to a living legend's new musical.

Hong Kong's Eason Chan is a great singer in top form and he has released at least one album or EP a year since 2005. He is adventurous when it comes to his music outings ",What will theatre giant Stephen Sondheim at age 86 bring us this year?,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/promising-sounds-of-2017,"Hong Kong's Eason Chan is a great singer in top form and he has released at least one album or EP a year since 2005.
She has been having fun playing around with Mando-dance-pop, stretching the genre and proving it can be more than throwaway fluff.
The concept here is an autobiographical album with one track for each year of frontman and songwriter Stephin Merritt's life.
When it comes to penning words set to music, theatre giant Stephen Sondheim is in a class of his own.

The music is a stately spew of drones and ivory pinks, which moves and never follows a particular trajectory.
Whereas in the past, Cave's wrestling with matters of life and death, evil and goodness can seem admirably philosophical, here it cuts to the bone.
He feels bottomless sadness, repeating the title in I Need You.
The song bleeds into Girl In Amber, a majestic dirge where his voice, bruised and almost airless, confronts some hard truths.","bottomless, world, nick, title, sadness, week, album, death, feels, music, song, reaches, hard, cave, haunts, sons, caves, think",natural calamities,geophysical event
