Twelve people trapped in a tunnel have been rescued and efforts were under way to save others caught in another tunnel, the federal Home Ministry said after a meeting of the National Crisis Committee, comprising top officials.

With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with mud and rocks and paramilitary rescuers had to climb down a hillside using ropes to get access to the entrance.

Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing the massive burst of water tearing through a narrow valley below the power plant, leaving roads and bridges destroyed in its wake. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation. ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" Mr Modi said on Twitter.

The accident was a further blow to an area struggling to emerge from many days of heavy snowfall, a series of earthquakes and an avalanche last week that killed at least 17 people, with 12 still missing.

The cause of the crash on Tuesday was not immediately clear, though television images from the site, which showed that only the rear of the helicopter remained intact, were occasionally blurred by fog.

Mayor Gianluca Marrocchi of the nearby town of Lucoli told RAI state television that he had seen the helicopter and had wondered ""why it was flying so low"".

The helicopter was taking the skier from Campo Felice, a ski resort in the Apennine Mountains, when it went down, said the National Agency for Flight Safety, which ordered a probe and sent a team to the site. It said in a statement that the area is difficult to reach because of ""adverse meteorological conditions"".

The news dealt a fresh blow to the Abruzzo region, where rescuers have been involved in countless operations over the last week after heavy snow and power cuts isolated many towns and an avalanche demolished a hotel following strong quakes on Wednesday last week.

The death toll rose to 17 on Tuesday after the body of a woman was removed from the ruins of the hotel. Twelve people are still missing, while nine were rescued last week. Two of the people who died in the helicopter had searched for survivors at the hotel, a spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency said.

Mr Luciano D'Alfonso, president of the Abruzzo region, sent his condolences to the families of the victims via Twitter. He said he was praying ""for the end of the sequence of tragic events that has struck Abruzzo"".

Rescuers continued to search for survivors at the Hotel Rigopiano.

To be sure, the race to the top is driven by the weather. May is the best time of the year to summit, but even then there are only a few days when it is clear enough and the winds are mild enough to make an attempt at the top.

But one of the critical problems this year, veterans say, seems to be the sheer number of people trying to reach the summit at the same time. And since there is no government traffic cop high on the mountain, the task of deciding when groups get to attempt their final ascent is left up to mountaineering companies.

Climbers themselves, experienced or not, are often so driven to finish their quest that they may keep going even if they see the dangers escalating.

Since then, the sequence of more than 360,000 genomes of the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, submitted by more than 145 countries, have been shared.
And the team from Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), played a major role in setting up and maintaining the database to share and analyse the genomes.
By February, the team in Singapore had developed software to rapidly check the genomes for errors and recruited volunteers, notably from the Genome Institute of Singapore.","check, singapore, bii, team, worked, big, played, role, pandemic, helped, sequence, astar, genomes, fight, world, software, dr, covid19, global",natural calamities

Traffic jams create dangerous situations for climbers, who are often already exhausted and carrying heavy loads while battling altitude sickness, which can make people dizzy and nauseated.

Gordan Janow, director of programs at Alpine Ascents International, has been organising treks to Everest for around 30 years. He said overcrowding often occurs, but ""every year seems to be worse and worse"".

When a line starts to back up, ""you're changing your natural pace so you're spending more time in this high altitude zone than might be necessary if you were climbing 10 to 15 years ago,"" he said.

Alpine Ascents currently has a group of a dozen climbers on the mountain, he said. And one of the most important skills for the guides who accompany them, he said, ""is knowing when to turn people around"".

""The idea isn't to push yourself to the ultimate maximum to reach the summit,"" he said. ""Then there's no steam or energy left in your body to get down.""

Everest attracts climbers from around the globe, and the victims come from a diverse set of backgrounds: Séamus Lawless, an assistant professor of computer science at Trinity College in Ireland, went missing last Thursday when he slipped and fell shortly near the summit, on a different side of the mountain from where the main traffic jam is taking place.

On Friday, the Independent reported that a second Irish climber, Kevin Hynes, died on Friday. He had climbed parts of Everest before, and the British group he travelled with, 360 Expeditions, said in a statement he was ""one of the strongest and most experienced climbers on our team"".

317,07/2018,"Shortly after the reports surfaced, the Imperial Household Agency announced that Mr Komuro and the princess, the niece of Crown Prince Naruhito, who will ascend to the throne when his father abdicates next spring, would postpone their wedding, originally scheduled for this fall, to 2020.

That has fuelled speculation that the relationship may be on the rocks.

The agency, which closely guards every tradition associated with the royal family, also indefinitely delayed a formal royal engagement ceremony, known as Nosai no Gi, for the princess and Mr Komuro.

So when Fordham, in announcing that Mr Komuro would embark on a master's degree in law on a full scholarship in August, described him as the princess' fiancé, the designation ruffled the Imperial Household Agency.

Mr Komuro ""does not have the status of being engaged and therefore is not a fiancé"", an agency spokesman told reporters this week in Tokyo.

In a statement, Fordham Law said it had decided to amend the news release after consulting with both the agency and Mr Komuro.

""Out of respect for the long traditions and practices of the Imperial Household Agency, we decided to remove the word 'fiancé' from the announcement because the betrothal ceremony has not yet been held,"" it said.

Japanese tabloids speculated that either the Imperial Household Agency had nudged Mr Komuro out of the country or that he had decided to flee to the United States to escape continuous prying by the news media. Commentators on social media were swift to criticise Mr Komuro's motives.

On Twitter, @momimojiko suggested that Mr Komuro had used his connection to Princess Mako to gain admission and a scholarship from Fordham and its prestigious law school.

""He will betray us again and again in the future,"" @momimojiko wrote. ""The engagement should be cancelled immediately, like tomorrow.""

Another Twitter user, @marimo555555, addressed the princess directly. ""Mako, why don't you drop him quickly? Wake up. Rather than waiting for him for three years, it's better to split up from him and ask your mother to introduce you to a good man.""

The harsh criticism of Mr Komuro, whose father was a municipal official who died when Mr Komuro was quite young, stems from the strong Japanese cultural sense of the importance of a family line.

""Japanese people still put importance on family when talking about marriage,"" said reporter Yukiya Chikashige at a women's magazine, Josei Jishin, who frequently writes about the royal family. Chikashige said that critics had questioned why Mr Komuro's mother needed to borrow money and whether he would earn enough to support the princess after the marriage.

For now, the couple have not suggested that the marriage is in jeopardy. When the wedding was postponed, the princess issued a statement saying that the couple ""came to recognise the lack of time to make sufficient preparations"".

If the wedding had gone ahead as originally scheduled, it would have come just months before Emperor Akihito's planned abdication next April. The 84","He's supposed to marry a Japanese princess, just don't call Kei Komuro her fiancé",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hes-supposed-to-marry-a-japanese-princess-just-dont-call-kei-komuro-her-fiance,"Mr Komuro ""does not have the status of being engaged and therefore is not a fiancé"", an agency spokesman told reporters this week in Tokyo.

""Imran Khan is worried in case I portray him as a sex symbol,"" wrote the London newspaper journalist sent to interview him. ""This is possibly why Imran is stretched across his hotel bed wearing only a petulant expression and a pair of tiny, black satin shorts.""

But a complex, mysterious transformation would begin soon after. In 1992, Khan captained Pakistan's cricket team to a World Cup victory over England, the country's former colonial ruler. It was a moment of immense Pakistani pride, and Mr Khan was at the centre of it.

But looking back on it, he told interviewers, he felt empty. He began to stay away from the clubs, the partying, the girlfriends.

He began a quest to build a cancer hospital in Pakistan for the poor; his mother had died of cancer, and the two had been close. He turned to Islam and the Sufi sect, which he said helped lend purpose to his life.

Then he entered politics. Pakistan in the late 1990s was a mess: Its Machiavellian spy services were working with the United States, and at the same time, supporting the Taleban and Osama bin Laden.

Mr Wynn, 76, has denied the accusations published by The Wall Street Journal as ""preposterous"" and said they were instigated by his former wife, an accusation that a representative for Ms Elaine Wynn has denied.

She is an instinctively cautious politician. Yet she can also be very courageous.

She joined mainstream politics from East Germany, at a time when few took seriously anyone coming from the former communist east. She made a bid for the leadership of the ruling Christian Democrats at a time when few believed a woman could become a national leader. And as Russian troops intervened in Ukraine in 2014, Dr Merkel brushed aside opposition from her own colleagues and German business interests, and led Europe in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. She may be cautious, but she also knows when to throw caution to the winds.

She is a terrible public speaker, wooden and uncomfortable when facing crowds. But she also attracts fierce loyalty, remains by far the most popular German leader, and is universally known as ""mutti"", the affectionate German term for mother. The secret of Dr Merkel's success is that she embodies the key virtues of ordinary Germans: seriousness, hard work, disdain for showy gestures and an instinctive caution about experimentation.

Still, Dr Merkel, 63, seems doomed to spend next year just trying to survive at the top. Her party clings to power but, having achieved its lowest score in more than half a century at the general election in September, it is also considerably weakened.

Dr Merkel's decline is usually explained by her decision in 2015 to open Germany's door to a million refugees from the Middle East, a move at that time hailed around the world, but now regarded as a catastrophic political mistake, which alienated millions of voters and contributed to the rise of the populist Alternative for Germany.

390,11/2017,"Intrigued by the link between the mind and performance, he studied Sports and Human Movement at Stellenbosch University after completing his military stint.

His first job was in his uncle's business which imported and exported fresh produce.

It didn't take long for him to make a ton of money selling cabbage, a staple in South Africa. Noticing that the country sometimes experiences a cold frost in winter when cabbage rots, he created an artificial demand. He bought supplies from farmers and made them happy by paying a higher price, and kept the cabbage in massive cooler rooms.

As he predicted, the black frost came the year he came up with the scheme. ""All of a sudden, the big supermarkets that bought always from certain guys had no cabbage, had to come to me. And I said: 'You can only buy cabbage now if you keep on buying from me.' Maybe too quickly in my life, I earned a lot of money,"" he recalls with a chortle.

Only in his early 20s at that time, he had everything he wanted but he soon got bored. So he gave everything, including his house and car, away to family and friends and took off for the airport one day with just enough money in his pocket for an air ticket.

At the airport, he hopped on a plane to Zurich. ""I didn't know what I was going to do, I only had 50 bucks in my pocket and I couldn't speak French, German or Italian. So when I got out of that plane and got my backpack, I just thought: S**t!""

From Zurich, he went to Montreux and tried looking for work.

Nobody he approached would give him work when he told them he was South African. ""They would say: 'You're racist. We don't agree with South Africans, especially white South Africans.'""

To survive, he started pilfering fruits and tomatoes from gardens and taking unsold bread in supermarkets at the end of the day.

After a month, he decided to hitchhike to Israel, hoping to find work in the military or maybe a job in a kibbutz.

A guy in a pink car painted with flowers stopped for him and gave him a ride to a small village in the Swiss Alps.

It was late at night when they reached the village, so the driver, who ran a youth hostel, asked him to stay in the hostel that night.

""I told him: 'Sorry, I can't sleep in the youth hostel, I don't have money.' He said, 'Okay, you can wash the dishes and clean the rooms to pay for the room.'

Horn proved to be such a great help that the hostel owner offered him a job. He stayed, taught himself how to ski and soon became good enough to become a ski instructor.

""Then the summer came and they needed a rafting guide to take tourists down the river and although I never rafted, I said: 'I will try.' Then the tourist office in the region who had heard about me came and said: 'You know how to work with clients and people and we would like to employ you.'""

When he was not working, the adrenaline junkie sought out thrills on his own, jumping off bridges and riverboarding down rapids.

When he heard that an Italian watch company Sector was looking for riverboarders for an ad campaign, he took his flippers and boogie board and went for it.

Because he had no newspaper articles or photos of his exploits, he reckoned the best way to nab the gig was to show the two Italian interviewers what he could do.

""The Agung volcano commenced a sustained ash eruption on Saturday, with plumes reaching 3,000 m high,"" explained Mark Tingay, a geologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia.","major, eruption, volcanic, agung, volcano, lava, mount, eruptions, inevitable, university, indonesias, experts, potentially, ash",natural calamities

Although the I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali had resumed operations after being shut down due to volcanic ash fall over the last two days, a major eruption of Mount Agung is still expected.
""Mount Agung is still emitting black and white smoke continuously, and we have already see fire, and rivers are flooded with ash,"" Ms Kumari told The Straits Times.
Ms Kumari said there were also many who have been staying at the shelters since Mount Agung first showed signs of an awakening in September.
Mr Ni Made Soni, 47, said volcanic ash fall has not spread to his estate in Denpasar possibly because of the rain - November is traditionally when the wet season begins in Bali.","residents, regency, mr, masks, volcanic, agung, mount, evacuated, ni, bali, shelters, 38000, ash",natural calamities

A giant, suffocating ash cloud hovers over the Indonesian island, and neither geologists nor local officials know what the simmering volcano will do next.
Mount Agung has been actively erupting for a week, but it started to rumble back in September, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes.
The vast majority of those deaths were caused by the eruption's pyroclastic flow - a high-speed wall of ash, debris and hot gas that surged down the mountainside.

394,11/2017,"JAKARTA • Karangasem regency in east Bali, where Mount Agung lies, was once a rich kingdom that also ruled the western regions of Lombok island until it was conquered by the Dutch in 1894.

Its people were dealt another blow in 1963 when the volcano erupted twice between March and May that year, claiming more than 1,500 lives.

The eyes of the world were on the regency again after Mount Agung slowly awoke over the last week, before violently roaring to life on Sunday, producing a dramatic rising column of ash cloud from magma.

The eruptions, said to be precursors of an imminent and larger blowout ahead, were followed by a pyroclastic avalanche of gas, mudflows and ash fall over the eastern side of the island.

Yesterday, more than 38,000 people living in villages across Karangasem were evacuated to the 217 shelters located on the fringes of the regency.

Ms Ni Ketut Puspa Kumari, who is in charge of social services in the regency, said there are still thousands more who need to make their way to shelters, either by themselves or with help from Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), police, military, and search and rescue agency Basarnas.

According to a census conducted in 2002, there are about 369,320 people in Karangasem, about a quarter of whom live inside the 10km exclusion zone of the volcano.

BNPB spokesman Sutopo Nugroho had said earlier that many villagers refused to be evacuated because they feel the situation is still safe and they are reluctant to abandon their cattle.

Although the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali has resumed operations after being shut down over the last two days, a major eruption of Mount Agung is still expected.

""Mount Agung is still emitting black and white smoke continuously, and we have already seen fire, and rivers are flooded with ash,"" Ms Kumari told The Straits Times yesterday.

President Joko Widodo yesterday also weighed in and appealed to residents to evacuate to safety. Speaking to reporters in Jakarta, he said: ""I do not want any victims because of this eruption.""

Local emergency services, meanwhile, have been scrambling to stock evacuation shelters with sufficient supplies as the number of displaced residents began to climb after thousands were forced to abandon their homes.

When The Straits Times visited a shelter in Rendang district on Tuesday, Madam Ni Wayan Wati was huddled together with her four grandchildren under a small makeshift tent, trying to avoid the rain as well as the hazardous volcanic ash falling from the skies following the eruptions at Mount Agung.

Madam Wati and four of her children were evacuated to Rendang, a village located about 5km from her home in Banjar Besakih Kawan, three days ago.

Banjar Besakih Kawan village, as well as others such as Kubu, are some of the districts that are at high risk of being wiped out if a major eruption occurs, said Ms Kumari.

Madam Wati told The Straits Times: ""My village was heavily covered with volcanic ash, I was so afraid... The government then ordered us to evacuate, so we just came here.""

But life at the shelter, set up at a farming complex in Rendang, has not been easy, especially with the rainy season kicking in.

On their first night, heavy rain flooded the area. With half of the tents there yet to have tarpaulin covers over the bamboo frames, many families were drenched.

""See for yourself, if there are no tarpaulins for everyone, how can we take shelter, let alone sleep in peace?"" added Madam Wati.

Since the outbreak of the scandal, more than two dozen actresses including Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Lea Seydoux have come forward saying they were sexually harassed by the producer.

The latest allegations involved the former Bond Girl Eva Green, whose mother told French radio that Weinstein had harassed her daughter for months, and British actress Alice Evans, who penned an essay for The Telegraph claiming she had rejected his advances, and believes it may have harmed her career.

'SICK AND DEPRAVED'

Weinstein was seen in public for the first time in days when paparazzi descended upon him as he left his daughter's home in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

""Guys, I'm not doing OK but I'm trying,"" he said in a video obtained by ABC. ""I got to get help. You know what, we all make mistakes.""

As he climbed into an oversized sports utility vehicle, he said he hoped people would give him ""a second chance.""

Celebrity gossip portal TMZ reported that Weinstein later flew to rehab in Arizona, possibly at The Meadows, a facility near Phoenix where golfer Tiger Woods and supermodel Kate Moss have been treated.

Weinstein's brother and business partner Bob told The Hollywood Reporter in an emotional interview published on Saturday that he knew the tycoon was a cheater, but said he was unaware of the extent of his ""sick and depraved"" behaviour.

""For me, I thought he was literally just going out there cheating in a pervasive way,"" he is quoted as saying.

""It wasn't like he even had a mistress. It was one after another and that I was aware of. But as far as being in a room and hearing the description in The New York Times? No way.""

Weinstein appears to have garnered little sympathy from the public, either, according to a survey conducted by celebrity branding expert and bestselling author Jeetendr Sehdev.

Some 82 per cent of 2,000 people questioned as part of an ongoing study into American attitudes to celebrity and entertainment said he should be kicked out of the Academy.

Six in 10 said they would be less likely to watch the annual Oscars ceremony if Weinstein was allowed to remain and 40 per cent wanted him to be stripped of the Oscar he won for producing Shakespeare In Love (1998).

'SLEAZY'

More broadly, a striking half of respondents said they now viewed Hollywood as a ""sleazy"" brand.

Hollywood, too, has largely turned its back on Weinstein, with veteran filmmaker Oliver Stone and fashion designer Donna Karan offering the only words of support.

While Stone merely warned against Weinstein being ""condemned by a vigilante system,"" Karan went further, triggering outrage when she suggested women had been seeking a reaction from Weinstein by dressing provocatively.

Several people have fallen foul of contempt laws in this category for impugning the integrity and reputation of the Singapore judiciary, including opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, American academic Christopher Lingle, British author Alan Shadrake and sociopolitical blogger Alex Au .

In Shadrake's case, Justice Quentin Loh ruled in 2010 that for a statement to be in contempt, it had to have a ""real risk"" of scandalising the judiciary. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In other words, a statement must carry a real likelihood of undermining public confidence in the justice system.

The Bill modifies the test for scandalising the judiciary from one of ""real risk"" to one of just ""risk"".

In response to WP MP Sylvia Lim, Mr Shanmugam explained that while judges develop common law based strictly on legal precedents, the Government looked at the larger implications of the law on the country, including the need to protect the judiciary as an institution, given Singapore's reputation as a jurisdiction known for independence and impartiality.
