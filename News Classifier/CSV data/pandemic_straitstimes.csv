“This pandemic is nowhere near over,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters from the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva.
The UN health agency chief warned against dismissing as mild the coronavirus variant Omicron, which has spread like wildfire around the globe since it was first detected in southern Africa in November.
The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is much more contagious than previous strains but seems to cause less serious disease.

The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it even more difficult for people to pay for healthcare, according to a joint statement from both the organisations.
Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on health care systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage, which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship.
Globally, the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in ten years, with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing.

The forecast from the Madrid-based United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) comes as Europe is grappling with a surge in infections and as a new heavily mutated Covid-19 variant, named Omicron, spreads across the globe.
The global tourism sector already lost US$2 trillion in revenue last year because of the pandemic, according to the UNWTO, making it one of sectors hit hardest by the health crisis.
While international tourism has taken a hit from the outbreak of disease in the past, the coronavirus is unprecedented in its geographical spread.

239,10/2021,(FINANCIAL TIMES) ,Pandemic stimulus has backfired in emerging markets,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/pandemic-stimulus-has-backfired-in-emerging-markets,"(FINANCIAL TIMES) - From the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many emerging nations watched the United States and other large developed countries ""go big"" on economic stimulus, and wished they could afford to follow.
It turns out they were lucky if they couldn't and wise if they chose not to.
Emerging markets that stimulated most aggressively received no pay-off in a faster recovery, owing in part to the downsides of overindulging.
The big spenders tended to suffer higher inflation, higher interest rates and currency depreciation, at least partly cancelling out the sugar high of stimulus.","times, big, watched, markets, wished, pandemic, turns, backfired, emerging, higher, united, wise, toemerging, stimulus",Human health crises
