0,Nov-21,SINGAPORE ,"Easing of Covid-19 travel restrictions in S'pore could lead to uptick in flu cases, doctors warn",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/easing-of-covid-19-travel-restrictions-in-spore-could-lead-to-uptick-in-flu-cases-doctors,"SINGAPORE - People should take their flu jabs to protect against concurrent infection of both Covid-19 and the flu, which can lead to severe disease, doctors have advised.
This is especially important as Singapore continues to ease its travel restrictions and opens up its borders, they said, adding that influenza cases can be expected to rise.
In Singapore, Covid-19 safe management measures such as social distancing and mask wearing have been known to keep in check other unrelated respiratory virus infections, including influenza and the common cold.
These risks could be mitigated if more people also get vaccinated for flu on top of the Covid-19 vaccines.
In comparison, Singapore saw a higher number of flu cases in December 2019 and January 2020, which typically coincides with year-end spikes as people usually travel overseas, said Dr Maiwald.","number, easing, lead, restrictions, flu, virus, warn, spore, respiratory, doctors, singapore, covid19, uptick, study, wearing, safe, travel",Human health crises,pandemic

3,Sep-21,WASHINGTON (AFP) ,Pfizer launches mRNA flu vaccine trial,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/pfizer-launches-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial,"WASHINGTON (AFP) - US pharmaceutical company Pfizer said Monday (Sept 27) it had begun a clinical trial to test an influenza vaccine designed with the same mRNA technology behind its successful Covid-19 shot.
""The Covid-19 pandemic allowed us to deliver on the immense scientific opportunity of mRNA,"" Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research at Pfizer, said in a statement.
Specifically, Pfizer wants to compare the safety and level of immune response of a single, double and quadruple strain mRNA vaccine at different dosage levels versus a conventional, licensed quadruple strain vaccine.
Pfizer began work on its mRNA influenza vaccine in 2018 with its German partner BioNTech, which would receive a royalty upon approval and commercialisation.
Moderna likewise is working on an mRNA flu vaccine and one against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).","vaccine, launches, strain, mrna, virus, technology, vaccines, pfizer, genetic, viruses, flu, trial",Human health crises,pandemic

The company released the results from a sub-study it conducted as part of its late-stage clinical trial of NVX-CoV2373, its protein-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate, in the United Kingdom.
The 431 participants enrolled in the sub-study received an approved seasonal influenza vaccine with about half the participants administered NVX-CoV2373, while the rest received placebo.
The company said vaccine efficacy was 87.5 per cent compared to 89.8 per cent in the main study.
Novavax is also testing its combined flu/Covid-19 vaccine and in May said the combination produced functional antibodies against influenza and the coronavirus in a pre-clinical study.","vaccine, efficacy, substudy, preserved, nvxcov2373, covid19, vaccines, study, results, novavax, receiving, participants, influenza, received",Human health crises,pandemic

Doctors and infectious diseases experts here have been encouraging people to take the flu vaccine even though the number of influenza cases remains low, so as to guard against a possible ""twindemic"" of Covid-19 and the flu.
Locally, the number of influenza cases has remained low, with polyclinics seeing fewer than half the number of patients seeking treatment for acute respiratory infections (ARI) compared with the same period last year.
But among those who had sought treatment for ARI, the number of patients with influenza-like illness was below 5 per cent, and the number of those who tested positive for influenza has remained at zero since June.

23,May-20,"There has been a dramatic drop in the number of people seeing doctors in the past two months for infectious diseases usually transmitted from person to person, with some doctors saying good hygiene and social distancing measures are major factors contributing to the slide.

The biggest fall is in acute upper respiratory infections, which include both influenza and the common cold.

While around 2,500 to 3,000 people a day usually see polyclinic doctors for these ailments, the number had dropped to fewer than 700 by the start of this month, according to Ministry of Health (MOH) figures.

The data also showed similar drops in patient numbers for conditions like diarrhoea, conjunctivitis and hand, foot and mouth disease.

These are diseases spread through human contact coupled with poor personal hygiene.

The trend was also observed by medical group Parkway Shenton.

The Chinese CDC is encouraging the development of vaccines that can prevent all four strains, and it is expected that at least one company on the mainland will be able to produce such vaccines by the fall, he said.

Ms Jiao said research had not found a mutation of the flu virus, which means common medications available on the market are effective.

The commission has asked hospitals to take measures to increase the number of paediatricians on duty to cope with the increasing number of children with flu, she said.

""We have noticed reports that patients in some places cannot get common antiviral drugs for flu from the hospitals, and we will ask hospitals across China that have a shortage of medicines to make emergency purchases of such drugs to ensure adequate supplies,"" Ms Jiao said.

A major hospital in Tianjin has confirmed that it has been forced to close its paediatrics department due to a shortage of doctors.

News of the move by Tianjin Haihe Hospital broke when a netizen posted images online on Jan 7 of a notice pinned to a door leading to the children's clinic.

On Tuesday, the hospital's publicity office confirmed the closure to City Express, a local newspaper, and explained that the move had been taken because its three paediatricians had all gone on sick leave.

Paediatrics has been overwhelmed with patients since the start of the flu season in November (2017), according to the publicity office.

The head of the department took leave last month (December) for an undisclosed reason, leaving two doctors to see about 60 children a day, the hospital said.

Last week, the remaining paediatricians became ill, too, with one having caught the flu bug and the other developing a high fever.

Hospitals have reported record numbers of flu patients this winter, especially paediatrics departments.

The General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University has been receiving 1,000 to 2,000 sick children every day, while doctors at Beijing Children's Hospital saw 10,000 on its busiest day.

China has 118,000 paediatricians and is in need of 200,000 more, according to data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The current ratio is 0.53 doctors to every 1,000 children.

According to the City Express report, the Chinese Medicine Association said the workload for a paediatrician is 1.68 times that of a physician for adult patients, yet their income is substantially lower.

Spring and winter are the peak seasons for flu in China, but few develop into serious cases, said Ms Jiao.

Mr Feng, from the CDC, said it is difficult to prevent flu because it transmits through the air and by physical contact, but vaccines are the best prevention.

""We recommend groups at higher risk, such as children, the elderly and pregnant women, receive vaccines between August and November to prevent flu in the winter,"" he said","Flu outbreak, doctor shortage force China hospital to close its children's clinic",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/flu-outbreak-doctor-shortage-force-childrens-clinic-in-china-to-close,"A major hospital in Tianjin has confirmed that it has been forced to close its paediatrics department due to a shortage of doctors.

With rich countries vaccinating growing proportions of their vulnerable populations, the link between infection numbers and deaths appears to be diminishing.
Now, the focus is on learning to live with the virus and on data that matters most to avoid fresh lockdowns.
If they do, Covid-19 would begin to look less like an unmanageable pandemic and more like a seasonal disease such as influenza.

The viruses in the study were collected primarily from pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics.
Dogs in certain regions of China, like Guangxi, are also raised for meat and street dogs roam freely, creating a more complex ecosystem for canine influenza virus transmission.
Future studies will focus on characterising the virus further and assessing, using human sera, whether humans have existing immunity against canine H1N1 or not.","dogs, potential, jumping, risks, virus, canine, pandemic, h1n1, humans, viruses, study, swine, researchers, influenza, flu, pose",Human health crises,pandemic

Researchers compared data for 89,530 patients hospitalised with Covid-19 in March and April this year with 45,819 patients hospitalised with seasonal influenza between December 2018 and the end of February 2019.
Some 16.9 per cent of Covid-19 patients died during the period of study - which was during a devastating first wave across Europe when doctors had few therapies to turn to for severely ill people.
Researchers found that more patients with Covid-19 needed intensive care - 16.3 per cent compared with 10.8 per cent for influenza - while the average stay in ICU was nearly twice as long (15 days compared to 8 days).

87,Sep-20,"A second wave of virus infection could be breaking over Europe and the situation could turn grim in the coming months, as the northern hemisphere approaches the winter months.

For instance, in Britain, more than 3,000 new cases were reported in 24 hours for the second day in a row last Saturday. France also chalked up 10,000 new infections on Saturday, close to the peak of its first wave in April.

Other countries facing a resurgence include Spain, which became the first Western European nation to record more than 500,000 cases since the start of the outbreak.

Experts in Singapore cautioned that this could be a worrying uptrend.

Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said that though it is unclear if the increased numbers are due to more testing or more cases, it is likely the number of cases will go up with the colder months.

Respiratory viruses thrive in the winter as, among other reasons, people are more likely to gather in crowded indoor environments, facilitating transmission, Prof Tambyah told The Straits Times.

Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice",Europe may face second wave of Covid-19 infections as winter nears,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/europe-may-face-second-wave-of-infections-as-winter-nears,"A second wave of virus infection could be breaking over Europe and the situation could turn grim in the coming months, as the northern hemisphere approaches the winter months.

Next, there is the problem of how to keep people from falling ill, which is linked to vaccinations, he said.
All these are aspects of urban preparedness, he said.
The minister was speaking at an information session on strengthening health emergency preparedness in urban settings, jointly organised by Singapore and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
While the work on preparedness started before Covid-19, the pandemic has magnified the role that urban settings play in health emergencies, Mr Ong said.","preparedness, big, world, whos, ong, health, urban, ye, questions, pandemic, prepares, singapore, kung, work, settings",Human health crises,pandemic
109,Jul-21,I thank Straits Times senior health correspondent Salma Khalik for voicing publicly many of the questions that some of us have been raising privately concerning the Government's response to the developing Covid,Forum: Don't subject economy to repeated Covid-19 curbs,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-dont-subject-economy-to-repeated-covid-19-curbs,"It seems that while Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 talk of pivoting to dealing with the disease as a relatively low-level public health challenge more akin to seasonal influenza, the current measures are more in keeping with pursuing the objective of zero Covid-19.
As in all aspects of life, zero risk is an unattainable dream, and we all have to live with what society deems to be an acceptable level of risk, be it the number of influenza deaths or the number of deaths from road accidents each year.
Yes, the Government does need to have contingency measures (along with appropriate threshold levels to determine when they are needed) in place to deal with potential changes in the threat to public health from new variants.
But the Government cannot subject society and the country's economy to the crude, one-size-fits-all approach of repeated societal restrictions on the route back to normality.

Repeat booster doses every four months could eventually weaken the immune system and tire out people, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
The advice comes as some countries consider the possibility of offering people second booster shots, in a bid to provide further protection against surging Omicron infections.
Earlier this month, Israel became the first nation to start administering a second booster, or fourth shot, to those over 60.
Britain has said that boosters are providing good levels of protection and there is no need for a second booster shot at the moment, but will review data as it evolves.","second, warn, regulators, booster, covid19, agency, vaccines, affect, need, shots, protection, system, eu, frequent, immune, shot, think",Human health crises,pandemic

The mysterious malady, which has afflicted Singapore, Hong Kong and other places in the Far East, has been dubbed Trancazo in Manila, where it is still playing pranks with the population. It has affected every business in the city, and a Manila contemporary says it will probably cost the city untold thousands in lost and slackened business, in expense for medical assistance, and in delay. The transports at the docks could not be worked, only a few of the regular men being available and the extra men refusing to work for less than P1.50 per day, an example of how the disease is costing money.

126,Jan-17,"In contrast, the flu has the potential to be more serious. It can cause severe body ache, extreme lethargy and very high fever with chills. It can also lead to major health complications such as pneumonia or even death.

That is why people who are not well should stay home and not go to work or head to the cinema or other crowded places.

Dr Mark Ng Chung Wai, a senior consultant and chairman of the SingHealth Polyclinics Infection Control & Infectious Diseases workgroup, discusses how we can help prevent the spread of the flu virus.

Q We usually recover from a cold or flu. Why do we have to stay home when we are sick?

A This is about social awareness. If you take the train when you are sick and don't wear a mask, you might infect the people around you.

This is not a big problem if the flu is a mild one. But if there is an elderly person with a chronic illness beside you, things may not turn out well for him.

Q At work, not everyone can or wants to take sick leave when he is unwell. Should this be made a rule?

A I am aware that it is not easy for some people to take sick leave. Some of them may not want to stay at home as they may have deadlines to meet or are concerned about work piling up or burdening colleagues who have to cover their duties. They may also worry that they might be judged as malingering.

Perhaps our work environment expectations need to change, so that taking sick leave when unwell is viewed as legitimate and done in the interests of our colleagues and ourselves.

This is why I emphasise the habit of thoroughly washing your hands.

Q Can we simply wash our hands with water?

A Water alone won't help. You can get rid of debris but not the germs, which can breed in water.

Wash your hands with soap and water. This gets rid of viruses which are picked up when your hands come into contact with contaminated surfaces. Influenza viruses from sick people can survive on surfaces such as tabletops, door knobs and light switches.

Q If water is not available, can we make do with a hand sanitiser?

A Sanitisers are a convenient way of disinfecting your hands, provided they are not visibly soiled. If they are, you should wash them with soap and water instead.

Q Is it safe to eat with our hands after using hand sanitisers?

A Hand sanitisers are typically alcohol",Flu jab protects you and others too,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/flu-jab-protects-you-and-others-too,"A I am aware that it is not easy for some people to take sick leave.

203,Apr-20,"NEW YORK • Does exercise help or hinder one's ability to fight off infections?

In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, that question has gained urgency and, also, thanks to recent research, emergent answers.

The latest science suggests that being fit boosts one's immune system and that even a single workout can amplify and improve one's ability to fight off germs.

But some studies also indicate that the types and amount of exercise may influence how working out affects one's immune responses. More is not necessarily better. And the location of the exercise could matter, too ",Should you be exercising during this period?,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-exercising-during-this-period,"But some studies also indicate that the types and amount of exercise may influence how working out affects one's immune responses.
Many people who exercise have heard from well-meaning friends, spouses or parents that strenuous exercise will tamp down their immune systems, opening them to pathogens and illness.
In remarkable experiments with rodents, scientists marked some of their immune cells with phosphorescent dye and had them run to exhaustion.
After a few hours of sentinel duty, most cells returned to the bloodstream, stabilising immune cells levels there and suggesting that their immune vigilance had refocused, but not declined.

Q Will wearing a mask fully protect me against the virus?

The answer is no. That is not to say that masks are useless. They do help to some degree if used correctly. But the amount of protection varies with the type of mask.

What about putting handkerchief or tissue paper over your mouth and nose when someone nearby coughs and sneezes?

Again, the answer is that this too probably helps to some extent.

215,Jan-20,BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) ,Wuhan virus: China's food markets can be breeding grounds for deadly viruses,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-chinas-food-markets-can-be-breeding-grounds-for-deadly-viruses,"The 60-year-old was shopping at one of China's wet markets, where sales of freshly slaughtered, unpackaged meat have become the focus of an investigation into an outbreak of a potentially deadly lung virus.
The pathogen may have been transmitted to humans from live animals sold there.
Asia's wet markets, where shoppers mingle in narrow spaces with everything from live poultry to snakes, are seen as a key reason why.
Yet the markets, which offer conditions that can set off potentially deadly contagions, remain popular and a central part of life in many cities.
Wet markets are often thronged as fresh meat is procured for the lavish, banquet-style feasts that mark the start of the Chinese New Year.","animals, food, sars, chinese, markets, ran, virus, breeding, live, viruses, wuhan, meat, grounds, deadly, chinas, potentially, wet",Human health crises,pandemic
216,Jan-20,SINGAPORE ,Doctors advise good hygiene as Wuhan virus outbreak develops,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/docs-advise-good-hygiene-as-wuhan-outbreak-develops,"SINGAPORE - As the new coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan continues to develop, potentially spreading further outside of China, health practitioners and experts here advised people to protect themselves by maintaining simple, practical hygiene practices such as washing one's hands often.
Although vaccination against the seasonal influenza does not confer protection, Raffles Medical said people should still get vaccinated, especially if they are planning to travel.
However, infectious disease experts say there was no need to be unduly worried as Singapore is better prepared to handle an outbreak today.
Professor Paul Tambyah, from the department of medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan could be like the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, which quickly spread all over the world.
But in any case, Singapore is even better prepared than in 2009 in terms of testing, equipment and resources.","touching, symptoms, advise, washing, virus, hygiene, spread, good, doctors, singapore, contact, wuhan, medical, develops, ones, outbreak",Human health crises,pandemic
217,Jan-20,"Health practitioners and experts advised people to protect themselves by maintaining simple, practical hygiene practices such as washing one's hands often.

Clinic chain Raffles Medical said human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, and touching one's mouth, nose, or eyes after touching an object or surface with the virus on it, before washing one's hands.

Although vaccination against influenza does not confer protection, Raffles Medical said people should still get vaccinated, especially if they are planning to travel. ""This will prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms and signs that may mislead screening authorities at temperature checkpoints, and result in unnecessary anxiety and delays to your travel,"" it said.

Dr Edwin Chng, medical director of Parkway Shenton, said travellers should avoid contact with live animals and consumption of raw or undercooked meat and avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness.

Infectious disease experts said Singapore is better prepared to handle an outbreak today. Professor Paul Tambyah, from the department of medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said: ""I think that we should be concerned but there are plenty of measures in place to detect cases, isolate and treat them appropriately in Singapore as well as in the other countries in the region.""

Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the programme leader (infectious diseases) at NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said Singapore is far better prepared today than it was during the Sars outbreak 17 years ago, and the impact of the new virus, if it was imported to Singapore, was likely to be negligible. ""China's healthcare system and disease outbreak control capabilities have also improved dramatically since 2003 and I believe they will contain the outbreak.""

Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, advised caution when travelling to China. He said individuals who suspect they might have the virus must come forward to be tested and isolated if necessary.

Congress was formally notified of the proposed sale on Thursday and will have 30 days to review it before it is approved.
Singapore would be the fourth country in the Asia-Pacific region to own F-35 jets, after Australia, Japan and South Korea.
The Army task force would help neutralise some capabilities China and Russia already possess and are intended to keep US carrier groups away from the Asian mainland.

Every year, before the pandemic, about 4,000 patients would die as a result of influenza, viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.
Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Health said there were 4,153 deaths from pneumonia and influenza in 2020.
This compares with 4,442 such deaths in 2019, 4,387 in 2018, 4,216 in 2017 and 3,856 in 2016.
Dr Janil said Singapore is trying hard to avoid ""excess mortality"" due to an inability to provide adequate medical care.","deaths, yearly, spread, spore, result, singapore, vaccination, govt, vaccines, covid19, stem, pneumonia, rate, using, janil, cases, cent",Human health crises,pandemic
