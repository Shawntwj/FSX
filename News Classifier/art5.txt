"Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia," Mr Putin said.
As a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr Putin, a former KGB officer who has declared the Soviet Union's collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.
But the happy brotherhood of nations that Mr Putin likes to paint, with Ukraine fitted snugly into the fabric of a greater Russia, is dubious.
The newly created Soviet government under Lenin that drew so much of Mr Putin's scorn on Monday would eventually crush the nascent independent Ukrainian state.
"For the past few decades, the West has been looking for fascism anywhere, but not where it was most," said Maria Tomak, an activist involved in supporting people from Crimea, a Ukrainian territory Mr Putin annexed in 2014.
