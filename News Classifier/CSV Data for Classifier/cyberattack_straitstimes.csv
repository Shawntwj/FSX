0,22-Feb,KYIV (BLOOMBERG) ,Cyber attack to hit Ukraine worst of its kind in its history,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/cyberattack-to-hit-ukraine-worst-of-its-kind-in-its-history,"KYIV (BLOOMBERG) - A cyber attack aimed at paralysing banks and government websites was the worst of its kind in Ukrainian history, officials in Kyiv said, as the standoff with Russia continues to draw warnings of a potential invasion.
In the past, Ukraine's Security Service has said hacking groups linked to Russian intelligence services may have been responsible for similar attacks, allegations Moscow has denied.
Russia, which annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supports separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, says it has no plans to invade.
This year, hackers defaced Ukrainian government websites in January, broadcasting a message that falsely claimed to have stolen private data from citizens.
Russia ""had nothing to do"" with this week's cyberattack in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.","russia, cyber, services, history, ukraines, websites, worst, country, ukraine, security, service, attack, hit, kind, ukrainian",cyberattack,cyberattack

""Russia likes to move in the shadows and counts on a long process of attribution,"" Neuberger said.
""In light of that, we're moving quickly to attribute the DDoS attacks.
We believe the Russian government is responsible for widespread attacks on Ukrainian banks this week.""

2,22-Feb,KYIV/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (REUTERS) ,Ukraine hit by cyber attack as US questions Russian troop pullback,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-hit-by-cyber-attack-as-us-questions-russian-troop-pullback,"KYIV/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - Kyiv appeared to blame Russia for a cyber attack on Tuesday (Feb 15) as US President Joe Biden warned that more than 150,000 Russian troops were still amassed near Ukraine’s borders after Moscow’s announcement of a partial pullback was met with scepticism.
On Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry published footage to demonstrate it was returning some troops to base after exercises.
“Our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position.”Hours after Moscow’s announcement, Ukraine said the online networks of its defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed in what is called a distributed denial-of-service.
The manoeuvre works when hackers flood a network with unusually high volumes of data traffic to paralyse it.

4,22-Feb,TOKYO (REUTERS) ,Japan eyes tighter curbs to counter cyber attacks,https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/japan-eyes-tighter-curbs-to-counter-cyber-attacks,"TOKYO (REUTERS) - Japan will consider imposing tighter curbs on companies in security-sensitive sectors that procure overseas software as part of efforts to ramp up steps to counter cyber attacks, according to a proposal by a key panel released on Tuesday (Feb 1).
The move would be part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's initiative to defend Japan's economic security mainly against China, such as by preventing leaks of sensitive technology and building more resilient supply chains.
""Due to rapid digitalisation in today's world, almost all areas of economic activity including those involving critical infrastructure are targets of cyber attacks,"" the panel said, in explaining the need for fresh legislation.
Advanced economies, including the United States and Japan, have faced several major cyber attacks recently including those with ties to Russia and China.
Japan is under pressure to follow in the footsteps of the US in boosting counter-measures against cyber attacks and compete with Beijing's growing push to export sensitive technologies such as commercial drones and security cameras.","cyber, proposal, economic, companies, attacks, tokyo, eyes, including, panel, japan, tighter, counter, security, curbs",cyberattack,cyberattack

Ukraine has often been President Vladimir Putin's testing ground for Russia's arsenal of cyberweapons.
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about American assessments of Mr Putin's next moves.
When the White House tried to explain what Mr Biden meant when he questioned how the West would respond to a ""minor incursion"" into Ukrainian territory, White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested in a statement that he had ""cyber attacks and paramilitary tactics"" in mind, which fall short of traditional military attacks.","sends, cyber, russian, attacks, official, ukraine, nato, help, house, sanctions, security, weeks, white, brace",cyberattack,cyberattack

Researchers from Cyfirma, a cyber intelligence firm, said it had uncovered how Chinese hacking group APT10 had been targeting the IT infrastructure and supply chain of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine, and Bharat Biotech, the local vaccine maker.
Cyfirma said it found that India's vaccine research had attracted the attention of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors ""whose intentions are to tarnish India's reputation as well as to disrupt her national vaccination effort"".
""State-sponsored hackers are making inroads to disrupt vaccine distribution, steal research intellectual property, all in their efforts to create a competitive advantage for their countries.""

Participants should also respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and data policies of other member nations, while not requesting individual data without their permission.

Mr Wang also said participants would take ""actions to prevent and put an end to activities that infringe upon personal information, oppose abusing infocomm technology to conduct mass surveillance against other states or engage in unauthorised collection of personal information"".

The hacker implanted malware that evaded the agency's protection system and was able to gain access to the network by using valid access credentials for multiple users' Microsoft 365 accounts and domain administrator accounts, according to authorities.
Investigators were not able to determine how the hacker initially obtained the credentials.
But the agency said it was possible that the hacker obtained them by exploiting a known vulnerability in Pulse Secure virtual private network servers.

3 Enable two-factor authenticationTurn on two-factor authentication - an extra layer of identity verification through a one-time password or biometric authentication - to secure your online accounts.
For instance, users must use a physical security token - on top of a password - to sign in to their Google accounts.

Many insurance companies sell cyber coverage, but the policies are often written narrowly to cover costs related to the loss of customer data, such as helping a company provide credit checks or cover legal bills.

Mondelez argued that its property insurance package should cover the losses from the NotPetya attack. In court filings, Mondelez said its policy had been updated in 2016 to include losses caused by ""the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction"".

The company lost 1,700 servers and 24,000 laptops. Employees were left to communicate through WhatsApp and executives posted updates on Yammer, a social network used by companies.

Damage from NotPetya spread all the way to Hobart, Tasmania, where computers in a Cadbury factory displayed ransomware messages that demanded US$300 in bitcoin.

Courts often rule against insurers that try to apply the wartime exemption.

After hijackers destroyed a Pan Am airliner in 1970, a US court rejected insurer Aetna's attempt, determining that the action was criminal and not an act of war.

In 1983, a judge ruled that Holiday Inn's insurance policy covered damage from the civil war in Lebanon.

In the Mondelez and Merck lawsuits, the central question is whether the government's attribution of the NotPetya attack to Russia meets the bar for the war exclusion.

Risk industry experts say cyberwar is still largely undefined. Attribution can be difficult when attacks come from groups with unofficial links to a state and the blamed government denies involvement.

Mr Zafrir said leaders in organisations have to view cyber security as their responsibility and make decisions at the top level to keep online attackers at bay.

He added that key decision makers need to factor in cyber security because it presents a big threat to any organisation by having the potential to disrupt it so much that it would cease to function.

""There aren't many things that can bring a company to its knees like a cyber attack can. And a cyber attack has a crippling effect, because of the complexity of the networks in a world where everything is connected,"" said Mr Zafrir.

Mr Alexander and Mr Zafrir had worked in the US and Israeli militaries respectively before crossing over to the digital realm to work on fortifying defences online.

Mr Alexander was the former US National Security Agency director while Mr Zafrir was a former commander of an intelligence unit in the Israel Defence Forces.

When asked how his prior experience helped him prepare for his current work, Mr Zafrir said the sense of urgency and the importance of working with the right people was the same in both fields.

The two experts also weighed in on the Government's response to the data breach in SingHealth, where hackers stole the data of 1.5 million patients and the outpatient prescription details of 160,000 people, including those of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

A Committee of Inquiry (COI) set up to look into the attack recommended various measures to beef up cyber security, such as improving incident response processes, using automation to roll out security patches and introducing tiered Internet access in the healthcare sector.

Mr Alexander, who was an expert witness for the COI and gave his expert opinion on Nov 12 last year, said the COI's investigations made clear the threat that online attackers pose. It also reflected how the Government prioritised cyber security.

""It says to the people of Singapore that the Government is not going to stand by idly when these things happen, which I think is exactly the right thing to do,"" he added.

While he also applauded the actions Singapore took following the SingHealth data breach, Mr Zafrir said one should expect to see more such cyber breaches hunting for data that are ""personally identifiable information"".

He said: ""We will probably see more of these attacks because if data is the new gold, then criminals, nation states and others will go after data.",Use behavioural analytics and leadership oversight to bolster cyber defence: Experts,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/use-behavioural-analytics-and-leadership-oversight-to-bolster-cyber-defence-experts,"Mr Zafrir said leaders in organisations have to view cyber security as their responsibility and make decisions at the top level to keep online attackers at bay.

The personal information of ministers and other very important people will also be kept in separate systems with more stringent protection.
The technical measures announced on Monday (July 15) are the first of more to come from a new Public Sector Data Security Review Committee, which was convened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in April this year.
They were issued after a government-wide stocktake of how data was managed at five key agencies here handling medical and financial data of citizens.
The 13 measures conform to a common definition of what is entailed for sensitive information as outlined in the new Information Sensitivity Framework, and will replace the current practices by public agencies, many of which devised the practices themselves.","following, information, citizens, singapore, measures, protect, sensitive, public, breaches, practices, security, service, roll, separate, data, personal",cyberattack,cyberattack

The comments came in a report prepared by EU countries on cyber-security risks to 5G networks, seen as crucial to the bloc's economic growth.
While the report does not name any country or company, observers have frequently cited China and the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, Huawei Technologies, as potential threats.
""Among the various potential actors, non-EU states or state-backed are considered as the most serious ones and the most likely to target 5G networks,"" the European Commission and Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a joint statement.

None of the sources who spoke to AFP could formally identify the perpetrators of the attacks, pointing to the extreme difficulty in obtaining evidence and identification.

These are aimed at enhancing responses to similar incidents, better protecting SingHealth's database against similar attacks and reducing the risk of such cyber attacks on public sector IT systems with large databases of personal data. They are grouped into two categories: seven priority recommendations and nine additional recommendations.

PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

1 An enhanced security structure and readiness must be adopted by the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) and public health institutions.

Cyber security has to be seen as a risk management issue, and not just a technical issue, where decisions are made at the appropriate management level.

IHiS, Singapore's central IT agency for the healthcare sector, has to take an approach where security is not dependent on just one line of defence.

Gaps between policy and practice must be addressed.

2 Online security processes must be reviewed to assess their ability to defend and respond to advanced threats.

Effectiveness of current processes must be reviewed to fill gaps used by the attacker.

3 Staff awareness on cyber security must be improved, to better prevent, detect and respond to security incidents.

The level of cyber hygiene among users must improve.

A security awareness programme should be implemented to reduce organisational risk.

IT staff must be equipped with sufficient knowledge to recognise the signs of a security incident.

4 Enhanced security checks must be performed, especially on critical information infrastructure (CII) systems.

Vulnerability assessments, safety reviews and certification of vendor products must be done.

5 Privileged administrator accounts must be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring.

An inventory of administrative accounts should be created to keep track of them.

All administrators must use two",COI on SingHealth cyber attack: 16 recommendations,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/16-recommendations,"In addition to the five key findings on the SingHealth data breach, the Committee of Inquiry that investigated Singapore's worst cyber attack made 16 recommendations.

464,18-Aug,"BERLIN • Germany has announced a new agency to fund research on cyber security and to end its reliance on digital technologies from the United States, China and other countries.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told reporters that Germany needed new tools to become a top player in cyber security and shore up European security and independence.

""It is our joint goal for Germany to take a leading role in cyber security on an international level,"" Mr Seehofer told a news conference with Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday.

""We have to acknowledge we're lagging behind, and when one is lagging, one needs completely new approaches.""

The agency is a joint interior and defence ministry project.

Germany, like many other countries, faces a daily barrage of cyber attacks on its government and industry computer networks.

However, the opposition Greens criticised the project. ""This agency wouldn't increase our information technology security, but further endanger it,"" said Greens lawmaker Konstantin von Notz.

The agency's work on offensive capabilities would undermine Germany's diplomatic efforts to limit the use of cyber weapons internationally, he said.

""As a state based on the rule of law, we can only lose a cyber politics arms race with states like China, North Korea or Russia,"" he added, calling for ""scarce resources"" to be focused on hardening vulnerable systems.

Germany and other European countries also worry about their dependence on US technologies.

This follows revelations in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of extensive surveillance by the US.

The US Patriot Act, which was signed into law in 2001, also gave the US government broad powers to compel companies to provide data.

""As a federal government, we cannot stand idly by when the use of sensitive technology with high security relevance are controlled by other governments. We must secure and expand such key technologies of our digital infrastructure,"" Mr Seehofer said.

The decision by the United States to publicly attribute hacking attempts of American critical infrastructure was ""unprecedented and extraordinary,"" said Amit Yoran, a former US official who founded DHS's Computer Emergency Response Team.

""I have never seen anything like this,"" said Yoran, now chief executive of the cyber firm Tenable, said.

A White House National Security Council spokesman did not respond when asked what specifically prompted the public blaming of Russia. US officials have historically been reluctant to call out such activity in part because the United States also spies on infrastructure in other parts of the world.

News of the hacking campaign targeting US power companies first surfaced in June in a confidential alert to industry that described attacks on industrial firms, including nuclear plants, but did not attribute blame.

""People sort of suspected Russia was behind it, but today's statement from the U.S. government carries a lot of weight,""said Ben Read, manager for cyber espionage analysis with cyber security company FireEye Inc.

ENGINEERS TARGETED

The campaign targeted engineers and technical staff with access to industrial controls, suggesting the hackers were interested in disrupting operations, though FireEye has seen no evidence that they actually took that step, Read said.

A former senior DHS official familiar with the government response to the campaign said that Russia's targeting of infrastructure networks dropped off after the publication in the fall of Symantec's research and an October government alert, which detailed technical forensics about the hacking attempts but did not name Russia.

The official declined to say whether the campaign was still ongoing or provide specifics on which targets were breached, or how close hackers may have gotten to operational control systems.

""We did not see them cross into the control networks,"" DHS cyber security official Rick Driggers told reporters at a dinner on Thursday evening.

Driggers said he was unaware of any cases of control networks being compromised in the United States and that the breaches were limited to business networks. But, he added, ""We know that there is intent there.""

It was not clear what Russia's motive was. Many cyber security experts and former US officials say such behaviour is generally espionage","In a first, US blames Russia for cyber attacks on energy grid",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/in-a-first-us-blames-russia-for-cyber-attacks-on-energy-grid,"""People sort of suspected Russia was behind it, but today's statement from the U.S. government carries a lot of weight,""said Ben Read, manager for cyber espionage analysis with cyber security company FireEye Inc.

Demanding that companies in charge of important infrastructure, such as electricity and railway networks, find secure cloud services, the government wants to strengthen defences against cyber attacks from China and other nations, the sources said.
An increasing number of companies are adopting cloud storage services as an efficient means of data management that saves the time and effort that in-house information systems require.
However, unsecured cloud systems are vulnerable to data leaks from cyber attacks.

For example, information sharing, which is one of the most fundamental cyber defence strategies, is often an area which is very difficult to implement.

It added that those who can justify the need for these connections should ensure better protection, such as by using uni-directional data diodes or secured two-way informational gateways.
A uni-directional gateway is a network appliance allowing data to travel in only one direction, to guarantee information security.
This can be done by a variety of means, such as encryption and content inspection, to protect the network path to the system.

The country's primitive infrastructure is far less vulnerable to cyber retaliation, and North Korean hackers operate outside the country, anyway.
Seven months later, during joint military exercises between US and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea's two largest broadcasters.
Like Iran's Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyse their business operations.","korea, experts, world, cyber, attacks, laughed, power, sitting, intelligence, hackers, mr, nuclear, north, south, korean",cyberattack,cyberattack

Chinese authorities have repeatedly denied claims by Western cyber security firms that it supports hacking.
Homeland Security released the information to support US companies in responding to attacks by the group, which is targeting information technology, energy, healthcare, communications and manufacturing firms.
The reported increase in Chinese hacking follows what cybersecurity firms have described as a lull in such attacks prompted by a 2015 agreement between Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Barrack Obama to curb cyber-enabled economic theft.

There have been four major attacks on Airbus in the last 12 months, according to two security sources involved in investigating the hacking.
Mr Romain Bottan of the aerospace security specialist BoostAerospace said the attacks showed that hackers were seeking out weak links in the chain to compromise Airbus's systems.
Several sources said they believed a group of hackers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, known as APT10, could be behind the attacks.
There is also a major industrial risk for Airbus, with hackers potentially able to knock out production for strategic suppliers, which would have a knock-on effect on production.","cyber, suppliers, attacks, series, hackers, sources, aerospace, security, group, commercial, chinese, airbus, hit, afp",cyberattack,cyberattack

Some policymakers and managers are taking notice around the world. In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security, the chief federal agency dealing with cyber security, has highlighted businesses' ""shared responsibility"" to protect themselves against cyber attacks.

527,17-Jul,"First, CII is defined in Section 2 of the Bill as ""a computer or a computer system that is necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services which Singapore relies on"". While the essential services are listed in the First Schedule, the organisations that serve the essential services can come from any other sector.

For example, if a company provides printing services for healthcare institutions, then its computers or computer systems could be ""necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services"". Likewise, many of the significant organisations in the 11 sectors rely on a wide range of suppliers and service providers for their daily operations. The computers of some of those suppliers and service providers could in turn fall within this definition.

Even where suppliers and service providers are not designated as CII, their CII customers may impose contractual requirements on them, to support their CII obligations. For example, if the CII owner needs to report attacks, carry out audits and risk assessments, then the CII owner will also want its suppliers to do the same.

Professor Kenneth Kwek, SingHealth's deputy group chief executive (organisational transformation and informatics), who also took the stand on Monday, spoke about the need to deepen all employee's understanding of cyber safety.
Among other things, he said more town halls will be held to provide information on new cyber-security and ransomware threats.
Since 2016, employees logging into the network have been greeted by a message on their computers reminding them of the importance of data protection.","cyber, patients, healthcare, cybersecurity, coi, data, network, awareness, contact, message, group, deepen, employees, attack, singhealth",cyberattack,cyberattack

There, likely plugged into computers by unsuspecting engineers, the worm wreaked havoc, taking control of the uranium centrifuges and causing them to spin themselves to failure.

The use of the worm, which was reportedly developed by the United States and Israel, is widely regarded by cyber security experts as one of the first cyber attacks carried out by nation states. A documentary was even made about Stuxnet, called Zero Days, and it was screened in Singapore last year.

There have been other attacks since the one using Stuxnet in 2010. Last December the capital of Ukraine suffered a blackout for over an hour after cyber attackers hacked into the utility company and took power offline.

595,19-Jul,"Mr Frank Cilluffo, head of Auburn University's Centre for Cyber and Homeland Security, said the attacks have reached epidemic levels.

""The scale and scope of the problem is striking, affecting everywhere from relatively robust states to major metropolitan areas to smaller cities and counties,"" Mr Cilluffo told a congressional hearing last month.

""Targets include police and sheriff departments, schools and libraries, health agencies, transit systems, and courts...no jurisdiction is too small or too large to go unaffected.""

Ransomware has been a thorny cybersecurity issue for several years in the US and globally, marked by global ransomware attacks known as ""WannaCry"" and ""NotPetya"".

Health care institutions have been frequent victims, and Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre revealed in 2016 it paid US$17,000 to hackers to decrypt important data.

The French Interior Ministry said in a recent report that authorities responded to some 560 ransomware incidents in 2018 but also noted that most incidents are unreported.

The same ministry report said hackers have shifted their strategy from attacking many systems with demands for small ransoms to more targeted attacks with higher potential payout.

While the FBI and others warn against paying ransoms, some analysts say there is no clear answer for victims when critical data is locked.

""You have to do what's right for your organisation,"" Mr Falco said. ""It's not the FBI's call. You might have criminal justice information, you could have decades of evidence. You have to weigh this for yourself.""

Mr Josh Zelonis at Forrester Research offered a similar view, saying in a blog post that victims need to consider paying the ransom as a valid option, alongside other recovery efforts.

But Mr Randy Marchany, chief information security officer for Virginia Tech University, said the best answer is to take a hardline ""don't pay"" attitude.

""I don't agree with any organisation or city paying the ransom,"" Mr Marchany said.

""The victims will have to rebuild their infrastructure from scratch anyway. If you pay the ransom, the hackers give you the decryption key but you have no assurance the ransomware has been removed from all of your systems. So, you have to rebuild them anyway.""

Victims often fail to take preventive measures such as software updates and data backups that would limit the impact of ransomware.

But victims may not always be aware of potential remedies that do not involve paying up, said Mr Brett Callow of Emsisoft, one of several security firms that offer free decryption tools.

""If the encryption in ransomware is implemented properly, there is a zero chance of recovery unless you pay the ransom,"" Mr Callow said.

""Often it isn't implemented properly, and we find weaknesses in the encryption and undo it.""

Mr Callow also points to coordinated efforts of security firms including the No More Ransom Project, which partners with Europol, and ID Ransomware, which can identify some malware and sometimes unlock data.

Analysts point out that ransomware attacks may be motivated by more than just money. Two Iranians were charged last year in the attack on Atlanta that prosecutors said was an attempt to disrupt US institutions.

""Attackers which aren't such big fans of the US might want to cause economic disruption,"" Mr Falco said.

""Instead of trying to take down the whole electric grid, they may try to create chaos in a number of cities.","As ransomware rages, debate heats up on response to hacker demands",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/as-ransomware-rages-debate-heats-up-on-response-to-hacker-demands,"Mr Frank Cilluffo, head of Auburn University's Centre for Cyber and Homeland Security, said the attacks have reached epidemic levels.

615,17-Oct,"WASHINGTON • Early in his administration, President Donald Trump signed a directive outlining a strategy of pressure against North Korea that involved actions across a broad spectrum of government agencies, and led to the use of military cyber capabilities, according to US officials.

As part of the campaign, the US Cyber Command targeted hackers in North Korea's military spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, by barraging their computer servers with traffic that choked off Internet access.

Mr Trump's directive, a senior administration official said, included instructions to diplomats and officials to bring up North Korea in nearly every conversation with foreign interlocutors and urge them to sever all ties with Pyongyang.

Those conversations have had significant success, particularly in recent weeks as North Korea has tested another nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, officials said. So pervasive is the diplomatic campaign that some governments have found themselves scrambling to find any ties with North Korea.

Smith said the steps were taken after consultation with several governments, which he did not identify, but Microsoft's decision was independent.

The WannaCry attack was ""meant to cause havoc and destruction,"" Bossert said. He conceded there was little the United States could do to exert further pressure on Pyongyang.

""We don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour,"" Bossert said. ""It's nevertheless important to call them out, to let them know that it's them and we know it's them.""

Britain and several private sector security researchers previously concluded that North Korea was responsible for the attack. Bossert said other countries including Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also agreed with the US conclusion.

A senior administration official told Reuters on Monday that US intelligence agencies had a ""very high level of confidence"" that the Lazarus Group carried out the WannaCry attack. Classified sources and methods were used to make that determination, the official said.

Lazarus is widely believed by security researchers and US officials to have been responsible for the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment that destroyed files, leaked corporate communications online and led to the departure of several top executives.

North Korean government representatives could not be reached immediately for comment. Pyongyang has denied responsibility for WannaCry and called other allegations that it launched cyber attacks a smear campaign.

The United States did not issue any indictments or name individuals believed to be involved in the attacks.

Worries are mounting in Washington about North Korea's hacking capabilities and its weapons programmes. North Korea this month said it had successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that could place the entire US mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.

676,17-Apr,"BERLIN • Germany's armed forces were yesterday set to launch a new cyber command, with a status equal to that of the army, navy and air force, meant to shield its information technology (IT) and weapons systems from attacks.

Military planners fear that wars of the future will start with cyber attacks against critical infrastructure and networks, extensive online espionage and sabotage.

The Bundeswehr's new Cyber and Information Space Command, based in the former West German capital of Bonn, will start with 260 IT specialists but grow to 13,500 military and civilian personnel by July.

The German government has been sensitised to cyber security since its Parliament was attacked last year, with security sources suspecting Russian hackers as being responsible.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced the creation of the cyber command two years ago to protect the military from an increasing number of online attacks.
The German Parliament was the target of fresh cyber attacks in January that attempted to piggyback on an Israeli newspaper website in order to target politicians in Germany, Berlin's cyber security watchdog said last Wednesday.

Mr Chang said ransomware, where cyber attackers digitally ""lock out"" data and hold it for ransom, is the leading cyber threat for SMEs.
His advice was that companies practise good cyber security hygiene such as using genuine software and regularly upgrading security patches on computers.

""The money will pay for resources, expertise and training so that we will be equipped to drive and take ownership of the cyber security agenda in our respective countries,"" he said.

Second, Dr Yaacob urged Asean members to tap into global efforts to build a trusted cyberspace, such as through international law enforcement efforts like the Interpol Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) that is based in Singapore.

""Countries have to actively support the IGCI for its continued success and effectiveness,"" he said.

""We can support the IGCI by seconding more Asean law enforcement officers to the IGCI. By partnering Interpol, we can conduct more joint operations against cyber criminals and enhance the collective safety and security of Asean.""

Singapore will also contribute $900,000 to the CyberGreen global initiative that provides tools for a country to measure its level of cyber health, announced Dr Yaacob.

With this sponsorship, all Asean member countries will be able to access the CyberGreen platform through Singapore for free and be able to better identify different levels of threats and ways to counter them.

Third, Asean has to start a dialogue on cyber norms, and work towards developing a set of regional cyber norms.

735,18-Jul,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday assured Singaporeans there is nothing alarming in his outpatient medication data that was stolen by hackers.

He was among 160,000 patients who had information of their outpatient prescriptions pilfered from SingHealth's database, in the most serious data breach in Singapore's history. In all, the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients were compromised.

In a Facebook post, PM Lee noted that those behind the cyber attacks ""specifically and repeatedly"" targeted his medication data.

""I don't know what the attackers were hoping to find. Perhaps they were hunting for some dark state secret, or at least something to embarrass me,"" he wrote. ""If so, they would have been disappointed. My medication data is not something I would ordinarily tell people about, but there is nothing alarming in it.""

PM Lee said SingHealth had asked him whether to computerise his personal records when digitising its medical records, or to keep them in hard copy for security reasons.

The Prime Minister said he asked to be included, as going digital would enable his doctors to treat him more effectively and in a timely manner.

""I was confident that SingHealth would do their best to protect my patient information, just as it did for all their other patients in the database,"" he said.

But PM Lee added that he also knew the database would be attacked, and that there was a risk it might be compromised one day. Unfortunately, that has now happened, he said.

He stressed that the security and confidentiality of patient information is a top priority, and said he has ordered the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group to work with the Ministry of Health to tighten cyber defences and processes across the board.

744,17-Oct,SEOUL • A state,Pyongyang gets Internet boost from Russian firm,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/pyongyang-gets-internet-boost-from-russian-firm,"SEOUL • A state-owned Russian company has opened up a second Internet connection for North Korea, which could strengthen Pyongyang's cyber capabilities and undermine American efforts to isolate the regime, security experts said.
The activation of the new line from TransTeleCom was first detected on Sunday by analysts at Dyn Research, which monitors global Internet connectivity.
The new link supplements the existing one provided by China Unicom, which has almost exclusively routed North Korean Internet traffic since 2010.
It gives Pyongyang ""significantly more resilience against attacks on their network infrastructure"", said Mr Bryce Boland, the chief technology officer in the Asia-Pacific for cyber-security firm FireEye.
The Washington Post reported earlier that the United States Cyber Command had carried out attacks against hackers in North Korea aimed at cutting off their access to the Internet.","korea, cyber, russian, attacks, gets, united, undermine, pyongyang, firm, boost, north, internet, washington, unicom, unit",cyberattack,cyberattack

And in the search for the criminals, investigators are following much the same process that detectives have used for decades: Secure the crime scene, collect forensic evidence and try to trace the clues back to the perpetrator.

But for all of their similarities to traditional crimes, cyber attacks have major digital twists that can make them much harder to solve and can greatly magnify the damage.

Such a large, complex and global crime outbreak means any hope of a successful investigation will require close teamwork among international law enforcement agencies ",Old-world sleuthing to solve digital crime,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/old-world-sleuthing-to-solve-digital-crime,"""Catching who did this is going to be very hard, and will require a level of international cooperation from law enforcement that does not come naturally.""
As with a crime scene, the first step with a cyber investigation is to make sure the criminal is no longer hiding, about to pounce again.
That includes working with law enforcement to uncover clues left behind by the attackers, as well as tracking the virus and its effects separately to protect their corporate clients.
Success often depends on whether law enforcement can tie small details, including potential mistakes or a style in the programming code, back to the criminals.

771,17-Apr,"StarHub received a warning from the authorities yesterday for two disruptions to its home broadband network in October last year, which investigation findings now show were not due to direct cyber attacks as the telco had suspected.

Findings released yesterday by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) show that StarHub did not have sufficient system capacity to cope with an Internet traffic surge.

The telco has since increased its capacity, said IMDA and CSA.

IMDA also directed StarHub to do an independent review of its infrastructure, saying it ""will not hesitate to take sterner action should a similar incident happen in future"".

The two disruptions came on the heels of a cyber attack the week before on United States-based DNS service provider Dyn.
However, the traffic surge on StarHub's network was indirectly linked to Dyn, said IMDA and CSA.

""The cyber attacks we are seeing are increasing in their frequency, their severity and their sophistication,"" Mr Hammond said at the official opening.
Part of Britain's communications spying agency GCHQ, the London hub is aimed at implementing preventive measures such as better securing state websites and e-mail accounts.
Cyber attacks on government departments seek information on policy, including energy and diplomacy, while state-sponsored attacks on companies can be aimed at stealing intellectual property, Mr Martin added.","threat, cyber, targets, hub, russian, uk, attacks, philip, london, martin, opening, mr, ncsc, security",cyberattack,cyberattack

The authorities confirmed the telco's own customers had partly contributed to the surge in Internet traffic that overwhelmed StarHub's systems, with IMDA directing StarHub to conduct an independent review of its infrastructure.
Another contributing factor was recovery action taken by service providers in the United States following a cyber attack there.
Its Telecom Service Resiliency Code spells out the minimum requirements for service availability.
Breaching these requirements - such as a loss of 70 per cent or more of a telco's Internet bandwidth - may result in a fine ranging from $15,000 to $270,000 for every 30 minutes of outage.","rule, cyber, cause, singapore, telco, 2016, authorities, starhubs, requirements, telcos, network, disruption, broadband, service, internet, attack, imda",cyberattack,cyberattack

The discovery may stoke fears about cyber vulnerabilities in power grids that have intensified in the wake of the December Ukraine attack, and one a year earlier that also cut power in that nation.
The sample of Crash Override that was analysed by Dragos is capable of attacking power operators across Europe, according to Lee.
Reuters reviewed an ESET technical analysis of the malware provided by the security firm, which they planned to release publicly on Monday (June 12).

The newly disclosed heists across Europe follow the hacking of ATMs in Taiwan and Thailand that were widely reported over the summer.
Although cyber criminals have been attacking cash machines for at least five years, the early campaigns mostly involved small numbers of ATMs because hackers needed to have physical access to cash out machines.
Indeed, Dmitry Volkov, head of threat intelligence with Group IB, told Reuters he expects more heists on ATMs.
Group IB said it believed the attacks across Europe were conducted by a single criminal group, which it dubbed Cobalt.","threat, cyber, heists, europe, attacks, machines, hackers, banks, atm, cash, atms, group, grows, target, bank",cyberattack,cyberattack

902,17-Mar,"Four key amendments to Singapore's laws were tabled in the House yesterday to keep up with cybercrime's changing and increasingly transnational nature.

The Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill seeks to criminalise the act of dealing and trading in personal information, such as credit card details for nefarious purposes, even though the trader may not have hacked into computers to obtain it.

The buying and selling of hacking tools, such as malware and port scanners from online marketplaces, will be an offence if the intention is criminal, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in a statement.

If the amendments are passed, it will also criminalise offences under the existing Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act which are committed abroad, against an overseas computer.

""This amendment makes this an offence... if the act causes or creates a significant risk of serious harm in Singapore,"" said MHA.

Serious harm includes illness, injury or death, and disruptions to essential services, national security and Singapore's foreign relations.

Essential services include energy, water, finance, government, healthcare, information communication and transportation.

Examples of offences include releasing to the public people's bank account details, hospital patients' medical records or confidential government documents.

A new Section 11A also proposes to allow, among other things, multiple unauthorised access to one computer, for a period of 12 months or less, to be combined under a single charge. A perpetrator may do this to prepare for a cyber attack on the system.

Combining the multiple acts into a single criminal charge will allow for damage caused to be aggregated, so that a heavier penalty under a specified section can be imposed.

The maximum penalty under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act varies, depending on the crime, from a $5,000 fine and two years' jail, to a $100,000 fine and 20 years' jail.

The warning comes on the heels of the ""WannaCry"" cyberattack, which has hit hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.
While no UIWIX infections have yet been detected in China, the virus has spread in other countries and prompted a security alert last week from the Danish cybersecurity company Heimdal Security.
Larson said China is particularly vulnerable to malicious code because the majority of the country's computer users are reliant on pirated software.

The source of this week's attacks was unknown, however, and neither of the two Russian banks, nor Kaspersky, linked them to Biden's comments.
Kaspersky said Russian banks were regularly subject to DDoS attacks, in which those conducting the attack flood the target with junk Internet traffic to disrupt its computer systems.

A display screen at an Orchard Central Desigual outlet is also believed to have been hit by the ransomware attack.
Friday's attack used a piece of malicious software known as ""WanaCrypt0r 2.0"" or WannaCry that exploits a vulnerability in Windows.

The latest arrest was a 30-year-old man who was detained in the central city of Birmingham on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts, London's Metropolitan Police said.
The arrest came as the government confirmed that Masood had used the WhatsApp messaging service, saying it was crucial that the security services be allowed to access the heavily-encrypted app.
Media reports said Masood used the Facebook-owned service just minutes before staging his assault, although it was unclear whether he sent any messages or just looked at the app.
Speaking to Sky News, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was ""completely unacceptable"" that police and security services had not been able to crack the heavily-encrypted service.","masood, attacks, terrorists, birmingham, eyes, london, arrest, used, extremist, clues, security, service, whatsapp, attack, heavilyencrypted",cyberattack,cyberattack

She is on the list of people targeted by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russia's malfeasance, including efforts to influence the 2016 US elections.

On what appears to be her personal website, Ms Alisa Shevchenko introduces herself and expounds on some of her digital accomplishments, including setting up a workspace for hackers in Moscow.

The White House identified the company Ms Shevchenko founded, Zor Security, as a supplier to the Russian military's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), said to be behind the hacking attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organisations. The US government said the company provided technical support to the GRU for the attacks.

Ms Shevchenko had been a minor celebrity in Moscow computer industry circles as a ""legal"" hacker. The Russian edition of Forbes in 2014 described her business as discovering security flaws in the software of banks and other institutions.

Praised as a young talent by the Russian news media in 2005, when she was just 21, Ms Shevchenko worked on cyber defence projects but embraced the symbols and parlance of criminal hackers.

She often posts on Twitter under the handle ""badd1e"". In a flurry of tweets last Friday, she mocked a US sanctioning agency, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, with a vulgarism, and said she had closed Zor Security.

While Kronos is one of many widely used forms of banking Trojans, Hutchins is accused of being a supplier, and not actually hacking people's computers to install the malware.
The arrest appears linked to the FBI's shutdown of a notorious online criminal marketplace called AlphaBay, where Hutchins is accused of selling the Kronos malware.
On Thursday, three bitcoin wallets linked to the malware were emptied out, with the tokens divided into smaller amounts and sent to other bitcoin addresses.","cyber, wallets, kronos, banking, malware, charged, software, marcus, arrest, hero, hacker, hutchins, used, creating, wannacry, attack, thousands",cyberattack,cyberattack

1076,17-Jun,"Kaspersky reported that approximately 2,000 computer systems had been affected by the new ransomware so far.

Symantec, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm, confirmed that the ransomware was infecting computers through at least one exploit, or vulnerability to computer systems, known as Eternal Blue.

Eternal Blue was leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers, who have previously released hacking tools used by the National Security Agency. The same vulnerability was used in May to spread the WannaCry ransomware, in which hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries were affected.

Photographs and videos of computers affected by the attack show a message of red text over a black screen. The message read: ""Oops, your important files have been encrypted. If you see this text then your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking to recover your files but don't waste your time.""

Several cybersecurity researchers have identified a Bitcoin address to which the attackers are demanding a payment of US$300 (S$415) from their victims. At least some of the victims appear to be paying the ransom.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

Who is behind the ransomware attack. The original Petya ransomware was developed and used by cybercriminals, and variations have been sold through dark web trading sites, which are accessible only by using browsers that mask a user's identity, making it difficult for cybersecurity researchers to track.

Why it is spreading as quickly as it is.

In laboratory testing, researchers at MWR and Kyptos say they have found Windows XP crashes before the virus can spread.
Microsoft has faced criticism since 2014 for withdrawing support for older versions of Windows software such as 16-year-old Windows XP and requiring users to pay hefty annual fees instead.
While encrypting individual computers it infects, WannaCry code does not attack network data-backup systems, as more sophisticated ransomware packages typically do, security experts who have studied WannaCry code agree.

The researcher, tweeting as @MalwareTechBlog, said the discovery was accidental, but that registering a domain name used by the malware stops it from spreading.
""Essentially they relied on a domain not being registered and by registering it, we stopped their malware spreading,"" @MalwareTechBlog told AFP in a private message on Twitter.
The researcher warned however that people ""need to update their systems ASAP"" to avoid attack.
The attacks used a technique known as ransomware that locks users' files unless they pay the attackers a designated sum in the virtual currency Bitcoin.","malwaretechblog, cyber, switch, attacks, malware, ransomware, kill, told, used, finds, registering, domain, attack, afp, researcher",cyberattack,cyberattack
1101,16-Oct,"2) These kinds of attacks have escalated

Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of 'botnets' made up of thousands of enslaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the Internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid.

Recently, however, the stakes have escalated. What's called the ""Internet of Things"" ","US cyber attacks: Such attacks have escalated recently, underlying problem hard to solve",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-cyber-attacks-have-escalated-recently-underlying-problem-hard-to-solve,"2) These kinds of attacks have escalatedUnfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time.

The victims of the malware include Ukrainian government agencies that provide critical executive branch or emergency response functions, Microsoft said.
Also affected was an information technology firm that manages websites for public- and private-sector clients, including government agencies whose websites were recently defaced.
The United States software giant, which first detected the malware on Thursday, said the malware attacks did not make use of any vulnerability in Microsoft products and services.
Reuters reported on Saturday that Ukraine suspected a hacker group linked to Belarus intelligence had carried out the cyber attack, and that it used malware similar to that used by a group tied to Russian intelligence.","malware, systems, belonging, agencies, websites, victims, technology, ukraine, used, microsoft, work, govt, ukrainian",cyberattack,cyberattack

Alibaba Cloud researcher Chen Zhaojun discovered the flaw in the Log4j open-source software and in November e-mailed it to members of the Apache Software Foundation community, which helps maintain the tool.
That set off a global race by companies, governments and institutions to update critical computer systems before hackers could install backdoors.
Its role in unearthing the Log4j flaw has been hailed by many in the cyber-security industry.
Attempts to exploit the Log4j vulnerability have only escalated in the weeks since the revelation of the flaw, which, if left unfixed, could give hackers unfettered access to millions of computer systems.","flaw, information, alibaba, log4j, software, systems, rebuke, slow, computer, cloud, beijing, vulnerability, industry, report, bug, admits",cyberattack,cyberattack

Russian naval exercises in the Black Sea have exposed the vulnerability of Ukraine's critical ports for commercial shipping.

The malign activity suggests Russian operatives are looking to disrupt or influence the vote, said two officials aware of the attacks and of Germany's response.
It's part of a broad campaign by a disinformation group called ""Ghostwriter"" that Germany has linked to Russian military intelligence.
That's led German officials to worry that compromising information, likely obtained through sophisticated hack-and-leak operations, may be exploited to foment division or steer the vote, the officials said.
As Ms Baerbock's prospects to lead a government have faded since the spring though, the cyber attacks have broadened out.","threat, cyber, intensifying, activity, russian, meddling, attacks, tight, germans, wave, vote, election, kremlin, german, officials",cyberattack,cyberattack
