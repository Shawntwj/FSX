The Chinese navy will ship bulky items such as portable cabins, tractors, generators and water pumps to Tonga in coming days, it added.
Beijing claimed it was the first to supply drinking water and food supplies to Tonga on Jan 19, although this could not be independently verified by Reuters.
The Australian and New Zealand naval vessels have also arrived in Tonga, and Canberra promised an A$3 million (S$2.87 million) in humanitarian funding to Tonga.

""Everyone is still struggling right now,"" said Mr Drew Havea, the vice-president of Tonga Red Cross.
Because of the ash, ""families are making sure their kids are not playing outside, that they are all indoors"", he said.
The psychological impact of waves rushing through and destroying villages will affect their lives for some time, he said.
The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard some 2,300km away in New Zealand.","ring, eruption, tsunami, psychological, volcano, outside, red, waves, tonga, residents, trauma, struggles, ash",natural calamities,geophysical event

""Homes have been completely wiped out,"" Ms Katie Greenwood, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Fiji, said of the three islands, Nomuka, Mango and Fonoifua.
As of Saturday (Jan 22), just three deaths from the tsunami had been confirmed in Tonga.
But Ms Greenwood said Nomuka, Mango and Fonoifua were buffeted by waves almost 50 feet (15m) high, compared with waves of only 4 feet on Tongatapu.

Their plea for global climate action is especially desperate, given that Pacific island nations account for only 0.03 per cent of global carbon emissions, according to the World Bank.
As sea levels continue to rise in coming decades, tsunamis and storm surges will likely be reaching further inland with even more risk of damage.
Sea water that washes ashore can taint agricultural soil and leave it useless for years.
With climate change warming the ocean's surface, such storm surges are more likely as the warm water fuels increasingly powerful cyclones.","islands, tsunamis, tsunami, surges, sea, risk, acute, underscores, global, waves, volcanotriggered, tonga, storm, water, climate",natural calamities,geophysical event

Japan’s meteorological agency issued tsunami warnings in the early hours on Sunday and said waves as high as three metres were expected in the Amami islands in the south.
In a briefing, a Japan Meteorological Agency official urged people not to go near the sea until the tsunami advisory and more serious tsunami warnings had been lifted.
Tsunami waves of 83cm were recorded by gauges in the Tongan capital of Nuku’alofa and two-foot waves were seen at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.

""We know there is some significant damage, and know there is significant damage to resorts,” he said in an interview with an Australian radio station, adding that Tonga’s airport appeared to be in relatively good condition.
The eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano triggered a tsunami on the shores of Tonga and cut off phone and internet lines for the entire island.
Telephone networks in Tonga have been restored but ash was posing a major health concern, contaminating drinking water.

18,Jul-21,"I wish to point out a myth perpetuated by the term ""silver tsunami"" (A 'silver tsunami' looms. What can Singapore do about it?, June 27).

First, it is more accurate to describe the ageing population as a tidal wave rather than a tsunami.

A tsunami is typically caused by sudden shifts in tectonic plates causing a vertical displacement of a large mass of water. Our changing demography is hardly sudden; it is a result of forces over time.

Demographers have been sounding the alarm bells for decades. The ageing population phenomenon more closely resembles an event caused by waves, the result of the demographic forces of a declining birth rate and longer life expectancy.

How we frame an issue will shape the narrative moving forward. Words are important because they evoke associated imagery and ideas. Nobody would associate a tsunami with something positive. Negative labels like ""silver tsunami"" reinforce ageism.

Ageism refers to how we think (stereotypes), feel (prejudice) and act (discrimination) towards others or ourselves based on age. Ageism matters because it affects everyone.

Everyone grows old.

Experts have suggested solutions that include encouraging our seniors to live, work, learn and play longer, but change must start somewhere.

It must begin with changing the mindsets of our policymakers, employers, educators and individual seniors themselves. And mindsets are shaped by the language we use.

According to a report by FrameWorks Institute, we need strategies for disrupting the public's mental modelling of older adults as a group set apart.

Our reframing efforts must enable people to see ageing as a continuous and normal process, not an anomalous event like a tsunami.

Tsunami alerts were issued in countries as far apart as Peru and Australia yesterday, after a trio of large quakes measuring 7.4, 7.3 and 8.1, and dozens of powerful aftershocks, struck near New Zealand's remote Kermadec Islands.

No damage or injuries were reported from the quakes. But the authorities warned that waves of up to 3m were possible in New Caledonia and Vanuatu, where residents in the capital of Port Vila received SMS messages ordering them to move to higher ground.

Eyewitnesses in the city said a small initial surge was visible, but did not appear to cause any damage.

In Noumea, capital of the French territory of New Caledonia, warning sirens sounded.

Emergency services spokesman Alexandre Rossignol took to local radio to warn people to ""leave beach areas and stop all water activities"", and not to pick their children up at schools ""to avoid creating traffic jams"".

Several other regions were warned of lesser, but still potentially dangerous, surges, including New Zealand, where an evacuation order for a swathe of coastal communities was cancelled after a few hours.
