0,Feb-22,MUNICH (NYTIMES) ,Would it be a massive strike or minor incursion if Russia moves on Ukraine?,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/would-it-be-a-massive-strike-or-minor-incursion-if-russia-moves-on-ukraine,"Hours before, Mr Biden had informed them that US intelligence agencies had just learnt that the Kremlin had given the order for Russian military units to proceed with an invasion.
Now the debate has shifted to how Mr Putin will do it: in one massive nationwide attack; a series of bites that dismantle the country, piece by piece; or a python-like squeeze.
Mr Putin might be betting that he can shatter Ukraine's economy and oust its government without having to immediately roll in tanks.
French President Emmanuel Macron said both the US and Russia have agreed to a summit in the coming days.
The White House confirmed Mr Biden had agreed to the meeting with Mr Putin in principle, provided Russia does not invade Ukraine.","russia, incursion, massive, russian, biden, president, intelligence, mr, ukraine, minor, strike, moves, world, piece, coming, putin",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

The French capital's RATP public transport company said six subway lines were closed, down from eight reported earlier on Friday, with the remaining lines operating only partially.
""We call on businesses to make maximum use of home office working,"" Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djeebbari said on Twitter.
In recent years, Paris' public transport system, one of the world's busiest, has been thrown into chaos several times.

The 65-year-old New Zealander, who now trains racehorses, was seen striking a horse several times while attempting to coax it towards a water jump in a cross-country schooling session.
""The Chair of British racing's Independent Judicial Panel has today approved an application from the BHA that an interim suspension should be placed on the training licence of Sir Mark Todd following the emergence over the weekend of a video showing him striking a horse with what appears to be a branch,"" the BHA said in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 16).
The interim suspension means Todd, who trains in Wiltshire in Britain, will be unable to race horses in Britain or internationally until investigations into the circumstances surrounding the incident are carried out.
Todd, who won individual gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles and 1988 Seoul Olympics and also took a bronze medal in the team event at the London 2012 Games, has apologised for the incident.","horse, video, trains, london, racing, suspension, mark, bha, showing, todd, horsestriking, suspended, olympic, striking, champion",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

The move followed health unions ignoring a court order on Thursday instructing them to suspend their strike pending a hearing of a petition against their action.
Sri Lanka is in the grip of a foreign exchange crisis that has crippled the economy, and the unions are demanding better promotional prospects, restructuring of their pay scales and higher allowances.
Thousands of health workers have been taking part in the strike action, leaving only emergency services functioning at state hospitals and putting off many routine services.
Electricity sector workers are not on strike, but they too have threatened trade union action if the government goes ahead with plans to sell a thermal power plant to a US company.","cripple, unions, workers, services, lanka, sri, strikes, outlaws, strike, health, trade, hospitals, action, sectors, union",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

The criticism by the head of state, Mr Gitanas Nauseda, opens a rift in the country's leadership after tensions between China and Lithuania triggered a high-level trade dispute between Beijing and the European Union.
China responded to the opening by downgrading diplomatic ties with Lithuania, recalling its ambassador and allegedly halting clearance for Lithuanian exports, which prompted the EU to raise the dispute with the World Trade Organisation.
Lithuania pulled out its diplomats from its embassy in Beijing in December after the Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded the return of the envoys' diplomatic identification cards.
A Taiwanese company purchased 20,400 bottles of Lithuanian rum that China refused to allow into the country to show support for the Baltic nation, according to the South China Morning Post.","taiwan, foreign, president, spat, mistake, nauseda, diplomatic, trade, rebukes, china, office, chinese, lithuanian, lithuania",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

Watford turned up the pressure after the goal and Joshua King and Moussa Sissoko both missed excellent chances before Joao Pedro popped up to head home brilliantly in the 88th minute and snatch a share of the spoils.
It marked the 10th time Newcastle had been pegged back having taken the lead in the Premier League this season.

The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) said some 80,000 members joined rallies across 13 cities, which caused severe traffic congestion and disruption.
Irregular workers do not receive the full benefits under South Korea's labour laws.
This forced the union members, many clad in pink and white, to march towards Seodaemun Station instead.

Mr Ahmadi, 43, had worked since 2006 as an electrical engineer for Nutrition and Education International (NEI), a California-based aid and lobbying group.

Former US president Donald Trump approved steep tariffs on solar panel imports in January 2018 to protect US producers, triggering an outcry from China and South Korea, and even protests from the American solar industry.
Beijing requested the WTO set up a dispute panel to judge whether the tariffs violated international trade rules, and in its decision, the body said it ""rejected all of China's claims"".
""I welcome the WTO panel's findings rejecting China's challenges to the US solar safeguard as baseless,"" she said in a statement.

Now new research suggests that a number of species of the terrible lizards may have been declining up to 10 million years before the meteor strike.
The team found that species decline began around 76 million years ago.
The team found two possible explanations for the falling dinosaur diversity identified in the fossil records and their own computer modelling.
The study concluded that not only did a cooling climate and reduced diversity among herbivores lead to the dinosaurs' slow decline, it also left the various species unable to recover after the meteor strike.","million, cooling, herbivores, study, species, diversity, decline, dinosaurs, team, meteor, strike, dinosaur, declined",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

A: Singapore has among the highest number of lightning strikes per annum. But no car has been known to have been damaged by lightning.

Lightning always strikes the highest point in a vicinity. For lightning to hit a vehicle, it must be at an elevation and in an open area with few buildings or trees around. Such a spot is rare in Singapore.

The vehicle's fuel system is similarly insulated. Its electrical and electronic components may, however, be damaged.

Vietnam has been on Washington's watch list of currency manipulators because of its trade surplus with the US, a large current-account surplus and a perception that its central bank has been actively buying foreign currency.

Mr Phuc in a statement asked Mr Boehler to tell Mr Trump and the USTR to ""have a more objective assessment of reality in Vietnam"" with regard to the trade imbalance.

326,Sep-20,"NEW YORK • The World Trade Organisation (WTO) yesterday undercut the main justification for US President Donald Trump's trade war against China, saying that American tariffs on Chinese goods violate international rules.

Washington has imposed levies on more than US$550 billion (S$749 billion) in Chinese exports.

A panel of three WTO trade experts said the US broke international rules when it imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018.
The dispute centres on the Trump administration's use of a 1970s-era US trade law to unilaterally launch its commercial conflict against China in 2018.
China claimed the tariffs violated the WTO's most-favoured treatment provision because the measures failed to provide the same treatment to all WTO members.
The US tariffs against China were authorised under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which empowers the president to levy tariffs and other import restrictions whenever a foreign country imposes unfair trade practices that affect US commerce.","measures, tariffs, chinese, trump, wtos, violate, war, international, trade, china, world, wto, washington, rules",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

Bilbao almost opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime, however Alex Berenguer's free kick bounced just wide of Thibaut Courtois's far post.
Casemiro had a header bounce back off the crossbar shortly after the restart, however the Brazilian midfielder then teed up defender Nacho from close range to give Zinedine Zidane's side a priceless three points.

353,Feb-21,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi on Sunday, made after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Teheran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency today.

Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since the United States, under former president Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.

The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms.

US President Joe Biden has said he wants to talk about both nations returning to the accord, though the two sides have been at odds about who makes the first step.

Teheran over the weekend renewed its demand that the US rejoin the accord and lift its crippling sanctions on Iran before talks can resume.

A key part of Iran's plan for reducing cooperation is to end implementation of the additional protocol, under which Teheran allows the IAEA to carry out unannounced inspections of nuclear material and installations where undeclared activity is suspected.

""The additional protocol, much to my regret, is going to be suspended,"" Mr Grossi said.

While the IAEA can still enter Iran to account for declared nuclear stockpiles, oversight of places such as machine shops and mines involved in uranium enrichment will be lost, as will camera surveillance of Iranian nuclear sites.

The IAEA and Teheran earlier issued a joint statement saying Iran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.

The IAEA will also continue ""necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months"", the statement said, without specifying what those activities are.

Mr Grossi said the steps that Iran plans to take this week would be ""to a certain extent mitigated"" by the terms of this new, temporary deal",UN nuclear watchdog strikes deal with Iran,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/un-nuclear-watchdog-strikes-deal-with-iran,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

Azevedo's early departure will come at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has pushed the global economy and international trade into turmoil, facing downturns not seen since the Great Depression.

The delayed award provides a fresh source of potential trade friction weeks before the US presidential election, after Washington last year began imposing tariffs on US$7.5 billion worth of EU goods over state support for Boeing rival Airbus.
Both sides are expected to claim victory, however, with US sources pointing to the higher core tariffs in favour of Boeing.
European sources said the latest award does not include some US$4.2 billion of tariffs against the US left over from an earlier case, giving the EU US$8.2 billion in total firepower.
The US says that previous award granting the EU tariffs over special tax treatment for US exporters, which it never implemented, is no longer valid because a law creating the disputed system was repealed in 2006.","us4b, goods, backs, tariffs, boeing, award, worth, billion, sides, trade, subsidies, sources, wto, washington, eu",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

Analysts say the very idea that Japan might acquire a strike capability - even if couched in the name of defence - is controversial and would be one of the greatest paradigm shifts in Japanese defence policy since the war.
But Mr Abe stressed that Japan will act within the framework of its war-renouncing Constitution and comply with international law, emphasising: ""There is no change to our defence-oriented posture.""
Analysts said the timing was a deliberate attempt by Mr Abe to imprint his legacy on defence issues after his controversial bid to revise the Constitution fell apart.
A first-strike capability means Japan will be able to launch a strike on enemy bases before missiles are even fired - unlike now when it can stop targets after they are launched.","firststrike, way, paves, defence, successor, japan, country, mr, shinzo, abe, strike, capability, statement, japanese, missile",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

Everton on the other hand were left to rue a huge missed opportunity to bolster their European credentials.

Yet, behind the scenes a more productive discussion is taking place, with both desperately searching for new approaches to a relationship for which there is no legal precedent.

Britain's future trade arrangement with the EU is the first priority, partly because this is the most complex challenge, but also because the negotiations over a future trade deal operate under a very tight timetable.

According to the schedule agreed between London and Brussels, all the trade talks must be concluded by the end of the year, when the current transitory arrangements, which allow both sides to trade as though no separation had taken place, expire.

In practice, the timetable is even shorter, for the trade talks are being launched only early next month, and have to conclude by November at the latest, since 28 various national Parliaments will need to ratify the deal.

And the gap between the sides is huge.

The EU naturally wants Britain to sign up to all its regulations and standards, if it is to agree to a broad free trade deal which includes manufactured goods, services and food.

""That matters, because with unrealistic export targets, the deal may be doomed from the start.
The unrealistic nature of China's purchase commitments has been a common criticism of the trade deal, especially from China watchers and trade experts who call for US President Donald Trump to focus more on restructuring China's market economy and ending its unfair trade practices rather than shrinking the US-China trade deficit.
But even when China's economy was booming from 2000 to 2007, US exports to China grew by 21 per cent a year in that period, Dr Bown said.
""With China's economy currently growing much more slowly, for reasons unrelated to the trade war, sustaining 18 per cent annual export growth over a four-year period would be a challenge,"" he wrote.","economist, deal, pledges, cent, billion, trade, purchase, china, unrealistic, chinas, economy, 2017, exports",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

Yet his stature as the second most powerful person in Iran made him almost untouchable in the eyes of Donald Trump's predecessors.
Soon after the attack, Trump ordered a handful of his most senior aides to begin planning a strike on the Iranian general, according to three people familiar with the matter.
A small number of lawyers on the National Security Council were involved.
Secrecy was paramount, as aides worried that one of Trump's most fraught and consequential decisions would be leaked ahead of the strike.","iranian, tight, trump, aides, washington, general, powerful, swiftly, national, strike, attack, security, soleimani, obrien, trumps, circle, planned",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

There were no reports of casualties in the strikes that Israel's military said targeted underground infrastructure belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza.
Israel has struck Hamas facilities almost nightly for the past two weeks, saying it would not tolerate the balloons.
With tension high, Israel has closed its only commercial crossing with Gaza, banned sea access and halted fuel imports into the coastal strip, leading to its only power plant shutting down last week.
Health officials have voiced concern that the power plant shut down could aggravate a novel coronavirus outbreak in Gaza, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.","balloons, targets, strip, military, palestinians, power, amid, gaza, strikes, israel, israeli, incendiary, covid19, hamas, plant, lockdown",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

The city state made the list of 20 global markets that are most rapidly improving their individual potential for trade to grow, coming in at 16th place, according to the bank's new Trade20 Index.

The Trade20 study examined 12 metrics across 66 economies, analysing changes across three equally weighted pillars of economic dynamism, trade readiness and export diversity.

The economic dynamism pillar was measured by inward foreign direct investments (FDI), export volume growth and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Trade readiness refers to the market's foundations to support future trade growth, measured by factors such as the quality of trade and transport infrastructure and ease of doing business, while export diversity was measured by factors such as export count.

Topping the list was Cote d'Ivoire, followed by India, Kenya and China. Hong Kong took 11th place, above Sri Lanka at 14th.

Singapore's ranking in the index was largely thanks to its economic dynamism, amid increasing levels of inward FDI, StanChart said. The Republic had placed fourth in the 2019 world ranking of FDI destinations by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

The WTO appellate branch normally counts seven judges but has just three left - the minimum required to hear an appeal.
US concerns regarding the WTO appeals court include allegations of judicial overreach, delays in rendering decisions and judges' bloated salaries.
But top American trade officials have also insisted that the US Constitution does not permit a foreign court to supersede an American one - and that WTO appellate judges assert such superiority in international trade law.","brink, concerns, wtos, trade, judges, american, court, world, collapse, wto, appellate, dispute",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

In the context of smoking, it is the smokers' right to decide how and when they wish to do whatever chosen amount of harm to their bodies.

Lawmakers are always in a dilemma because despite recognising the third",Forum: Striking a balance between personal liberty and public health,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/striking-a-balance-between-personal-liberty-and-public-health,"Smoking kills smokers and the people around them, and many in the community have called for a ban on cigarettes.

In the context of smoking, it is the smokers' right to decide how and when they wish to do whatever chosen amount of harm to their bodies.
Singapore's approach to the issue has been effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking among the young by introducing more barriers to entry.
By raising the legal age to smoke, raising tobacco tax and banning smoking in more places, Singapore is making it harder for non-smokers to pick up smoking.","harm, right, balance, liberty, smokers, ban, young, public, smoking, reducing, health, bodies, raising, forum, striking, liberties, personal",trade dispute,Trade Dispute
551,Oct-19,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING • China hopes to reach a phased agreement in a protracted trade dispute with the US and cancel tariffs as soon as possible, the Commerce Ministry said yesterday, adding that trade wars had no winners.

A phased agreement would help restore market confidence and reduce uncertainty, said ministry spokesman Gao Feng, adding that both sides were maintaining close communication.

""The final goal of both sides' negotiations is to end the trade war and cancel all additional tariffs,"" he said. ""This would benefit China, the United States and the whole world. We hope that both sides will continue to work together, advance negotiations, and reach a phased agreement as soon as possible.""

US President Donald Trump last week outlined the first phase of a deal and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said more work needed to be done. Mr Trump had planned to proceed with a hike in tariffs to 30 per cent from 25 per cent on about US$250 billion (S$342 billion) worth of Chinese goods last week.

The US administration has yet to decide on how to address an additional planned 10 per cent tariffs on roughly US$156 billion worth of Chinese goods due to take effect on Dec 15.

US and Chinese negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, said US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday, adding that he was prepared to travel to Beijing for more meetings if necessary.

The strike pits Mr Macron, a 41-year-old former investment banker who came to power in 2017 on a promise to open up France's highly regulated economy, against powerful trade unions who say he is set on dismantling worker protections.
Mr Macron's government, along with many ordinary French citizens, have made plans to cope with the strike action through the weekend, but may take a different view on Monday if the disruption extends into a second week.
Rail workers voted to extend their strike through Friday, while labour unions at the Paris bus and metro operator RATP said their walkout would continue until Monday.

578,Aug-19,"And that is what's happening.

German has spewed wretched economic data for weeks: an 8 per cent annual fall in exports in June, a 1.5 per cent drop in industrial production in June from the month before, three times bigger than expected.

Surveys of company executives suggest the industrial sector is in recession, with consumer demand and services propping up the economy.

But the damage from trade may be spreading to consumers and companies that do business only at home. While unemployment remains low at 3.1 per cent, job gains have stalled recently.

Ironically, trade between Germany and the US and between Germany and China is holding up pretty well. It's mainly the uncertainty about the outcome of the clash between US President Donald Trump and the Chinese Communist leadership that has been weighing on business confidence and deterring decisions to invest and buy across global markets.

Last week, Mr Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$300 billion (S$415.64 billion) in Chinese goods effective Sept 1.

As a result, research firm Oxford Economics forecasts world trade growth of just 1.2 per cent this year, far below last year's 4.9 per cent rise.

There are a few small benefits for Europe. While the US and China ramped up barriers against each other, the US has largely kept tariffs on European products the same, except for introducing charges on steel and aluminum imports. China has actually lowered charges on exports from the 19 European countries that use the euro.

""That mildly positive effect for the eurozone has been, however, more than offset by the hit to business sentiment and demand,"" says economist Florian Hense at Berenberg bank. ""As uncertainty about the future trading regime is pervasive, businesses have cut their outlook and their investment plans. The slowdown in Chinese actual and potential growth, which the trade tensions have exacerbated, also weighs on demand for eurozone exports.""

Mr Trump has recently repeated threats to increase tariffs on autos if he does not get a satisfactory new trade deal with the EU.

Germany's top companies issued cautious outlooks along with their earnings for the most recent quarter, even those that are doing relatively well.

Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess warned that ""growing protectionism also poses major challenges for the globally integrated auto industry."" Siemens AG CEO Joe Kaeser said that ""geopolitics and geo",US-China trade war leaves Europe as collateral damage,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/us-china-trade-war-leaves-europe-as-collateral-damage,"Surveys of company executives suggest the industrial sector is in recession, with consumer demand and services propping up the economy.

It is a tool that must be used with care, and can both generate economic development and create tensions.

The unions represent almost two dozen industries, including aviation, transport, construction, technology and tourism.
China on Saturday announced details of the national security legislation, unveiling that Beijing will have overarching powers over its enforcement and signalling the deepest change to the city's way of life since the handover.
The planned law has alarmed foreign governments as well as democracy activists in Hong Kong, who were already concerned that Beijing was tightening its grip over the semi-autonomous city.
Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong have sought to reassure investors that the law will not erode the city's high degree autonomy, insisting it will target only a minority of""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security.","unions, support, fail, hong, legislation, citys, national, strikes, beijing, security, law, prodemocracy, kong, short, students",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

The new policy would be within the boundaries of international law, the country's war-renouncing constitution and its exclusively defensive national security posture, the Sankei newspaper said, citing officials it didn't identify.
Acquiring such capability could cost huge sums of money and increase the likelihood that Japan would be the target of an attack.
Japan's National Security Council, which Abe leads and includes key cabinet officials, including Suga, convened on Friday and said in a statement it would formulate a new national security strategy by the end of the year.
One of the last major decisions this year from the Abe government was to drop plans to build the US-backed Aegis Ashore ballistic-missile-defence programme.","swansong, strategy, officials, tokyo, japans, national, suga, missilestrike, security, capability, push, statement, abe, prime, missile",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

629,Sep-19,"SAN FRANCISCO • Trade policy uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's escalating dispute with China will mean hundreds of billions of dollars in lost US output and as much as US$850 billion (S$1.18 trillion) lost globally through early next year, research published this week by the Federal Reserve suggests.

The Fed researchers analysed newspaper articles and corporate earnings calls to estimate trade policy uncertainty, finding that it has recently ""shot up to levels not seen since the 1970s"".

Other economists, notably Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom and his colleagues, have documented a similar rise in uncertainty.

The Fed researchers then estimated the blow such uncertainty delivers to economic activity, as businesses pull back on investment and production. They concluded that globally and in the United States, its impact is around 1 per cent to GDP.

With United States GDP estimated at about US$20 trillion, and world GDP at about US$85 trillion, a 1 per cent impact would put the drag from trade uncertainty at about US$200 billion to US GDP, and US$850 billion to global GDP, according to Reuters calculations.

The estimates, the researchers said, are uncertain.

But they are notable in that they are among the first to quantify the large impact of US President Donald Trump's approach to trade deals, which he says put the US economy at a global disadvantage.

In an effort to win better trade terms, the Trump administration has jacked up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports and imposed or threatened to impose duties on imports from other trading partners, including Mexico and the European Union. China and other countries, in turn, have threatened or imposed their own tariffs on US goods.

Mr Trump has called on the Fed to slash US interest rates to support the economy and offset the effects of the trade war.

Fed policymakers for their part have said they will not let politics dictate interest",Trade uncertainty to shave $1.2 trillion off global output: Study,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/trade-uncertainty-to-shave-12-trillion-off-global-output-study,"The Fed researchers analysed newspaper articles and corporate earnings calls to estimate trade policy uncertainty, finding that it has recently ""shot up to levels not seen since the 1970s"".

630,Sep-20,TOKYO ,Japan PM Abe to oversee talks on first-strike capability,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/abe-to-oversee-talks-on-first-strike-capability,"TOKYO - One of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's final tasks in office will be to decide on whether to acquire weapons that allow pre-emptive strike capability against enemy missile bases in other countries, local media have reported, citing government sources.
Some domestic and foreign policy experts have also argued that it is a slippery slope towards aggression and militarism.
Mr Abe, who abruptly resigned last Friday (Aug 28) but is staying on as PM until a successor is chosen, will likely map out a new security policy at a National Security Council meeting to be held by next week.
Mr Abe will also oversee talks on an alternative plan for the United States' land-based Aegis Ashore anti-ballistic missile system, which Japan ditched in June after it found that a costly technical redesign was necessary to ensure that boosters would not fall on residential areas.
The Aegis Ashore system had been meant to beef up Japan's missile defences against external threats, primarily North Korea.","policy, talks, firststrike, enemy, system, japan, weapons, japans, ashore, security, capability, oversee, abe, missile",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

In contrast, hardline CGT union warned last Thursday that there would be no break for Christmas unless the government dropped the whole pension reform plan.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told Le Parisien Dimanche he would meet unions next week, and asked everyone to take responsibility ahead of Christmas.

The strikes, which began on Thursday over plans for a single, points-based pension scheme, recalled the winter of 1995, when three weeks of stoppages forced a social policy U-turn by the then-government.
The biggest labour unrest in years comes as France's economy is already dented by more than a year of weekly anti-government protests by ""yellow vest"" activists, and with Mr Macron's popularity falling.
The mass strike closed schools on Thursday and hobbled commuters in Paris and its suburbs as well as other major cities through the weekend.
Many opted to take days off or to work from home, but thousands had no choice but to squeeze into perilously overfull suburban trains and metros whose numbers were slashed to a minimum.","chaos, thousands, pension, paris, unrelenting, macrons, retirement, transport, labour, country, strike, french, frances, yellow, work, bites",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

They found that the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection was the same for women and men, as ""exactly half"" of the confirmed cases were male patients.
But the men are almost three times more likely than the women to be hospitalised in an intensive care unit and are 39 per cent more likely to die from the virus, the study said on Wednesday.

665,Jun-19,"Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May shipments from the world's largest exporter to have fallen 3.8 per cent from a year earlier, after a contraction of 2.7 per cent in April.

While China is not as dependent on exports as in the past, they still account for nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product.

Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply last month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.

Mr Trump on May 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of Chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining US$300 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on US goods.

Mr Trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Group of 20 leaders' summit later this month, but analysts such as Capital Economics believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding, as both sides appear to be digging in for a long battle.

Trade sanctions are spreading from goods to services, Capital Economics noted last week, with China issuing a warning to citizens about risks of travelling in the US and American lawmakers pushing to tighten visas for Chinese students.

Damage from the trade war along with a broader softening in global demand will make 2019 the worst year for trade since the financial crisis a decade ago, with only 0.2 per cent growth, according to economists at ING.

The action could escalate a trade dispute between Indonesia - the world's top palm oil producer - and the EU, which plans to end its use of biofuels by 2030, citing concerns over widespread deforestation caused by the sector.
In response to what it called ""discriminative"" policies against its key palm oil exports, Indonesia said it filed a complaint with the WTO last week.
Neighbouring Malaysia, the world's second-biggest palm oil producer, has also threatened WTO action against the EU.
Ms Teresa Kok, the minister overseeing Malaysia's palm oil sector, told AFP on Monday that she would head to Europe in March, and a challenge would not be filed until after then.","filed, world, organisation, producer, worlds, plans, indonesia, trade, files, lawsuit, palm, wto, eu, oil",trade dispute,Trade Dispute

745,Mar-19,"WASHINGTON • The US goods trade deficit surged to a record high last year as strong domestic demand fuelled by lower taxes pulled in imports, despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, including tariffs, aimed at shrinking the trade gap.

President Donald Trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield US manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition. He has pledged to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that a 12.4 per cent jump in the goods deficit in December had contributed to the record US$891.3 billion (S$1.2 trillion) goods trade shortfall last year.

The overall trade deficit surged 12.5 per cent to US$621 billion last year, the largest since 2008.

China is said to be unwilling to make concessions on ""issues of principle"".

It remains unclear whether the two countries can salvage a trade agreement that is complicated by political dynamics on both sides of the Pacific.

Mr. Trump, who has promised to be tough on China, might stop short of concluding a weak deal that does not take advantage of the leverage the United States has created with its tariffs.

806,Aug-19,"China's central bank has flatly rejected the decision by the United States to label it a currency manipulator and warned that the move would ""prevent a global economic and trade recovery"".

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) also said that Washington's latest salvo, which escalates tensions between the two countries, would ""severely damage international financial order and cause chaos in the financial markets"".

The Chinese response came after the US Treasury Department said on Monday that it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency. The Dow crashed 2.9 per cent, or 767 points, as tensions mounted.

The ""currency manipulator"" label opened the door to even higher tariffs on Chinese products after the yuan had slipped past seven to the US dollar on Monday, its lowest in a decade.

""While the US has continuously escalated the trade dispute since 2018, China has always insisted on not engaging in competitive devaluation,"" PBOC said yesterday. ""China has not and will not use its exchange rate as a tool to deal with trade disputes.""

The statement echoed PBOC governor Yi Gang's comments on Monday that China has not weaponised the yuan. But in a barely veiled warning, PBOC added: ""China advised the United States to rein in its horse before the precipice, and be aware of its errors, and turn back from the wrong path.""

The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council has unveiled two tariff exclusion lists of 16 items, including fish meal, raw materials used in cancer drugs and some lubricants.
