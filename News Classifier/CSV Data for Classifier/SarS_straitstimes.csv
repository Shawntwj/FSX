0,Dec-21,SINGAPORE ,Singapore's 'batman' receives top science award for research in Sars and Covid-19,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapores-batman-receives-top-science-award-for-research-in-sars-and-covid-19,"SINGAPORE - A ""batman"" who helped trace the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) back to bats and is now involved in the Covid-19 fight has bagged the President's Science Award.
The award is part of the annual President's Science and Technology Awards (PSTA) given to scientists whose work has led to significant scientific, technological or economic benefits for the country.
The other awards under the PSTA are the President's Science and Technology Medal - the nation's top scientific honour - and the President's Technology Award.
Soon after the 2003 Sars outbreak, Prof Wang, 61, led an international team of experts who traced the Sars-CoV-1 virus that caused the disease to bats.
In the areas of Covid-19 research, Prof Wang and his team developed a test kit last year that detects whether someone has antibodies which neutralise the coronavirus.","antibodies, presidents, work, batman, singapores, receives, wang, sars, technology, research, science, award, cpass, test, prof, covid19, psta",Human health crises,pandemic
1,Sep-21,VIENTIANE (BLOOMBERG) ,Bats in Laos caves found to carry coronaviruses that share key feature with Sars-CoV-2,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/bats-in-laos-caves-harbour-closest-relatives-to-covid-19-virus,"VIENTIANE (BLOOMBERG) - Bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos were found to carry coronaviruses that share a key feature with Sars-CoV-2, moving scientists closer to pinpointing the cause of Covid-19.
Researchers at France's Pasteur Institute and the University of Laos looked for viruses similar to the one that causes Covid-19 among hundreds of horseshoe bats.
They found three with closely matched receptor binding domains - the part of the coronavirus' spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, the enzyme it targets to cause an infection.
The BANAL-236 virus has an almost identical receptor binding domain to the pandemic virus, according to the paper.
It is a feature of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that has led some scientists to theorise that it was created in a laboratory.","sarscov2, coronaviruses, caves, binding, nature, sampling, carry, laos, viruses, receptor, key, feature, share, pandemic, virus, bats",Human health crises,pandemic
2,Aug-21,SINGAPORE ,Booster jab targeting Sars virus may be effective for all Covid-19 variants: S'pore scientists,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/booster-jab-targeting-sars-virus-may-be-effective-for-all-covid-19-variants-and-future,"SINGAPORE - Scientists here have found that people who have recovered from Sars in 2003 and who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are able to produce antibodies to neutralise all known Covid-19 variants of concern.
The findings could pave the way for the development of a booster jab, which may involve targeting the Sars-CoV-1 virus responsible for the Sars epidemic in 2003, to offer a broader spectrum of protection for future variants and coronaviruses.
Neutralising antibodies are able to prevent the viral spike protein from binding with the ACE2 molecules in human cells.
To test their hypothesis, the researchers then recruited eight people who recovered from Sars-CoV-1, 10 healthy people and 10 people who recovered from Covid-19.
The investigations were conducted using an improved version of Duke-NUS' surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT).","antibodies, sarscov1, jab, spore, known, neutralising, sars, variants, scientists, recovered, effective, booster, test, dukenus, targeting, covid19, virus",Human health crises,pandemic
3,Aug-21,SINGAPORE ,"Debrief: Origins of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/debrief-origins-of-the-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-that-causes-covid-19,"SINGAPORE - Scientists are no closer to finding out the origins of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, nearly two years after it was first reported to have emerged in China.
To date, more than 215 million Covid-19 cases and 4.48 million deaths have been recorded worldwide, and the number is still climbing.
Covid-19 was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and spread rapidly across the globe.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) team investigating the origins of Sars-CoV-2 earlier this year also suggested that the virus most likely infected humans from an intermediate animal host.
The report, released in Washington on Friday, said several organisations within the sprawling US intelligence community believed that the virus emerged from ""natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus"", but they had only ""low confidence"" in that conclusion.","sarscov2, origins, causes, emerged, biological, fort, debrief, various, wuhan, chinese, covid19, virus, theory",Human health crises,pandemic
4,Aug-21,SINGAPORE ,Sars-CoV-2 virus can change its shape to improve survival: Singapore study,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-study-find-sars-cov-2-virus-can-change-its-shape-to-improve-survival,"SINGAPORE - Scientists here have made an important discovery about the shape and structure of the Sars-CoV-2 virus' genetic material that can help in producing more effective drugs to treat Covid-19.
The Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, has a single-strand genome that is made up of RNA as its genetic material.
When the virus infects and enters the human cell, the spike protein on the surface of its cell binds with the human or host cell receptor.
As the virus' genetic material closely resembles that of human cellular RNA, the human cell is therefore ""tricked"" into helping the virus to create its proteins.
Aside from the discovering the shape and structure of the Sars-CoV-2 virus' genetic material, the team also learnt that the virus binds with a small nucleolar RNA, or snoRNA, to steal its modification abilities.","sarscov2, survival, human, viral, shape, genetic, rna, change, singapore, study, genome, cell, virus, improve",Human health crises,pandemic
5,Jul-21,MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) ,"Covid-19 origins mirror Sars genesis in animals, study finds",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/covid-19-origins-mirror-sars-genesis-in-animals-study-finds,"MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - Early Covid-19 cases traced to markets in Wuhan, China, mirror the initial spread of Sars 17 years earlier, scientists said in a paper that concludes that an animal contagion is the most likely explanation for the pandemic's genesis.
It gives a detailed explanation for Sars-CoV-2's genetic signatures, early epidemiology and research undertaken at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Debate about Covid-19's emergence has coalesced around two competing ideas: a laboratory escape or a spillover from animals.
The link to Wuhan, therefore, more likely reflects the fact that pathogens often require heavily populated areas to become established.
Initial Sars-CoV-2 cases are not likely to have spread the virus to other people, and only a small subset of spillover events from animals to humans results in major outbreaks.","origins, sarscov2, animal, pandemics, cases, animals, authors, finds, sars, genesis, university, studies, study, likely, mirror, wuhan, covid19, virus",Human health crises,pandemic

Professor Hanry Yu, co-corresponding author of the study, told The Straits Times on Tuesday (June 8) that PCR tests have two main drawbacks.
Prof Yu said there exists a more precise version of the PCR method, known as the digital PCR method.
Conventional PCR tests can take about an hour, said Dr Xiaolin Wu, a postdoctoral associate at Smart Camp.
The second drawback is that all PCR tests require expensive, specialised machinery as samples need to be put through a wide range of temperatures.","sarscov2, alliance, different, yu, singaporemit, sample, precise, pcr, scientists, detect, singapore, test, value, tests, develop, smart, method",Human health crises,pandemic

All three are horseshoe bats from the genus Rhinolophus.
The researchers also used serological tests to determine if bats and pangolins - another animal shown to carry coronaviruses similar to Sars-CoV-2 - had neutralising antibodies against the virus.
For the bats, four out of 98 serum samples showed the presence of strong positive neutralising antibodies.

11,May-20,"When Parliament meets on Monday, lawmakers will debate and are expected to pass a constitutional amendment that will allow MPs to be spread out at different locations while it is in session.

This is the first Bill of its kind, and would lay the ground for Parliament to convene through virtual means if necessary, such as for safe distancing reasons amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Called the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, it will be introduced under a Certificate of Urgency, which allows for it to be debated and passed in a single session.

But old political hands recall that Singapore's Parliament had blazed this trail back in 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak, when some members addressed the House remotely for the first time while under the same roof or at home.

THE FIGHT AGAINST SARS

On April 24, 2003, Parliament met to discuss the Government's response to Sars. All MPs, without exception, had their temperature taken on arrival at Parliament House. But four officeholders in the ministerial combat unit against Sars isolated themselves from their colleagues and addressed Parliament from a separate room as an added precaution.

The team was led by then Senior Minister of State Khaw Boon Wan, a former senior civil servant with experience in the Ministry of Health.

12,Feb-20,"Anxiety is creeping up as the virus which originated in Wuhan spreads around the world, showing no sign as yet of abating.

Singapore is at code orange in its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition, a crisis management system drafted and refined after Singapore's experience of tackling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003.

It was at yellow for days before being raised to orange on Friday evening, after a few local cases emerged without any links to previous cases or travel history to China.

Will it move to red, which would mean the virus is severe and spreading widely?

From what is known publicly, the coronavirus appears to be more infectious than Sars, which hit Singapore in 2003 from March to May, infecting 238 and killing 33.

Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide over several months, and killed about 774.

However, the coronavirus appears less deadly, with a mortality rate of about 2 per cent, compared with Sars' 9.6 per cent.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome virus in 2012 infected about 2,500 people worldwide but was deadlier, with a fatality rate of 34 per cent.

With the coronavirus, as of yesterday, more than 34,000 have been infected since December, and more than 700 have died in China.

In Singapore, there are 40 infected persons as of yesterday.

Outside of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the mortality rate is only 0.2 per cent so far, while seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. This makes the new virus much closer to influenza than Sars.

Then a junior nurse in her early 20s, Ms Chong had taken a very ill patient to the coronary care unit at the National University Hospital (NUH) during a night shift. The patient was later found to be infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars.

A day later, Ms Chong developed a rapidly rising fever. She was later taken to TTSH where her temperature continued to climb, hitting 39.5 deg C at one point. Anxious thoughts raced through her mind as she fought chills and body aches during her hospitalisation.

She worried that she might have inadvertently infected her mother. She would feel depressed at the thought of the many things she had yet to accomplish and wondered if she would even survive.

Ms Chong, now 40, is currently a senior nurse clinician in the general and geriatric wards at Alexandra Hospital.

Ms Noor Melati Ahmad, 38, another nurse who had been working in the same NUH ward as Ms Chong, also caught the virus from a patient during a night shift.

She was also warded at TTSH. Like Ms Chong, she felt very weak and experienced body aches, chills and had difficulty breathing.

Chinese news site The Paper reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan in December, citing unnamed health officials from the city.
It is unclear whether all these patients are suspected of having contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), a highly contagious respiratory disease.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) criticised China for under-reporting the number of Sars cases following the outbreak in 2003.
Sars killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2003.","outbreak, links, probes, patients, suspected, cases, china, sars, wuhan, pneumonia, health, media, state, respiratory",Human health crises,pandemic

This is because China's contribution to global metal consumption has increased to about 50 per cent, from below 20 per cent in 2003.
According to DBS, it took about two months for metal prices to recover to pre-Sars levels.
The brokerage also expects the adverse impact of the virus to be greater than Sars, as China posted high economic growth in 2003, versus decelerating growth this year.
Meanwhile, the brokerage believes that gold and silver prices will continue to be buoyed by favourable investment sentiment, riding on their status as safe-haven assets.","virus, outbreak, dbs, growth, impact, coronavirus, prices, metal, sars, cent, commodities, economic, bigger, hit",Human health crises,pandemic

This becomes even more critical as the number of people affected by the virus increases.

While the Government has introduced a wide range of measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, members of the public must also take steps to protect themselves and others.

For instance, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, as they could have come into contact with germs.

Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly for at least 30 seconds with soap and water. This reduces the chances of viral transmission. Also, if you are unwell, wear a mask when you go out.

When you eat in hawker centres and foodcourts, make the effort to return your used utensils and trays so that the table is clean for the next diner.

When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with tissue, and throw the soiled tissue into a bin immediately.

It is most important now, when we are battling the deadly virus, that we do not litter, as this only encourages the spread of germs.

When Sars hit us 17 years ago, Singaporeans rallied together and worked with the Government to overcome the crisis. We must do the same now.

Singapore will be better prepared to handle an outbreak today if all Singaporeans play their part to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Two scientists, Shi Zhengli and Cui Jie from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Hubei province, led the research team, sampling thousands of wild horseshoe bats from nine provinces.
In one particular cave in Yunnan province, the research team found that the strains of coronavirus looked similar to human versions of Sars.
Later, a large number of Sars-related coronaviruses were found in horseshoe bats.
The report by the Wuhan team shows multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of horseshoe bats and their coronavirus.","remote, province, wild, yunnan, sars, scientists, origin, cave, strain, close, research, horseshoe, virus, bats",Human health crises,pandemic

96,Feb-18,"Associate editor Vikram Khanna has given us a comprehensive analysis of the problems facing Singapore currently, namely ageing, immigration and productivity (Reframing the debate on ageing and immigration; Jan 31).

Many countries, including Singapore, are experiencing a combination of declining birth rate and increasing longevity. Greying populations pose serious issues for society, especially policymakers.

One way to overcome the economic constraints would be to boost productivity, so that more goods and services are produced from the same amount of input, hence giving society more output to divvy up.

However, while production may increase as the population ages, there comes a point where the effects of ageing begin to affect the majority of workers. Production would experience a decline.

New technologies, research and development, exports, imports and foreign direct investment have to be key drivers of productivity.

Improved education among the population aged above 60 and delays in retirement among better educated workers, will help to boost the earnings of older workers.

Meanwhile, migrants can take jobs where natives are in short supply, such as bus driving, construction jobs, healthcare services and domestic help.

Migrants help to expand an economy's productive capacity, stimulate investment and, in the long run, boost productivity.

This was seen in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, when there was an influx of German Jewish emigres, as well as in Germany in the 1960s, when Turkish workers helped it catch up with the US in productivity terms.

Singapore's economy should do well with an ageing population and controlled immigration policies.

Its 50 mutations include more than 30 on the spike protein, the exposed part of the virus that binds with human cells.
These could make it more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant and more likely to evade the immune protection conferred by vaccines or previous infection.
Omicron's distinctive mutation pattern means that conventional PCR tests can distinguish it from Delta and other variants, without the need for full genome sequencing.
By comparison, the Delta variant that has come to dominate the pandemic worldwide reduced the effectiveness of vaccines with just three mutations in this region.","virus, sparked, vaccines, know, variant, mutations, genetic, covid19, unprecedented, omicron, variants, strain, global, delta, alarm",Human health crises,pandemic

Four months later, researchers studying those who contracted the virus are gaining important insights into the immunity-bolstering effects of natural infection after vaccination.
Importantly, their findings offer clues about the immune protection needed for the coronavirus to cease being a public-health menace and, ultimately, to end the pandemic.
That surprising finding undercut overly optimistic expectations that the inoculations could eliminate Sars-CoV-2 transmission, particularly given the twice-as-infectious Delta strain.

The extracted RNA is tested using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain technique - used commonly in swab tests - to detect the virus.
The surveillance system was trialled in three hospital wards for Covid-19 patients from February to May last year.
Dr Irvan Luhung, a senior research fellow from SCELSE, said the air surveillance technique could go a long way in keeping healthcare workers safe.
Associate Professor David Allen from NUS Medicine's Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme, who also co-led the study, said the air surveillance technique could be an additional tool for mass screening, in addition to wastewater sampling, for example.","researchers, research, warning, sampling, risks, air, technique, hospitals, swab, singapore, nursing, surveillance, covid19, virus, scelse, rna, infection, early, homes",Human health crises,pandemic

It is China's locally developed mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine candidate furthest along in trial progress.
In a lab study analysing samples from 11 vaccinated people, eight demonstrated ""low but detectable"" neutralisation activity against Omicron, researchers said in a letter to editors published in the journal Cell Research.
The neutralising antibody level against Omicron showed a 47-fold reduction compared with the level against a ""wild-type"" that contains no major mutations, said the paper published on Monday (Feb 14).
The researchers said they also conducted animal tests on two new mRNA vaccine candidates targeting Omicron and the result showed that the induced antibody levels were comparable to those elicited by the original ARCoV.","weaker, researchers, tests, trial, potential, antibody, showed, omicron, mrna, study, vaccine, chinas, covid19, developed",Human health crises,pandemic

Next, there is the problem of how to keep people from falling ill, which is linked to vaccinations, he said.
All these are aspects of urban preparedness, he said.
The minister was speaking at an information session on strengthening health emergency preparedness in urban settings, jointly organised by Singapore and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
While the work on preparedness started before Covid-19, the pandemic has magnified the role that urban settings play in health emergencies, Mr Ong said.","big, work, preparedness, urban, ye, prepares, singapore, questions, health, kung, pandemic, whos, settings, world, ong",Human health crises,pandemic

Still, each spillover represents an opportunity for viral adaptation that could lead to a Covid-like outbreak.
""This is probably the first attempt to estimate how often people are infected with Sars-related coronaviruses from bats,"" said Mr Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who was not involved in the research.
Humans are continually exposed to bat coronaviruses, he said.

Among other criteria, they must also not have previously been infected with Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, or Sars-CoV-1, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Individuals in the first will receive a third dose of an mRNA vaccine they had previously taken, such as Moderna.
Covaxin is an inactivated virus vaccine, which uses a version of the virus that has been disabled to teach the body to fight Sars-CoV-2.

But after a booster jab, the protective quality of the antibodies is almost equal to full vaccination plus infection.
The vaccine used was the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, and protection was measured based on the quantity and binding quality of antigens in the subjects' blood.
The study found that infection alone may not give sufficient protection, but it provided superior immunity for vaccinated people when compared with an additional dose of vaccine.
Similarly, someone who had two doses and got infected had better protection than someone with three jabs.","antibodies, person, quality, researchers, dose, infected, covid19, vaccinated, protection, mrna, study, infection, vaccine, vaccination, gets, jab, potent",Human health crises,pandemic
