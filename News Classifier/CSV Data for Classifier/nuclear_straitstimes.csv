Diana Toebbe, 46, admitted taking part in her husband Jonathan Toebbe's plan to sell information on US nuclear submarines to an unidentified foreign buyer.
But last week Jonathan Toebbe, 43, pleaded guilty to the same charge, and in doing so admitted his wife took part in the plot.
Jonathan Toebbe was a nuclear engineer for the US Navy dealing with nuclear submarine propulsion systems when the two were arrested on October 9, 2021 after he hid a small SD card carrying US secrets at a dead drop location in West Virginia.
One of the Toebbes' communications indicated that English might not be the country's native tongue, and others suggest that the country's navy is familiar with nuclear propulsion technology.","toebbes, pleads, engineer, husband, information, navy, secrets, guilty, wife, plot, countrys, submarine, toebbe, nuclear, sub, pleaded",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

On Monday, North Korea conducted its fourth missile test this year, following two launches of ""hypersonic missiles"" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and another one involving a railway-borne missile system.
""The North Korean nuclear and missile problem has not disappeared and will only grow worse in the absence of active, serious diplomacy,"" he said.","warns, states, politburo, weapons, tests, north, moratorium, united, testing, mr, korea, nuclear, missile, rethink",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

36,Dec-21,BERLIN (AFP) ,Germany to close nuclear reactors despite energy crisis,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/germany-to-close-nuclear-reactors-despite-energy-crisis,"BERLIN (AFP) - Germany will shut down three nuclear power plants on Friday (Dec 31) even as Europe faces one of its worst ever energy crises, following former chancellor Angela Merkel's timetable for phasing out atomic energy.
The move will halve remaining nuclear capacity in Germany and reduce energy output by around four gigawatts - equivalent to the power produced by 1,000 wind turbines.
Protests over the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 prompted Dr Merkel to set the wheels in motion for abandoning nuclear power just over 10 years ago.
But with energy prices soaring across Europe, the timing of the plans coming to fruition could hardly be worse.
The end of nuclear power in Germany will likely push prices up even further, according to Dr Sebastian Herold, a professor of energy policy at the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.","tensions, reactors, close, power, europe, term, gas, germany, despite, prices, nuclear, russia, energy, crisis",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

The strains were evident all week as the Biden administration sought to bring the alliance with Israel into a united front about how to deal with Iran over the next year.
Administration officials also outlined new efforts to tighten, rather than loosen, sanctions on Iran.
But the tougher line was also aimed at calming increasingly frustrated Israeli officials.

""What is going well, is unity with our European partners, greater alignment with China and Russia,"" said Mr Sullivan.
Progress in Vienna has remained stalled while Iran has continued to ramp up nuclear enrichment activities that leave it ever closer to having weapons-grade uranium.

The spectre of Chernobyl and Fukushima, along with the enduring problem of nuclear waste, kept energy generated by splitting atoms on the sidelines, even if that energy was virtually carbon-free.

The company hopes to build 16 of the plants, known as small modular reactors, and said each could power around a million homes.
The British government will contribute a grant of £210 million to develop the plants, while Rolls-Royce and its partners, including Exelon Generation, a US nuclear power company, and BNF Resources, a private company, would together invest £195 million over three years.
The government is looking for sources of clean power to replace Britain's ageing nuclear plants, although the Rolls-Royce models are unlikely to come online for at least a decade.","power, build, hopes, britain, million, reduce, plans, billion, nuclear, small, plants, rollsroyce, company",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility is almost entirely underground, protected by reinforced concrete covered with earth.
Under a 2015 deal with major powers, Iran agreed to strict limits on the quantity of uranium it enriches at the plant and the degree to which it enriches it.

A decade after triple meltdowns at Fukushima forced mass evacuations and a shut-down of the nuclear industry, Japan has restarted only a third of its 33 operable reactors.
Mr Amari said Japan must revert to nuclear power to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality pledge, avoid rapidly rising prices of imported coal and gas and to cut its reliance on other countries for energy needs.
He faces a tight race in his home district, where he is struggling to attract support from anti-nuclear junior coalition partner, Komeito.
Mr Ono cited local distrust caused by what he called multiple mishaps by the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Holdings (Tepco).","reactors, power, race, kishidas, resistance, election, ahead, party, mr, faces, tokyo, nuclear, push, plants, japan, antinuclear, restarted",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

But the report put particular emphasis on China's growing nuclear arsenal.
The United States has a stockpile of 3,750 nuclear warheads, of which 1,389 were deployed as of Sept 1.
Beijing has dismissed US fears over its military development, and on Thursday accused the Pentagon report of aiming to ""hype up talk of the China nuclear threat"".

Instead, he insisted, the United States and the United Kingdom had agreed to supply Australia with nuclear reactors, which would be expected to last for the lifespan of the vessels.","debate, power, deal, states, supply, vessels, submarines, united, australia, australias, prompts, decision, sydney, submarine, scott, nuclear",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

In its wake, North Korea, China's only treaty ally, conducted a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile into the waters off Japan.
Both developments are destabilising: While hypersonic missiles fly at about five times the speed of sound but are slower than ballistic missiles, their menace comes from being more manoeuvrable in flight and hence difficult to track and destroy.

This arrogant and self-righteous response is a vivid revelation of the American-style double-dealing attitude,"" Mr Kim said.
Mr Kim said Washington was to blame for the stand-off preventing the restart of talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals in return for sanctions relief.
North Korea has been steadily developing its weapons systems, raising the stakes for the negotiations that were initiated between Mr Kim Jong Un and former US president Donald Trump in 2018 and have stalled since 2019.","korean, double, koreas, talks, north, kim, hampering, accuses, mr, south, standards, korea, missiles, nuclear, missile, test",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

But Japan still relies heavily on fossil fuels, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal, which have to be imported.

For China, the development of nuclear energy is essential to help it fulfil its promise of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and realising carbon neutrality before 2060.
Since energy cooperation has always been a pillar of their ties, it should really come as no surprise that the two countries are strengthening their cooperation in this area, especially since both countries are leading producers of nuclear energy technology.
Cooperation on nuclear energy projects brings about win-win results, and is in line with both countries' interests, as well the world's imperative need to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.

Under the nuclear deal, Iran is currently only allowed to use ""first-generation"" IR-1 centrifuges for production, and to test a limited number of IR-4 and IR-5 devices.
Iran has demanded that the United States first lift all sanctions imposed by Mr Trump, including a sweeping unilateral ban on its oil exports, before it falls back in line with obligations it suspended.

""The emphasis on using 'other options' against (Iran) amounts to threatening another country illegally and establishes Iran's right to reciprocate ... against 'available options',"" Mr Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said on Twitter.
Mr Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in White House talks on Friday that he was putting ""diplomacy first"" to try to rein in Iran's nuclear programme but that if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei drew a parallel on Saturday between the Biden administration's approach to the nuclear accord to that of former President Donald Trump, who withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
Mr Trump's withdrawal from the accord aimed to pressure Iran into negotiating stricter curbs on its nuclear programme, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces.","illegally, talks, threatened, biden, threatening, teheran, options, official, irans, mr, iran, trump, nuclear, president, security",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster
257,Feb-21,"VIENNA • The United Nations nuclear watchdog said it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Teheran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi on Sunday, made after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Teheran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency today.

Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since the United States, under former president Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.

The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms.

US President Joe Biden has said he wants to talk about both nations returning to the accord, though the two sides have been at odds about who makes the first step.

Teheran over the weekend renewed its demand that the US rejoin the accord and lift its crippling sanctions on Iran before talks can resume.

A key part of Iran's plan for reducing cooperation is to end implementation of the additional protocol, under which Teheran allows the IAEA to carry out unannounced inspections of nuclear material and installations where undeclared activity is suspected.

""The additional protocol, much to my regret, is going to be suspended,"" Mr Grossi said.

While the IAEA can still enter Iran to account for declared nuclear stockpiles, oversight of places such as machine shops and mines involved in uranium enrichment will be lost, as will camera surveillance of Iranian nuclear sites.

The IAEA and Teheran earlier issued a joint statement saying Iran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.

The IAEA will also continue ""necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months"", the statement said, without specifying what those activities are.

The aim was to reach an agreement within two months, said a senior official with the European Union, the coordinator of the deal.
Former US President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran, prompting Teheran to violate some of the pact's nuclear restrictions.
The talks will seek to create negotiating lists of sanctions that the United States could lift and nuclear obligations Iran should meet, the EU official said.

Mr Chung is the first South Korean prime minister to visit Iran in 44 years amid icy relations between the two countries due to Iran's military cooperation with North Korea.
Tension rose after Iran seized a South Korean ship and its sailors in the Strait of Hormuz in January, accusing them of polluting the waters, and demanded that Seoul release US$7 billion in assets frozen in South Korean banks under US sanctions.
Iran and world powers held talks last week aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal that former US president Donald Trump abandoned three years ago.

Many people now seem perplexed or angered by the Moon government's possible bid to build a nuclear power plant in the North while domestically adhering to a nuclear phaseout policy.
A spokesperson for Mr Moon immediately rebuffed Mr Kim's statement as irresponsible and misleading, pledging to take legal measures against him.

It said the investigation was able to reassess the thyroid exposure to radioactive doses of the inhabitants of the Gambier Islands, Tureia and Tahiti during the six nuclear tests considered to be the most contaminating in the history of French tests in the Pacific.

The reaction highlighted the challenges in ending an impasse that has threatened to tip the Persian Gulf region into a new conflict in the years since former president Donald Trump exited the accord and reimposed sanctions.

In an effort to make good on one of US President Joe Biden's most significant campaign promises, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with European foreign ministers and agreed that the deal with Iran ""was a key achievement of multilateral diplomacy"", and one worth pursuing again.

Mr Biden has said he would lift the sanctions imposed by Mr Trump if Iran returned to the sharp limits on nuclear production that it observed until 2019.

Iran has said the US was the first to violate the terms of the accord, and that it would act only after Washington reversed course and allowed it to sell oil and conduct banking operations.

Iran's announcement will open what is likely to be a delicate set of diplomatic offerings.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the federal law 'on the ratification of the extension of the agreement between Russia and the USA',"" the Kremlin said in a statement, referring to New Start.
The New Start treaty is the last remaining arms reduction pact between the former Cold War rivals.

386,Jan-21,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON • Russia and the United States have struck a deal to extend the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear arms control treaty, the Kremlin said, a move that preserves the last major pact of its kind between the world's two biggest nuclear powers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that the extension of the pact was a positive development in reducing global tensions, as Russian lawmakers unanimously voted to ratify the agreement, in a rare moment of cooperation between Moscow and Washington.

""No doubt it is a step in the right direction,"" Mr Putin said at the World Economic Forum summit being held virtually this year, addressing the body for the first time since 2009.

But the Russian leader warned: ""The situation can still develop unpredictably and uncontrollably if we sit on our hands.""

Earlier yesterday, 399 Russian lawmakers in Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, voted in favour of extending the agreement, with no votes against or abstentions. The upper house ratified the treaty extension later yesterday.

Mr Putin submitted a Bill extending the accord after the Russian leader and new US President Joe Biden held their first phone call on Tuesday evening. The treaty was set to expire on Feb 5.

Signed in 2010, the New Start is a cornerstone of global arms control. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the US and Russia to 1,550 each, as well as the number of land",Putin hails extension of Russia-US nuclear arms pact as a positive step,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/putin-hails-extension-of-russia-us-nuclear-arms-pact-as-a-positive-step,"MOSCOW/WASHINGTON • Russia and the United States have struck a deal to extend the New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear arms control treaty, the Kremlin said, a move that preserves the last major pact of its kind between the world's two biggest nuclear powers.

Spy agencies in recent weeks circulated a classified analysis about the efforts underway inside Saudi Arabia - working with China - to build industrial capacity to produce nuclear fuel.
Even if the kingdom has decided to pursue a military nuclear programme, they said, it would be years before it could have the ability to produce a single nuclear warhead.
Saudi officials have made no secret of their determination to keep pace with Iran, which has accelerated since US President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal with Teheran.
Last week, the House Intelligence Committee included a provision in the intelligence budget authorisation bill requiring the administration to submit a report about Saudi efforts since 2015 to develop a nuclear programme.","weapons, produce, examines, officials, kingdom, programme, uranium, intelligence, arabia, nuclear, efforts, lead, saudi",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

Iran had previously only reached 20 per cent purity, and that was already a breach of the deal, which says Iran can only enrich to 3.67 per cent.
Iran made the step up to 60 per cent in response to an explosion that damaged equipment at the larger, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz.

Japan unveiled plans on Tuesday to release more than one million tonnes of water from the plant crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami into the sea once it had been treated.
South Korea strongly protested against the decision, summoning Mr Koichi Aiboshi, Tokyo's Ambassador in Seoul, and convening an intra-agency emergency meeting to craft its response.
Mr Moon also expressed concerns about the decision as Mr Aiboshi presented his credentials, having arrived in South Korea in February for the ambassador's post.

In his new book, titled Rage, Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward wrote that the US had devised plans for a possible armed clash with North Korea, such as ""the US response to an attack that could include the use of 80 nuclear weapons"".
The passage fuelled debate in South Korea over whether it meant Washington or Pyongyang would detonate 80 bombs against each other.

412,Oct-20,"TEHERAN • Iran yesterday said a longstanding UN embargo on arms sales to and from the Islamic Republic has expired, in line with a 2015 landmark nuclear agreement with world powers from which the US has withdrawn.

Teheran, which could now purchase weapons from Russia, China and elsewhere, has hailed the development as a diplomatic victory over its arch enemy, Washington, which had tried to maintain an indefinite freeze on arms sales.

""As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran... are all automatically terminated,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement sent out on Twitter.

The embargo on the sale of conventional arms to Iran was due to start expiring progressively from yesterday under the terms of the UN resolution that blessed the 2015 nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and world powers.

""As of today, the Islamic Republic may procure any necessary arms and equipment from any source without any legal restrictions, and solely based on its defensive needs,"" the ministry added.

It insisted that under the terms of the deal, struck with the United States, China, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, ""the lifting of arms restrictions and the travel ban were designed to be automatic with no other action required"".

US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the nuclear deal in 2018 and has unilaterally begun reimposing sanctions on Iran. But Washington suffered a setback in August when it failed to win support from the United Nations Security Council to indefinitely extend the arms embargo.

It was ""a momentous day for the international community"", the Iranian ministry said yesterday, adding that the world had stood with Teheran ""in defiance of the US regime's efforts"".

The push sets up a new confrontation at the Security Council, where European allies are resisting the so-called snapback sanctions in a last-ditch attempt to hold together the fraying 2015 accord.
""The enforcement mechanisms will be just the same enforcement mechanisms we have for all of the UN Security Council resolutions,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference.
The Trump administration had for months warned that it would seek to trigger the UN sanctions if an arms embargo against Iran was allowed to expire in October, as scheduled under the nuclear deal.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, flanked by other top members of President Donald Trump's national security team, also told reporters that Washington had imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has forged closer ties between Caracas and Teheran.

""For nearly two years, corrupt officials in Teheran have worked with the illegitimate regime in Venezuela to flout the UN arms embargo,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""Our actions today are a warning that should be heard worldwide.""

Mr Pompeo said that Mr Trump has issued an executive order ""that is a new and powerful tool to enforce the UN arms embargo"".

He did not offer details on what the US sanctions were.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who appeared with Mr Pompeo, also announced separate sanctions on the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran.

The US has triggered a ""snap back"", or resumption, of virtually all UN sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, to come into effect at 8pm on Saturday.

A major part of Washington's new push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms.

Under the 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States had unilaterally pulled out of in 2018, the UN conventional arms embargo is set to expire on Oct 18.

Other parties to the nuclear deal and most United Nations Security Council members have said they do not believe the US has the right to reimpose the UN sanctions and that Washington's move has no legal effect.

The move yesterday freezes any US assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them, while extending secondary sanctions to those who do business with them. This means foreign banks risk losing access to the US market and financial system.

The Treasury Department said in a statement the prohibitions did not apply to transactions to sell agricultural commodities, food, medicine or medical devices to Iran, saying it understood the need for humanitarian goods.

493,Aug-20,"UNITED NATIONS • A controversial bid by the United States to reimpose international sanctions on Iran has been blocked by the United Nations, with the Security Council saying it could not proceed with the disputed move.

The presidency of the UN Security Council, assumed this month by Indonesia, is ""not in a position to take further action"" on Washington's request, said ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani on Tuesday.

In a video conference on the Middle East, the Indonesian diplomat cited the lack of consensus in the UN's highest body on the US strategy as the main reason.

The Trump administration accuses Teheran of failing to comply with the terms of the historic 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and is demanding the Security Council reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Washington insists on its legal right to trigger the disputed procedure, called ""snapback"", despite pulling out of the deal two years ago.

The move threatens to torpedo the Iran accord and plunge the Security Council into crisis, while widening the gulf between the US and almost every other member on Iran policy. Thirteen of the 15 Council members had written to the Indonesian presidency to reject its validity.

The US ""is alone"" in the approach, and its ""ultimate goal is to destroy the nuclear agreement when it has already imposed (national) sanctions on Iran"", a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP. Another said that with the sound rejection of the US bid by almost the entire council, ""normally the matter is closed"".

The US did not see it that way. ""We reminded members of our right under Resolution 2231 to trigger snapback, and our firm intent to do so in the absence of courage and moral clarity by the council,"" said US ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft.

The move, never before used, comes after the US suffered a humiliating defeat at the Security Council earlier this month when it failed to muster support for a resolution to extend a conventional arms embargo on Iran. According to the 2015 agreement, in which sanctions against Iran were lifted in exchange for it agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons, a notification that Teheran has broken its promise must in principle be followed by a draft resolution by the presidency of the Security Council.

The exclusion of this option by Indonesia was welcomed on Tuesday by most of the Council members.

The Iranian mission to the UN welcomed the council's rejection of the US move. Iran said the US request, ""including all references therein, are null and void, have no legal standing and effect and are thus completely inadmissible"".

The New Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord, signed in 2010, limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers that Russia and the United States can deploy.
A failure to extend the pact would remove all constraints on US and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, fuelling a post-Cold War arms race and tensions between Moscow and Washington.
Russia and the United States, which has called for China to be included in the arms control treaty, have appeared at odds over extending the pact despite several months of talks.

540,Jan-20,"DUBAI • Iranian President Hassan Rouhani yesterday dismissed a proposal for a new ""Trump deal"" aimed at resolving a nuclear row, saying it was a ""strange"" offer and criticising US President Donald Trump for always breaking promises.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Tuesday for the US leader to replace Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers with his own new pact to ensure Teheran does not get an atomic weapon. Mr Trump said he agreed with Mr Johnson that a ""Trump deal"" should replace the Iran nuclear deal.

In a televised speech, Mr Rouhani urged Washington to return to the nuclear pact, which the US abandoned in 2018.

Teheran has gradually taken steps to reduce its compliance with the deal, which prompted Britain, France and Germany to formally accuse it on Tuesday of violating the terms.

""This Mr Prime Minister in London, I don't know how he thinks. He says let's put aside the nuclear deal and put the Trump plan in action,"" Mr Rouhani said.

""If you take the wrong step, it will be to your detriment. Pick the right path. The right path is to return to the nuclear deal.""

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Reuters that the nuclear deal was still alive.

""No, it's not dead. It's not dead,"" Mr Zarif said on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi.

But he told the conference that Mr Trump's withdrawal from the earlier deal made new negotiations with Washington pointless.

564,Jun-19,STOCKHOLM (AFP) ,'Fewer but newer' nuclear arms in the world: Report,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/fewer-but-newer-nuclear-arms-in-the-world-report,"STOCKHOLM (AFP) - The overall number of nuclear warheads in the world has declined in the past year but nations are modernising their arsenals, a report published Monday (June 17) said.
That represents a decrease of 600 nuclear weapons compared to the start of 2018.
But at the same time all nuclear weapon-possessing countries are modernising these arms - and China, India and Pakistan are also increasing the size of their arsenals.
""The world is seeing fewer but newer weapons,"" Shannon Kile, director of the SIPRI Nuclear Arms Control Programme and one of the report's authors, told Agence France-Presse.
The drop in recent years can mainly be attributed to the US and Russia, whose combined arsenals still make up more than 90 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons.","fewer, start, report, weapons, newer, warheads, stockholm, number, russia, nuclear, pakistan, arms, world",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster
565,Jul-19,"Iran's main audience for those moves are the European powers who signed the deal and still support it. By gradually restarting their nuclear programme in staggered increments, Iran's leaders hope to pressure the Europeans to provide help evading the US sanctions, or at least to drive a wedge between the Europeans and Mr Trump.

They said over the weekend that they plan to push ever further over the limits of the nuclear deal in leaps every 60 days unless Western governments honour their end of the bargain.

Iran could also retaliate against the US with conventional military force.

Tehran demonstrated its capabilities last month by shooting down an American surveillance drone flying at high altitude. And the US has also blamed Iran for using naval mines to damage six petroleum tankers in two attacks in the waters around the Persian Gulf.

But direct attacks against the US risk retaliation ",The Iran crisis: How we got there and what's next,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/the-iran-crisis-how-we-got-there-and-whats-next,"But direct attacks against the US risk retaliation - Mr Trump only narrowly aborted a missile strike for the downing of the drone.
Iran may hope that Americans will elect a new president in 2020 who could revive the deal.
Each step Iran takes past the deal's limits increases the risk that the European countries might restore their own sanctions, effectively nullifying the accord.
Either by accelerating its nuclear progress or violent retaliation, directly or through allies, Iran raises the risk of US military action.

566,Dec-19,"TOKYO • Iranian President Hassan Rouhani renewed his condemnation of the US yesterday for withdrawing from a nuclear agreement, and asked for Japan's help in efforts to maintain the deal as the two leaders met in Tokyo amid an impasse between Teheran and Washington.

Mr Rouhani, the first Iranian president to visit Japan in 19 years, told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the nuclear agreement with world powers is very important and that Washington's unilateral withdrawal was ""unreasonable"".

Mr Abe, in his opening remarks, urged Iran to fully comply with the agreement and play a constructive role in achieving peace and stability in the region. He expressed concern about rising tensions in the Middle East and pledged to do as much as possible to help restore regional stability.

The Middle East supplies more than 80 per cent of Japan's oil.

Japan, a US ally that has traditionally had friendly relations with Iran, also seeks to serve as a mediator between Teheran and Washington. Mr Abe has said that such a role is expected by the international community.

Mr Rouhani, who was in Malaysia earlier for an Islamic conference, arrived in Tokyo yesterday afternoon for an overnight visit to meet Mr Abe and have dinner with him, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said.

Tensions have escalated between Teheran and Washington since President Donald Trump's decision last year to withdraw from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal.

Mr Abe, who has developed friendly ties with Mr Trump, travelled to Iran in June in an unsuccessful effort to encourage Iran and the US to hold talks to reduce tensions.

Iran's foreign minister told reporters in New York that Iran could immediately ratify a document prescribing more intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme if the US abandoned its economic sanctions, media organisations reported.
The document, known as the Additional Protocol, gives UN inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) more tools to verify that a nuclear programme is peaceful.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal agreed to by Teheran, Iran must seek ratification of the protocol eight years after the deal was adopted.

The suspension of uranium enrichment at the long secret plant was one of the restrictions Iran had agreed to on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of UN sanctions.
Iran's announcement that it would resume enrichment at the Fordow plant from midnight had drawn a chorus of concern from the remaining parties to the troubled agreement.
The resumption of enrichment at Fordow is Iran's fourth move away from the deal.

But the Americans argued that decommissioning Yongbyon did not suffice, calling for Pyongyang to transfer nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the US.

North Korea had also said it dismantled its Sohae missile launch site as an initial step toward denuclearisation, but the facility was used on Sunday (Dec 8) for what Pyongyang said was a ""very significant test"".

North Korea has stepped up calls for the US to end joint military drills with South Korea, as well as retracting its ""hostile policy"" including criticising Pyongyang's human rights record.

'COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE'

US officials came to Stockholm seeking a ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"" of North Korea, and pushed for a moratorium on weapons tests as a first step, a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Although some media reports said the US had planned to propose temporarily lifting sanctions on coal and textile exports, the source said the Stockholm talks did not get into details.

Washington and Seoul have contemplated possible areas where sanctions be eased on the condition they can be immediately put back if needed, such as a resumption of South Korean tours to the North.

North Korea, in contrast, has sought a ""systematic guarantee"" for the lifting of sanctions, singling out five UN resolutions at the Hanoi summit, the source said.

The five UN resolutions, adopted in 2016 and 2017, chiefly limited North Korea's mineral exports and banned financial transactions, which were expected to prevent Pyongyang from earning at least US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) a year.

""But the Americans can't take the risk of easing sanctions first, having already given a lot of gifts to Kim without substantial progress on denuclearisation, including summits,"" the source said.

""Sanctions are basically all they have to press North Korea.""

US negotiators tried to fix a date for the next round of talks when the Stockholm meeting fell apart, but North Korean officials were uncooperative, the source said.

586,Nov-19,"TOKYO • Japan's Tohoku Electric Power said yesterday it has won initial regulatory approval to restart a reactor at its Onagawa power plant, more than eight years after it was damaged in the earthquake and tsunami that caused the Fukushima disaster.

Tohoku Electric said in a statement it has received a preliminary green light from Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority to restart the No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, subject to a public consultation period.

Onagawa was the closest among Japan's nuclear stations to the epicentre of the magnitude",Initial nod for restart of Japan nuclear reactor nearest 2011 quake epicentre,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/initial-nod-for-restart-of-japan-nuclear-reactor-nearest-2011-quake-epicentre,"Tohoku Electric said in a statement it has received a preliminary green light from Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority to restart the No.

The reactor is a boiling water reactor (BWR) with the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis.
2 reactor will save the utility company 35 billion yen each year in fuel costs, it said.
The Fukushima disaster led to the eventual shutdown of the country's then 54 operational reactors, which once provided nearly a third of Japan's electricity.","electric, 2011, disaster, reactor, yen, nod, restart, fukushima, initial, epicentre, japans, tsunami, billion, nuclear, nearest, japan, onagawa, quake",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster

Limiting the volume and purity of its accumulated uranium was a central part of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2015.
While Mr Trump announced the sanctions - days after Iran shot down a US Navy drone - he did not provide details.
In his Twitter post, Mr Trump specified the need to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, echoing comments made to reporters at the White House on Saturday.

598,Dec-19,"MOSCOW • A new intercontinental weapon that can fly at 27 times the speed of sound has become operational, Russia's defence minister reported to President Vladimir Putin, bolstering the country's nuclear strike capability.

Mr Putin has described the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle as a technological breakthrough comparable to the 1957 Soviet launch of the first satellite.

The new Russian weapon and a similar system being developed by China have troubled the United States, which has pondered defence strategies.

The Avangard is launched atop an intercontinental ballistic missile, but unlike a regular missile warhead that follows a predictable path after separation, it can make sharp manoeuvres in the atmosphere en route to target, making it much harder to intercept.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed Mr Putin that the first missile unit equipped with the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle entered combat duty on Friday. ""I congratulate you on this landmark event for the military and the entire nation,"" he said later during a conference call with military leaders.

The Strategic Missile Forces chief, General Sergei Karakayev, said during the call that the Avangard was put on duty with a unit in the Orenburg region in the southern Ural Mountains.

Mr Putin unveiled the Avangard among other prospective weapons systems in his state",New Russian weapon travels at 27 times the speed of sound,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/new-russian-weapon-travels-at-27-times-the-speed-of-sound,"MOSCOW • A new intercontinental weapon that can fly at 27 times the speed of sound has become operational, Russia's defence minister reported to President Vladimir Putin, bolstering the country's nuclear strike capability.
The military said the Avangard is capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound.
It carries a nuclear weapon of up to 2 megatons.
The Russian military previously had commissioned another hypersonic weapon of a smaller range.
US officials have talked about putting a layer of sensors in space to more quickly detect enemy missiles, particularly the hypersonic weapons.","hypersonic, speed, weapon, weapons, military, travels, 27, nuclear, sound, times, avangard, defence, russian, missile, putin",Man-Made Disaster,Man-Made Disaster
