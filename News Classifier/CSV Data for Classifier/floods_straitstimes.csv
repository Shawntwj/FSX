But Bild newspaper condemned the ""failure"" to take early action in the battered states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North-Rhine Westphalia.
Gerd Landsberg, head of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, called for an overhaul of the early warning system.
Minister for Research Anja Karliczek said Germany must prepare better for natural disasters, expected to become more frequent because of climate change.","questions, states, system, civil, warning, sirens, germany, weather, rhinelandpalatinate, protection, flood, told, deadly",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

The catastrophic floods that hit north-west Europe this month have heightened concerns that even in some of the world's richest countries, infrastructure is ill prepared to cope with climate change as once-rare weather events become more common.
Developers seeking cash from some EU funds are required to ensure projects like roads, railways and power plants in the 27-member bloc can cope with extreme weather events.
The assessment should also calculate the project's expected greenhouse gas emissions to see if it is compatible with EU climate goals, including the bloc's target to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
The EU's aim is to ensure bridges, railways and power stations built today can withstand the impact of a hotter planet - and avoid locking in decades of emissions that would thwart climate change goals.","commission, proof, cope, weather, checklist, risks, infrastructure, change, eu, creates, projects, eus, emissions, climate, european",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

With Singapore experiencing more floods recently, I wonder if there are sufficient measures to prevent tall machinery such as pile drivers or cranes from floating in flood waters, and consequently toppling?

Are operators required to retract the booms and have them in their horizontal resting positions at the end of each workday and during heavy rain? These heavy machinery can pose serious danger to human lives and damage surrounding structures if they topple.

QUAD SHOULD INVITE CHINA TO JOIN IT

The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad), a strategic dialogue between the United States, Japan, Australia and India, is now concerned with boosting the production capacity of vaccines, supply chains and climate change (Conflict with China not inevitable: US officials, Aug 25).

China is one of the largest vaccine donors and is at the top of the global supply chain. The importance of China's cooperation in fighting climate change is widely acknowledged. It therefore makes sense for the Quad to invite China to join it.

In this phase, the IOD brings more rain than usual to countries in the eastern end of the Indian Ocean basin, including Singapore.
The weather phenomenon is associated with changes in atmospheric pressure and sea surface temperature across the Indian Ocean.
In the negative phase, the winds blowing towards the eastern end of the Indian Ocean intensify.

411,20-Nov,"Singapore experienced flash floods at three locations on Monday (Nov 2). One car was seen submerged. ST answers questions on what to do if your car is near a flash flood.

Q. How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?

It depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, said The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.

Generally, it is not safe to drive through a flood. A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120 to 140mm, which is not very high.

But if necessary, one should gauge the water depth by looking at the road curbs. If the curbs are still visible or just below water level, it is relatively safe to proceed.

If the curb is not visible, it is riskier to proceed unless you are in a tall vehicle like an SUV or a truck. Otherwise, you may end up driving into a drain, canal or over a ledge.

Q. What should I do when driving on a submerged road?

Drive very slowly and steadily in a low gear to keep your engine speed high and constant until your car is out of the water, suggests the Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS).

This prevents water from entering the exhaust pipe, which will damage electronics. Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

To avoid stopping in the middle of the flood, allow oncoming traffic as well as vehicles going in the same direction to pass.

Do not lift your foot or apply brakes midway to minimise turbulence and backflow that can lead to water intake.

After clearing the flooded area, apply the brakes gently for a few minutes to rid them of moisture, which may have impacted their performance.

Q. What should I do if my car stalls while driving through a flash flood?

Do not attempt to restart it as that may damage the engine, said the AAS.

Ensure the car's bonnet is closed because you may have difficulty restarting the engine.

Switch on the hazard lights to alert other drivers around you and call for help",askST: What do I do if my car is caught in a flash flood?,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ask-st-what-do-i-do-if-my-car-is-caught-in-a-flash-flood,"ST answers questions on what to do if your car is near a flash flood.

415,21-Jan,"The prices of vegetables and fish are going up across the board at wet markets in Singapore, with some vegetables costing about twice as much as they were just weeks ago.

The Straits Times visited five wet markets yesterday and vendors said poor weather conditions in Malaysia have caused a shortage of supplies as farms are flooded, resulting in poor crop output.

Transport is also an issue because roads are closed due to the severe flooding.

Mr Alex Zhou, 35, who runs a vegetable stall at the wet market in Pasir Ris Drive 6, said: ""The constant rain in Malaysia has made it hard to transport goods, and we've lost a lot of supply due to the poor weather. Green leafy vegetables like spinach are more affected because they spoil easily in water.""

A vegetable stallholder at Geylang Serai Market, who wanted to be known only as Madam Rashidah, 45, and who runs the business with her husband, said: ""I had to get vegetables from Thailand and Vietnam, which are flown in. This method is more expensive, causing my prices to go up as well.""

Severe flooding in Malaysia over the past few weeks has resulted in tens of thousands of people being evacuated from their homes. Over 48,000 in six states were sheltering in 400 relief centres last Friday.

At the Pasir Ris and Ghim Moh markets, prices of tomatoes have almost doubled, from about $1 to $2 per kilogram to about $3 per kilogram.

A market vendor at Tekka Market said his cost price for tomatoes has more than doubled from $12 per 10kg to $28, while a vendor in Pasir Ris said his supplies now cost $32 per 10kg, up from about $10.

About 178,000 homes have been submerged by floodwaters, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with rescuers mounting a desperate bid to get food and drinking water to those cut off.

Roads, infrastructure and crops in the central region have also been devastated, the charity added, warning that hundreds of thousands would need housing and income support in the coming weeks.

Ms Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu of the Vietnam Red Cross Society said the floods are ""some of the worst we have seen in decades"".

At least 111 people have been killed, the disaster management authority said, while nearly 200,000 have been evacuated.

Among those dead are 22 soldiers who were engulfed in a landslide on Sunday in Quang Tri province, and 13 rescuers who had tried to save workers from a hydropower plant.

A search team is still trying to find 15 of the missing plant workers, who were also caught in a landslide.

Although floodwaters have begun to recede in some areas, images on state media showed villages across the region that were still submerged and a hospital badly flooded in Quang Binh, with water pooling around its beds.

Meanwhile, more rain is forecast to hit the area over the weekend as Storm Saudel blows in from the South China Sea.

434,20-Nov,"TEGUCIGALPA • The remnants of Hurricane Eta have unleashed torrential rain and catastrophic flooding on Central America, with fatalities sharply up mostly because of mudslides as streets turned into rivers and bridges came tumbling down.

More than 70 people were reported killed across the region of mostly poor countries wedged between Mexico and Colombia, and at least hundreds were stranded on rooftops or cut off by floods.

In Guatemala, the death toll shot up past 50 over the course of Thursday, according to President Alejandro Giammattei, who said mudslides around a couple of small towns swallowed about two dozen homes.

""Right now, we're trying to get there on foot because there's no other way,"" said Mr Giammattei, referring to flooded out roads that complicated rescue efforts.

One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday, with winds of 241 kmh before weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland and into neighbouring Honduras.

Families waded through flooded streets of the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, while cars sat almost submerged in parts of the central Guatemalan city of San Pedro Carcha, TV footage and images on social media showed.

Overall, eight fatalities were confirmed in Honduras, as more than 5,000 people were holed up in shelters, while 63 communities were cut off from communications, according to the government. Officials said 20 bridges there had been destroyed.

A video posted on social media showed one of the bridges, spanning the Ulua River just east of San Pedro Sula, disappearing into the waterway after a raging torrent pulled it down.

The government said about 500 people were rescued from their roofs in Honduras on Thursday as water levels continued to rise, but many others were likely still stranded.

""We will not leave the area until we rescue the last person,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told the media, adding that rescue efforts led by police, soldiers and firefighters will continue overnight.

Damage and destruction had spread across most of Honduras and speedboats and helicopters would be sent to take people to safety in inaccessible areas, he said earlier in the day.

Media in Nicaragua also reported two miners had been killed in a mudslide.

Mr Giammattei had already declared a state of emergency in nearly half of Guatemala's 22 departments.

In southern Costa Rica, a landslide killed two people in a house, officials said.

Meanwhile, five people, including three children, died in flooding in Panama's Chiriqui province, near the Costa Rica border, the authorities said.

There was at least one silver lining in Honduras, where 60 fishermen who disappeared at sea on Tuesday returned after taking shelter on cays until they were rescued, said community leader Robin Morales.

Calling their survival a ""miracle,"" Mr Morales said a man among them presumed dead from a heart attack also made it back.

""Our friends are alive, thank God,"" he said.

435,20-Nov,"Q How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?

A This depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, says The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.

Generally, it is not safe to drive through a flood. A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120mm to 140mm, which is not very high.

But, if necessary, one should gauge the water depth by looking at the road kerbs.

If the kerbs are still visible or just below water level, it is relatively safe to proceed.

If the kerbs are not visible, it is riskier to proceed unless you are in a tall vehicle like a sport utility vehicle or a lorry. Otherwise, you may end up driving into a drain, canal or over a ledge.

Q What should I do when driving on a submerged road?

A Drive very slowly and steadily in a low gear to keep your engine speed high and constant until your car is out of the water, suggests the Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS).

This prevents water from entering the exhaust pipe, which would damage the electronics.

Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

Where possible, flooded roads are best negotiated one vehicle at a time. Allow all oncoming traffic and vehicles going in the same direction to pass so as to avoid having to stop in the middle of the flood. Do not lift your foot or apply brakes midway to minimise turbulence and back flow that can lead to water intake.

After clearing the flooded area, apply the brakes gently for a few minutes to rid them of moisture, which could impact their performance.

Q What should I do if my car stalls while driving through a flash flood?

A Do not attempt to restart it as that may damage the engine, says the AAS.

Ensure that the car's bonnet is closed because you may have difficulty restarting the engine.

Switch on the hazard lights to alert other drivers around you and call for help",What do I do if my car is caught in a flash flood?,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-do-i-do-if-my-car-is-caught-in-a-flash-flood,"Q How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?
A This depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, says The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.
A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120mm to 140mm, which is not very high.
Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

Rains that began early Saturday on the island of Kyushu have already caused widespread damage across a swathe of the southwestern portion of the country, causing rivers to burst their banks and hillsides to collapse.

The weather front was moving north. Yesterday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued warnings in Gifu and Nagano prefectures in central Japan, though it downgraded the advisories from its top level by midday. ""In these areas, heavy rains are at an unprecedented level,"" a JMA official said at an early morning briefing.

""Especially in areas designated as high risk for landslides and flooding, the possibility is extremely high that some kind of disaster is already happening,"" he warned.

At least 80,000 rescue workers have been deployed in a desperate effort to reach survivors stranded by floods and landslides.

Late on Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to double the number of troops involved in the rescue effort to 20,000.

The toll in the disaster has risen steadily as rescue workers find new casualties.

Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said 52 deaths had been confirmed with three more people feared dead.

The toll is expected to rise, with more than a dozen people reported missing and the authorities investigating whether six additional deaths are linked to the disaster.

697,20-May,"KOLKATA/DHAKA • India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, peering down from his aircraft yesterday, saw the devastation and flooding caused by the most powerful cyclone to strike the country and its neighbour Bangladesh in more than a decade, before he landed in the stricken city of Kolkata.

Cyclone Amphan killed at least 96 people in the two countries after it swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. Most of those who died were in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.

The toll is expected to rise as communications are restored and the authorities reach villages cut off by blocked roads.

But the evacuation of about three million people before the cyclone struck undoubtedly reduced the number of casualties.

Mr Modi said the country stood with the people of West Bengal and announced emergency aid of 10 billion rupees (S$188 million) to help the state at a time when it and the rest of India are dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

""Dealing with the pandemic requires social distancing whereas battling the cyclone requires people to move to safer areas,"" Mr Modi said at a school during a stop on a tour to inspect the damage.

""Despite this, West Bengal is fighting well. We are all with West Bengal in these adverse times.""

Mr Modi wore a mask as he stepped onto the tarmac at the airport in Kolkata earlier and was greeted by the state's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other officials, all wearing masks.

Police are using drones to assess the damage in Kolkata, a city of 14 million people, where an estimated 10,000 trees were brought down during the storm that lasted several hours and led to extensive flooding.

Cyclone leaves trail of destruction

MAPUTO/HARARE • Mozambique started three days of national mourning yesterday after a powerful cyclone and flooding killed hundreds of people and left a trail of destruction across swathes of southeast Africa.

Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique's port city of Beira with winds of up to 170kmh last Thursday, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions of people in danger.

Drone footage showed residents of a shantytown at the port still picking through wreckage days after the storm hit and trying to drag plastic sheeting over their ruined homes.

The film, released by the Red Cross, showed the settlement pockmarked with empty plots where the winds had blown whole buildings from their foundations.

""Great floods have sowed mourning and devastation in various areas of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi,"" Pope Francis said yesterday. ""I express my pain and closeness to those dear people.""

Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi said a day earlier that the cyclone had killed more than 200 people in his country but rescuers were still discovering more bodies.

In neighbouring Zimbabwe, the official death count stands at 98 but is likely to grow as hundreds are still missing.

920,19-Mar,"CAIRNS (Queensland) • A ""very destructive"" category 4 cyclone slammed into Australia's remote northern coast yesterday, while a second, equally powerful storm bore down on the country's west.

Cyclone Trevor, pushing a big storm tide and packing winds of up to 250kmh, made landfall on the sparsely populated Northern Territory coast near the Gulf of Carpentaria town of Port McArthur, the Bureau of Meteorology reported.

The storm was downgraded to a category 3 shortly after making landfall, and was expected to weaken further as it travelled inland, though officials warned of heavy rains and flooding.

""There's a concern that flash flooding may occur,"" said emergency operations official Michael Hebb.

The army and police had already evacuated most residents from outposts in Trevor's path, many of them indigenous communities, though a handful of locals remained behind, police said.

There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries from the storm, but evacuated residents feared what they might find when they return home.

""We are only new to the area and the house we are in isn't going to sustain the expected winds that are predicted,"" said Port McArthur resident Emily Crawford, who was evacuated to the regional capital, Darwin. ""This is the scariest thing I've ever been through, I've never lived through even a flooding event, let alone a cyclone of this nature, I hope all my friends and neighbours are safe,"" she told AFP.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said Trevor was driving a ""very dangerous storm tide"" along the coastal regions and that heavy rainfall was expected to cause flooding across wide areas of the Northern Territory and neighbouring Queensland.

At a time when environmentalists are often pitted against agribusinesses in California's water wars, conservation scientists and rice farmers are working together, trying to reclaim the great flood plains of the Sacramento River for salmon habitat.
Now, for the cost and inconvenience of flooding their fields, rice farmers are earning goodwill and betting that a healthy salmon population will avoid new regulations to protect wildlife and keep adequate water flowing.
Before industrialisation, the northern end of California's Central Valley was a miles-wide flood plain straddling the Sacramento River - a natural feeding ground for fish.

As rising temperatures cause the leading edge - the tongue - of a glacier to melt, the retreating ice leaves behind deposits of rock debris.
Melt water from the glacier can then accumulate in the depression behind the dam, eventually forming a new lake.
If the tongue of the glacier extends into this lake, the ice flows twice as fast on average and it therefore melts faster too, according to the study financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.
If glaciers flow more rapidly, the water reserves stored in the ice will also be exhausted more rapidly and rivers will receive less water, the study explained.","water, accelerate, melt, tongue, study, permanent, glaciers, lake, quickly, ice, disappearance, glacier, lakes",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

1175,20-Nov,"In a matter of hours, swathes of the main Philippine island of Luzon were flooded by record downpours from Typhoon Vamco. Rivers burst their banks, landslides smashed into villages and rice fields were flattened. Much of the capital Manila was inundated by muddy water that quickly reached the rooftops of homes in some areas.

It is now just over a week since Vamco struck with unexpected ferocity, leaving many the painful task of cleaning up, rebuilding and mourning lost loved ones. The recovery for many has only just started.

The storm killed 73 people and affected nearly four million others, according to the latest update from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) published yesterday.

Vamco is the 21st storm to hit the Philippines this year and quickly followed Typhoon Goni, which was ranked as among the strongest typhoons to hit the country in years, with winds exceeding 300kmh. Goni left at least 26 dead and displaced close to a million.

The Philippines is used to typhoons. But this year, the season has been especially active, with Vietnam also being hit by a series of devastating storms.

The typhoon season usually starts in June and peters out by November. In recent years, however, the strongest typhoons have been slamming the country in November and December.

Vamco, which quickly gathered strength as it approached Luzon, dumped record levels of rain that paralysed nearly all of Metropolitan Manila two Thursdays ago. Dramatic rescues played out across several cities, with tens of thousands rescued by rubber dinghies, small motorised boats, canoes and even jet skis, Reuters reported at the time.

In Marikina City and nearby Rizal province, home to nearly three million, residents fled to the upper floors of their homes or climbed onto rooftops as flood waters rose rapidly after a 78km river breached its banks.

In Cagayan province, at the northern tip of Luzon, Vamco turned the once picturesque Cagayan River into a sea of murky brown, killing dozens and setting off deadly landslides.

1193,21-Feb,"NEW DELHI • Around 125 people are missing in northern India after a Himalayan glacier broke and swept away a small hydroelectric dam yesterday, with floods forcing the evacuation of villages downstream.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down the Dhauli Ganga river valley located in the state of Uttarakhand, more than 500km north of New Delhi.

""It came very fast; there was no time to alert anyone,"" Mr Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of the river in Raini village, said by phone. ""I felt that even we would be swept away.""

Earlier, the state's Chief Secretary Om Prakash said 100 to 150 people were feared dead. A large number of the missing were workers at the 13.2MW Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project, which was destroyed by the glacier.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters at a press conference in Dehradun, the state capital, that the number of missing could rise. The bodies of 10 people have been recovered so far.

Twelve people trapped in a tunnel have been rescued and efforts were under way to save others caught in another tunnel, the federal Home Ministry said after a meeting of the National Crisis Committee, comprising top officials.

With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with mud and rocks and paramilitary rescuers had to climb down a hillside using ropes to get access to the entrance.

Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing the massive burst of water tearing through a narrow valley below the power plant, leaving roads and bridges destroyed in its wake. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation. ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" Mr Modi said on Twitter.

India's air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, while disaster response teams were airlifted in to help with relief and rescue. Army soldiers have been deployed and helicopters were doing reconnaissance. Navy divers have also been flown in.

Goni, the Philippines' 18th storm this year, is also the strongest typhoon since Haiyan killed more than 6,300 people in the Philippines in 2013.
Goni has left at least 20 people dead as it crossed the Philippines, including six on Catanduanes and 14 in nearby Albay province on Luzon, the authorities said.
Meanwhile, the Singapore Red Cross said it would contribute $50,000 to the Philippine Red Cross to support its disaster relief efforts for typhoon Goni.
This comes on the back of the Singapore Red Cross' contribution of US$75,000 in total to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam on Oct 20.","typhoon, province, vietnam, battering, red, catanduanes, albay, central, united, philippines, heads, goni, cross",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

There are many viable career options out there. For example, under theme park technology, theme park engineers need a solid foundation in structural and electrical engineering, as well as mathematics and geometry.

On the support side, the industry also requires people to work in the design, installation and operation of entertainment devices, systems and venues.

More than 100 world leaders have confirmed they will attend next month's COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in person.
One key aim for the conference is moving finance out of polluting fossil fuels - especially coal - which are responsible for the lion's share of planet-heating emissions.
Cutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of carbon emissions produced worldwide, which they release if they rot or are burned.
