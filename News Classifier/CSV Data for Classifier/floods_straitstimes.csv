But Bild newspaper condemned the ""failure"" to take early action in the battered states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North-Rhine Westphalia.
Gerd Landsberg, head of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, called for an overhaul of the early warning system.
Minister for Research Anja Karliczek said Germany must prepare better for natural disasters, expected to become more frequent because of climate change.","questions, states, system, civil, warning, sirens, germany, weather, rhinelandpalatinate, protection, flood, told, deadly",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

The catastrophic floods that hit north-west Europe this month have heightened concerns that even in some of the world's richest countries, infrastructure is ill prepared to cope with climate change as once-rare weather events become more common.
Developers seeking cash from some EU funds are required to ensure projects like roads, railways and power plants in the 27-member bloc can cope with extreme weather events.
The assessment should also calculate the project's expected greenhouse gas emissions to see if it is compatible with EU climate goals, including the bloc's target to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
The EU's aim is to ensure bridges, railways and power stations built today can withstand the impact of a hotter planet - and avoid locking in decades of emissions that would thwart climate change goals.","commission, proof, cope, weather, checklist, risks, infrastructure, change, eu, creates, projects, eus, emissions, climate, european",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

With Singapore experiencing more floods recently, I wonder if there are sufficient measures to prevent tall machinery such as pile drivers or cranes from floating in flood waters, and consequently toppling?

Are operators required to retract the booms and have them in their horizontal resting positions at the end of each workday and during heavy rain? These heavy machinery can pose serious danger to human lives and damage surrounding structures if they topple.

QUAD SHOULD INVITE CHINA TO JOIN IT

The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad), a strategic dialogue between the United States, Japan, Australia and India, is now concerned with boosting the production capacity of vaccines, supply chains and climate change (Conflict with China not inevitable: US officials, Aug 25).

China is one of the largest vaccine donors and is at the top of the global supply chain. The importance of China's cooperation in fighting climate change is widely acknowledged. It therefore makes sense for the Quad to invite China to join it.

In this phase, the IOD brings more rain than usual to countries in the eastern end of the Indian Ocean basin, including Singapore.
The weather phenomenon is associated with changes in atmospheric pressure and sea surface temperature across the Indian Ocean.
In the negative phase, the winds blowing towards the eastern end of the Indian Ocean intensify.

411,Nov-20,"Singapore experienced flash floods at three locations on Monday (Nov 2). One car was seen submerged. ST answers questions on what to do if your car is near a flash flood.

Q. How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?

It depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, said The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.

Generally, it is not safe to drive through a flood. A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120 to 140mm, which is not very high.

But if necessary, one should gauge the water depth by looking at the road curbs. If the curbs are still visible or just below water level, it is relatively safe to proceed.

If the curb is not visible, it is riskier to proceed unless you are in a tall vehicle like an SUV or a truck. Otherwise, you may end up driving into a drain, canal or over a ledge.

Q. What should I do when driving on a submerged road?

Drive very slowly and steadily in a low gear to keep your engine speed high and constant until your car is out of the water, suggests the Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS).

This prevents water from entering the exhaust pipe, which will damage electronics. Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

To avoid stopping in the middle of the flood, allow oncoming traffic as well as vehicles going in the same direction to pass.

Do not lift your foot or apply brakes midway to minimise turbulence and backflow that can lead to water intake.

After clearing the flooded area, apply the brakes gently for a few minutes to rid them of moisture, which may have impacted their performance.

Q. What should I do if my car stalls while driving through a flash flood?

Do not attempt to restart it as that may damage the engine, said the AAS.

Ensure the car's bonnet is closed because you may have difficulty restarting the engine.

Switch on the hazard lights to alert other drivers around you and call for help",askST: What do I do if my car is caught in a flash flood?,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ask-st-what-do-i-do-if-my-car-is-caught-in-a-flash-flood,"ST answers questions on what to do if your car is near a flash flood.

415,Jan-21,"The prices of vegetables and fish are going up across the board at wet markets in Singapore, with some vegetables costing about twice as much as they were just weeks ago.

The Straits Times visited five wet markets yesterday and vendors said poor weather conditions in Malaysia have caused a shortage of supplies as farms are flooded, resulting in poor crop output.

Transport is also an issue because roads are closed due to the severe flooding.

Mr Alex Zhou, 35, who runs a vegetable stall at the wet market in Pasir Ris Drive 6, said: ""The constant rain in Malaysia has made it hard to transport goods, and we've lost a lot of supply due to the poor weather. Green leafy vegetables like spinach are more affected because they spoil easily in water.""

A vegetable stallholder at Geylang Serai Market, who wanted to be known only as Madam Rashidah, 45, and who runs the business with her husband, said: ""I had to get vegetables from Thailand and Vietnam, which are flown in. This method is more expensive, causing my prices to go up as well.""

Severe flooding in Malaysia over the past few weeks has resulted in tens of thousands of people being evacuated from their homes. Over 48,000 in six states were sheltering in 400 relief centres last Friday.

At the Pasir Ris and Ghim Moh markets, prices of tomatoes have almost doubled, from about $1 to $2 per kilogram to about $3 per kilogram.

A market vendor at Tekka Market said his cost price for tomatoes has more than doubled from $12 per 10kg to $28, while a vendor in Pasir Ris said his supplies now cost $32 per 10kg, up from about $10.

About 178,000 homes have been submerged by floodwaters, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with rescuers mounting a desperate bid to get food and drinking water to those cut off.

Roads, infrastructure and crops in the central region have also been devastated, the charity added, warning that hundreds of thousands would need housing and income support in the coming weeks.

Ms Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu of the Vietnam Red Cross Society said the floods are ""some of the worst we have seen in decades"".

At least 111 people have been killed, the disaster management authority said, while nearly 200,000 have been evacuated.

Among those dead are 22 soldiers who were engulfed in a landslide on Sunday in Quang Tri province, and 13 rescuers who had tried to save workers from a hydropower plant.

A search team is still trying to find 15 of the missing plant workers, who were also caught in a landslide.

Although floodwaters have begun to recede in some areas, images on state media showed villages across the region that were still submerged and a hospital badly flooded in Quang Binh, with water pooling around its beds.

Meanwhile, more rain is forecast to hit the area over the weekend as Storm Saudel blows in from the South China Sea.

434,Nov-20,"TEGUCIGALPA • The remnants of Hurricane Eta have unleashed torrential rain and catastrophic flooding on Central America, with fatalities sharply up mostly because of mudslides as streets turned into rivers and bridges came tumbling down.

More than 70 people were reported killed across the region of mostly poor countries wedged between Mexico and Colombia, and at least hundreds were stranded on rooftops or cut off by floods.

In Guatemala, the death toll shot up past 50 over the course of Thursday, according to President Alejandro Giammattei, who said mudslides around a couple of small towns swallowed about two dozen homes.

""Right now, we're trying to get there on foot because there's no other way,"" said Mr Giammattei, referring to flooded out roads that complicated rescue efforts.

One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday, with winds of 241 kmh before weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland and into neighbouring Honduras.

Families waded through flooded streets of the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, while cars sat almost submerged in parts of the central Guatemalan city of San Pedro Carcha, TV footage and images on social media showed.

Overall, eight fatalities were confirmed in Honduras, as more than 5,000 people were holed up in shelters, while 63 communities were cut off from communications, according to the government. Officials said 20 bridges there had been destroyed.

A video posted on social media showed one of the bridges, spanning the Ulua River just east of San Pedro Sula, disappearing into the waterway after a raging torrent pulled it down.

The government said about 500 people were rescued from their roofs in Honduras on Thursday as water levels continued to rise, but many others were likely still stranded.

""We will not leave the area until we rescue the last person,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told the media, adding that rescue efforts led by police, soldiers and firefighters will continue overnight.

Damage and destruction had spread across most of Honduras and speedboats and helicopters would be sent to take people to safety in inaccessible areas, he said earlier in the day.

Media in Nicaragua also reported two miners had been killed in a mudslide.

Mr Giammattei had already declared a state of emergency in nearly half of Guatemala's 22 departments.

In southern Costa Rica, a landslide killed two people in a house, officials said.

Meanwhile, five people, including three children, died in flooding in Panama's Chiriqui province, near the Costa Rica border, the authorities said.

There was at least one silver lining in Honduras, where 60 fishermen who disappeared at sea on Tuesday returned after taking shelter on cays until they were rescued, said community leader Robin Morales.

Calling their survival a ""miracle,"" Mr Morales said a man among them presumed dead from a heart attack also made it back.

""Our friends are alive, thank God,"" he said.

435,Nov-20,"Q How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?

A This depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, says The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.

Generally, it is not safe to drive through a flood. A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120mm to 140mm, which is not very high.

But, if necessary, one should gauge the water depth by looking at the road kerbs.

If the kerbs are still visible or just below water level, it is relatively safe to proceed.

If the kerbs are not visible, it is riskier to proceed unless you are in a tall vehicle like a sport utility vehicle or a lorry. Otherwise, you may end up driving into a drain, canal or over a ledge.

Q What should I do when driving on a submerged road?

A Drive very slowly and steadily in a low gear to keep your engine speed high and constant until your car is out of the water, suggests the Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS).

This prevents water from entering the exhaust pipe, which would damage the electronics.

Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

Where possible, flooded roads are best negotiated one vehicle at a time. Allow all oncoming traffic and vehicles going in the same direction to pass so as to avoid having to stop in the middle of the flood. Do not lift your foot or apply brakes midway to minimise turbulence and back flow that can lead to water intake.

After clearing the flooded area, apply the brakes gently for a few minutes to rid them of moisture, which could impact their performance.

Q What should I do if my car stalls while driving through a flash flood?

A Do not attempt to restart it as that may damage the engine, says the AAS.

Ensure that the car's bonnet is closed because you may have difficulty restarting the engine.

Switch on the hazard lights to alert other drivers around you and call for help",What do I do if my car is caught in a flash flood?,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-do-i-do-if-my-car-is-caught-in-a-flash-flood,"Q How do I know whether I can drive through a flash flood?
A This depends largely on the amount of ground clearance that one's car has, says The Straits Times' senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.
A typical family car has a ground clearance of 120mm to 140mm, which is not very high.
Driving slowly also reduces the risk of losing steering control.

487,Jul-20,"KURUME (Japan) • Torrential rain pounded the centre of Japan yesterday as the authorities said 55 people were feared dead in days of heavy downpours that have triggered devastating landslides and terrifying floods.

Rains that began early Saturday on the island of Kyushu have already caused widespread damage across a swathe of the southwestern portion of the country, causing rivers to burst their banks and hillsides to collapse.

The weather front was moving north. Yesterday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued warnings in Gifu and Nagano prefectures in central Japan, though it downgraded the advisories from its top level by midday. ""In these areas, heavy rains are at an unprecedented level,"" a JMA official said at an early morning briefing.

""Especially in areas designated as high risk for landslides and flooding, the possibility is extremely high that some kind of disaster is already happening,"" he warned.

At least 80,000 rescue workers have been deployed in a desperate effort to reach survivors stranded by floods and landslides.

Late on Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to double the number of troops involved in the rescue effort to 20,000.

The toll in the disaster has risen steadily as rescue workers find new casualties.

Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said 52 deaths had been confirmed with three more people feared dead.

The toll is expected to rise, with more than a dozen people reported missing and the authorities investigating whether six additional deaths are linked to the disaster.

697,May-20,"KOLKATA/DHAKA • India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, peering down from his aircraft yesterday, saw the devastation and flooding caused by the most powerful cyclone to strike the country and its neighbour Bangladesh in more than a decade, before he landed in the stricken city of Kolkata.

Cyclone Amphan killed at least 96 people in the two countries after it swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. Most of those who died were in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.

The toll is expected to rise as communications are restored and the authorities reach villages cut off by blocked roads.

But the evacuation of about three million people before the cyclone struck undoubtedly reduced the number of casualties.

Mr Modi said the country stood with the people of West Bengal and announced emergency aid of 10 billion rupees (S$188 million) to help the state at a time when it and the rest of India are dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

""Dealing with the pandemic requires social distancing whereas battling the cyclone requires people to move to safer areas,"" Mr Modi said at a school during a stop on a tour to inspect the damage.

""Despite this, West Bengal is fighting well. We are all with West Bengal in these adverse times.""

Mr Modi wore a mask as he stepped onto the tarmac at the airport in Kolkata earlier and was greeted by the state's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other officials, all wearing masks.

Police are using drones to assess the damage in Kolkata, a city of 14 million people, where an estimated 10,000 trees were brought down during the storm that lasted several hours and led to extensive flooding.

Cyclone leaves trail of destruction

MAPUTO/HARARE • Mozambique started three days of national mourning yesterday after a powerful cyclone and flooding killed hundreds of people and left a trail of destruction across swathes of southeast Africa.

Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique's port city of Beira with winds of up to 170kmh last Thursday, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions of people in danger.

Drone footage showed residents of a shantytown at the port still picking through wreckage days after the storm hit and trying to drag plastic sheeting over their ruined homes.

The film, released by the Red Cross, showed the settlement pockmarked with empty plots where the winds had blown whole buildings from their foundations.

""Great floods have sowed mourning and devastation in various areas of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi,"" Pope Francis said yesterday. ""I express my pain and closeness to those dear people.""

Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi said a day earlier that the cyclone had killed more than 200 people in his country but rescuers were still discovering more bodies.

In neighbouring Zimbabwe, the official death count stands at 98 but is likely to grow as hundreds are still missing.

920,Mar-19,"CAIRNS (Queensland) • A ""very destructive"" category 4 cyclone slammed into Australia's remote northern coast yesterday, while a second, equally powerful storm bore down on the country's west.

Cyclone Trevor, pushing a big storm tide and packing winds of up to 250kmh, made landfall on the sparsely populated Northern Territory coast near the Gulf of Carpentaria town of Port McArthur, the Bureau of Meteorology reported.

The storm was downgraded to a category 3 shortly after making landfall, and was expected to weaken further as it travelled inland, though officials warned of heavy rains and flooding.

""There's a concern that flash flooding may occur,"" said emergency operations official Michael Hebb.

The army and police had already evacuated most residents from outposts in Trevor's path, many of them indigenous communities, though a handful of locals remained behind, police said.

There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries from the storm, but evacuated residents feared what they might find when they return home.

""We are only new to the area and the house we are in isn't going to sustain the expected winds that are predicted,"" said Port McArthur resident Emily Crawford, who was evacuated to the regional capital, Darwin. ""This is the scariest thing I've ever been through, I've never lived through even a flooding event, let alone a cyclone of this nature, I hope all my friends and neighbours are safe,"" she told AFP.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said Trevor was driving a ""very dangerous storm tide"" along the coastal regions and that heavy rainfall was expected to cause flooding across wide areas of the Northern Territory and neighbouring Queensland.

At a time when environmentalists are often pitted against agribusinesses in California's water wars, conservation scientists and rice farmers are working together, trying to reclaim the great flood plains of the Sacramento River for salmon habitat.
Now, for the cost and inconvenience of flooding their fields, rice farmers are earning goodwill and betting that a healthy salmon population will avoid new regulations to protect wildlife and keep adequate water flowing.
Before industrialisation, the northern end of California's Central Valley was a miles-wide flood plain straddling the Sacramento River - a natural feeding ground for fish.

As rising temperatures cause the leading edge - the tongue - of a glacier to melt, the retreating ice leaves behind deposits of rock debris.
Melt water from the glacier can then accumulate in the depression behind the dam, eventually forming a new lake.
If the tongue of the glacier extends into this lake, the ice flows twice as fast on average and it therefore melts faster too, according to the study financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.
If glaciers flow more rapidly, the water reserves stored in the ice will also be exhausted more rapidly and rivers will receive less water, the study explained.","water, accelerate, melt, tongue, study, permanent, glaciers, lake, quickly, ice, disappearance, glacier, lakes",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

1175,Nov-20,"In a matter of hours, swathes of the main Philippine island of Luzon were flooded by record downpours from Typhoon Vamco. Rivers burst their banks, landslides smashed into villages and rice fields were flattened. Much of the capital Manila was inundated by muddy water that quickly reached the rooftops of homes in some areas.

It is now just over a week since Vamco struck with unexpected ferocity, leaving many the painful task of cleaning up, rebuilding and mourning lost loved ones. The recovery for many has only just started.

The storm killed 73 people and affected nearly four million others, according to the latest update from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) published yesterday.

Vamco is the 21st storm to hit the Philippines this year and quickly followed Typhoon Goni, which was ranked as among the strongest typhoons to hit the country in years, with winds exceeding 300kmh. Goni left at least 26 dead and displaced close to a million.

The Philippines is used to typhoons. But this year, the season has been especially active, with Vietnam also being hit by a series of devastating storms.

The typhoon season usually starts in June and peters out by November. In recent years, however, the strongest typhoons have been slamming the country in November and December.

Vamco, which quickly gathered strength as it approached Luzon, dumped record levels of rain that paralysed nearly all of Metropolitan Manila two Thursdays ago. Dramatic rescues played out across several cities, with tens of thousands rescued by rubber dinghies, small motorised boats, canoes and even jet skis, Reuters reported at the time.

In Marikina City and nearby Rizal province, home to nearly three million, residents fled to the upper floors of their homes or climbed onto rooftops as flood waters rose rapidly after a 78km river breached its banks.

In Cagayan province, at the northern tip of Luzon, Vamco turned the once picturesque Cagayan River into a sea of murky brown, killing dozens and setting off deadly landslides.

1193,Feb-21,"NEW DELHI • Around 125 people are missing in northern India after a Himalayan glacier broke and swept away a small hydroelectric dam yesterday, with floods forcing the evacuation of villages downstream.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down the Dhauli Ganga river valley located in the state of Uttarakhand, more than 500km north of New Delhi.

""It came very fast; there was no time to alert anyone,"" Mr Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of the river in Raini village, said by phone. ""I felt that even we would be swept away.""

Earlier, the state's Chief Secretary Om Prakash said 100 to 150 people were feared dead. A large number of the missing were workers at the 13.2MW Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project, which was destroyed by the glacier.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters at a press conference in Dehradun, the state capital, that the number of missing could rise. The bodies of 10 people have been recovered so far.

Twelve people trapped in a tunnel have been rescued and efforts were under way to save others caught in another tunnel, the federal Home Ministry said after a meeting of the National Crisis Committee, comprising top officials.

With the main road washed away, the tunnel was filled with mud and rocks and paramilitary rescuers had to climb down a hillside using ropes to get access to the entrance.

Scores of social media users captured the disaster, with footage showing the massive burst of water tearing through a narrow valley below the power plant, leaving roads and bridges destroyed in its wake. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was monitoring the relief operation. ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there,"" Mr Modi said on Twitter.

India's air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, while disaster response teams were airlifted in to help with relief and rescue. Army soldiers have been deployed and helicopters were doing reconnaissance. Navy divers have also been flown in.

Goni has left at least 20 people dead as it crossed the Philippines, including six on Catanduanes and 14 in nearby Albay province on Luzon, the authorities said.
Meanwhile, the Singapore Red Cross said it would contribute $50,000 to the Philippine Red Cross to support its disaster relief efforts for typhoon Goni.

Although most of the evacuees were later allowed to return home on Friday, the blaze more than tripled in size to spread over about 3,642ha, scorching mostly former sugarcane fields and brush.

""I am declaring our Valley Isle a disaster area for the purpose of implementing the emergency management functions as allowed by law,"" Governor David Ige said in a statement on Friday.

The fire in Maui, sometimes called the Valley Isle, had been 60 per cent contained by sunset but officials warned that even though the shelters were shut, they might need to reopen if more evacuations were ordered.

The authorities had also managed to contain about 35 per cent of a second, smaller fire across roughly 81ha, that had broken out north of the first near Kahului, forcing some voluntary evacuations.

This second fire was being investigated as a possible arson by the Maui Police Department, local media reported. No other details were available early yesterday.

The major blaze began in the island's central valley last Thursday, with its flames stoked by steady winds of up to 30kmh, officials said.

Thousands of residents and visitors in the communities of Maalaea and Kihei fled as a precaution, while firefighters struggling to quell the blaze used helicopters to drop water on the flames.

Waves of panic buying have swept supermarket shelves clean and there are concerns the virus will sicken farmers and food factory workers, while shipments will be stalled by border controls.

In Malaysia, fishermen and vegetable farmers have had to dump their produce because they have not been able to get it to their customers, citing road blocks and a lack of manpower. Fortunately, some suppliers have linked up directly with online delivery services to get the produce to buyers.

So far, global food supplies and delivery are functioning. But concerns remain and the longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the fears of disruption.

The world's food system is already highly leveraged because of globalisation, with many nations reliant on imports and efficient transport and storage. The system is vulnerable to sudden shocks, which has led to unrest in the recent past.

In 2010, a combination of droughts and severe floods in key grain growing countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Russia, caused food shortages and price spikes that fuelled political unrest in the Middle East, triggering the Arab Spring.

""Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not average changes,"" noted Dr Sarah Perkins-Kilpatrick, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales' Climate Change Research Centre.","insurers, global, hurricanes, report, 200b, deg, weather, cost, warming, change, disasters, climate, world, c, deadly",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

The storm failed to deliver the punch in Florida that state officials had feared.
It was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday evening when its sustained winds slipped below 119kmh; they were about 104kmh most of Sunday but picked up again to 112kmh late in the afternoon.

""This disaster is a catastrophe,"" Prime Minister Carlos Antonio do Rosario told reporters in Beira.

The government says there are still around 15,000 people needing to be saved.

More than 65,000 people are already in shelters in central Mozambique and other sites are being opened.

In Dondo, near Beira, food distribution finally started on Thursday at one of 20 schools transformed into emergency shelters.

""Today is the first day we receive help,"" said survivor Marta Antonio. ""But they don't give it to everyone, they only give it to those who are in the rooms. But those outside receive nothing,"" she said.

Victims who were not housed in the centres were frustrated. They complained that they had been forgotten and for those lining up for something to eat, the food was insufficient.

""I have four children, and they're only going to eat bread? Give me a bag of aid,"" demanded one man, who did not give his name.

Meantime, the main morgue in Beira is teeming with bodies and burials are impossible because the city cemeteries are flooded, said the ICRC.

""The mortuary at the city's main hospital is full and there are dozens of bodies that need to be removed and cared for in a dignified way,"" said ICRC in a statement. ""The humanitarian needs will tragically only deepen in the coming weeks,"" it added.

By employing algorithms to filter content according to users' specific likes and dislikes, social media platforms add to the risk of skewing users' news diet and amplifying their confirmation biases.

As children are especially vulnerable, it is crucial that they master effective reading skills to make informed decisions in a world that is increasingly swamped with falsehoods.

To develop this sophisticated skill, parents should navigate digital content with their children to help them interpret information and boost their critical reading skills from a young age.

Ms Leslie Davis, a reading specialist and training consultant at the British Council, shared tips with The Straits Times' senior education correspondent, Ms Sandra Davie, on how parents can train their children to be discerning content consumers and responsible generators in the digital age.

How can parents help develop effective reading skills in children?

Ms Davis noted that students in Singapore tend to offer monosyllabic answers such as ""I don't know"" when asked for an opinion. By asking the right questions, parents can encourage deeper thinking and empower their children to support their views with confidence.

For a start, parents can raise conversations regarding issues that their children care about. From there, even simple questions like ""Do you agree with the author? Why?"" can spark off meaningful discussions.

The death toll in Mozambique has risen to 217 and around 15,000 people, many of them very ill, still need to be rescued, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said, although rescue workers continue to find bodies and the toll could rise sharply.

Mr Connor Hartnady, leader of a South African rescue operations task force, said a key priority yesterday was to push into remaining areas affected by the flooding that had not yet been explored in search of people needing rescue.

Helicopters were ferrying people, some plucked from the roofs of buildings and treetops, to the port city of Beira, the main headquarters for the huge rescue operation.

One helicopter returned with four children and two women rescued from a small football stadium in an otherwise submerged village.

One young child, with a broken leg, was alone, and hung limp from exhaustion as rescuers laid him on the grass before moving him on to an ambulance.

An elderly woman sat, dazed, nearby with two of her grandchildren. All three were unharmed, but the children had lost their mother.

With floodwaters starting to recede, the priority now is to deliver food and other supplies to people on the ground rather than take people out of the affected areas, although that is also still happening, Mr Correia said.

Some 3,000 people have so far been rescued, he added.

""Our biggest fight is against the clock,"" he told a news conference, adding that the authorities were using all means possible to save lives and were working 24 hours a day.

Cyclone Idai lashed Beira in Mozambique with winds of up to 170kmh a week ago, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions at risk.

Thousands of Afghans have also applied for new travel documents to escape a growing economic and humanitarian crisis described by the United Nations as an ""avalanche of hunger"".
The authorities will start issuing the travel documents from Sunday at Kabul's passport office, Mr Alam Gul Haqqani, the head of the passport department in the Interior Ministry, told reporters.
The Taliban stopped issuing passports shortly after their Aug 15 return to power, as tens of thousands of people scrambled to Kabul's only airport in a bid to catch any international flight that could evacuate them.
Issuing passports is seen as a test of the Taliban's commitment to the international community to allow eligible people to leave amid the growing humanitarian crisis.","taliban, resumes, authorities, afghan, passports, travel, united, passport, documents, kabul, issuing, office",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

Researchers found that the benefits of effective peat land restoration outweigh the cost of restoration.
Scientists have long known that protecting and restoring Indonesia's carbon-rich peat lands is a vital solution to curbing climate change.
Indonesia's peat lands store an estimated 57 billion tonnes of carbon.
When drained, the peat lands dry out and become vulnerable to fire that can burn for weeks to months.","restoration, indonesias, restoring, study, lands, 2015, fragile, sake, indonesia, peat, benefits, reveals, land, efforts, peats",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last month announced Japan would aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a major shift for the world's third-largest economy which relies heavily on imported fossil fuels for its energy sources.
The emergency, non-binding declaration - drafted by a cross-party group of legislators - cites ""unprecedented damage"" from hurricanes, flooding and forest fires, exacerbated by climate change at home and abroad, and said the world faces a ""climate crisis"".
The government is developing measures including investment funds and tax incentives to push through changes needed to reach the net zero emissions target, and Mr Furukawa said the declaration would give impetus to those efforts, given its non-partisan backing.
Announcing the new emissions target, Prime Minister Suga said Japan would ""pursue nuclear power"", along with introducing as much renewable energy as possible, without specifying precise plans for reactors.","target, worlds, world, group, goal, declare, climate, zero, lawmakers, sets, emissions, vote, declaration, emergency, japan",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

La Nina is considered the stormy sister of El Nino, which occurs every two to seven years, when the prevailing trade winds that circulate surface water in the tropical Pacific start to weaken.
The UN agency pointed to fresh data indicating that sea surface temperatures for the coming three months were expected to be above average for most of the globe - something that in turn would influence land surface temperatures.","wmo, la, nino, remain, high, weather, nina, expected, temperatures, influence, set, climate, surface, likely",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

The dead zone, an area of the northern Gulf of Mexico with low oxygen levels that appears every summer, is produced by nutrients washing into the Mississippi, many from fertiliser used on farmland in the river's vast watershed.
The result is an area with low oxygen levels that kills some sea creatures and drives others to move elsewhere.
And while the Gulf dead zone is famous, he added, ""it's not unique to the Gulf"".

Countries already battered by climate disasters such as record-breaking drought, flooding and storms are demanding they be compensated separately for ""loss and damage"", and have made it a red line.
Mr Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate policy think tank E3G, said loss and damage talks were a ""cliffhanger moment"" for the entire summit.
Developing nations say it is unfair for the summit to produce an unbalanced agreement on mitigation - how economies can ditch fossil fuels by 2050.

Countries are in Glasgow to work out how to implement the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
""All countries are playing hardball,"" Stephen Leonard, climate law and policy specialist and veteran COP observer said.
""We have a lot of work to do across all issues that remain,"" said Britain's chief negotiator Archie Young.

But with only one more week to go, major points of contention remain and ministers from many nations have arrived in Glasgow to try to give things a push.
The issues are close to tipping point for many indebted poorer nations.
The goal is likely to be reached by 2022 or 2023, the United Nations said.

1744,Jan-20,"NAIROBI • Billions of locusts swarming through East Africa are the result of extreme weather swings and could prove catastrophic for a region still reeling from drought and deadly floods, experts said.

Dense clouds of the ravenous insects have spread from Ethiopia and Somalia into Kenya, in the region's worse infestation in decades.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated the size of one swarm in Kenya at 2,400 sq km, meaning it could contain up to 200 billion locusts, each of which is able to consume its own weight in food every day.

The locust invasion is the biggest in Ethiopia and Somalia in 25 years, and the biggest in Kenya in 70 years, according to the FAO.

If unchecked, locust numbers could grow 500 times by June, spreading to Uganda and South Sudan, and devastating crops and pasture in a region which is already one of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world.

This could lead to ""a major food security problem"", Dr Guleid Artan of regional expert group, the Climate Prediction and Applications Centre, told a press conference in Nairobi.

The South-North Water Diversion Project was first proposed in 1952 to ease flooding in the south and drought in the north, but critics say its costs are too high and the diversion of polluted water to other regions could contaminate other lakes and rivers.
Preliminary work is now under way on the second phase, which will raise annual delivery capacity from 8.77 billion cubic m to 16.5 billion cubic m, said Shi Chunxian, head of the planning office of the Ministry of Water Resources.
The project has so far delivered a total of almost 30 billion cubic m of water to the north in five years, supplying 120 million people, vice-water minister Zhang Youguang told the briefing.
Many Chinese cities have come to rely increasingly on elaborate water diversion schemes, with China still prioritising grand engineering feats over tackling pollution or improving conservation and efficiency.","water, double, way, transfers, north, south, m, billion, regions, cubic, phase, china, diversion, ii, project",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

So I turn up at Como Cuisine for breakfast one weekday morning and find the place packed to the rafters with the ladies who lunch.

These women, perfectly dressed and coiffed, have breakfast in flocks too.

I had heard the restaurant serves a good thosai for breakfast. It is new on the menu, which was recently retooled to showcase signature offerings from Como's resorts and hotels around the world.

It takes a lot to tear me away from the delicious versions served at MTR and Saravana Bhavan in Little India, but I love thosai and have to try this one.

Choking back massive sticker shock, I order Masala Dosa ($22). It comes from Como's property in Cocoa Island in the Maldives.

It is smashing. The crepe is beautifully thin and crisp, lacy at the edges. The spiced potato filling has lots of oomph, as does the toor dhal curry, with okra and strips of kale. But really, I could give them both up and just have the crepe with lashings of coconut chutney. That chutney, thick, creamy and unabashedly rich, haunts my dreams. One of the wait staff offers more and I greedily say yes, happy to abandon lentils and potatoes.

I decide I could eat this for breakfast every day. And I will. The minute I become a lady who lunches.

Extra June-September monsoon rainfall will help farmers expand areas under winter-sown crops such as wheat, rice rapeseed and chick peas, improving their earning potential and helping revive tepid rural demand that has stung Indian economic growth.
The longer monsoon could also restock reservoirs and help replenish ground water, helping assuage water shortages in pockets of the country of 1.3 billion people.
But heavy rainfall in some areas has damaged summer-sown crops like cotton, soybean and pulses that are close to harvest.
The monsoon delivers about 70 per cent of India's annual rainfall and determines the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds, such as soybeans.","water, sept, longer, crops, highest, weather, wheat, winter, cent, monsoon, rice, trillion, 25, rainfall, indian, boost",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

1929,May-19,"According to a 2007 forestry ministry regulation, the area has been declared a grand forest park, which functions as a conservation area.

Mr Dwi Sawung of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) was among the first experts to raise concern over the potential environmental ramifications if either of the two areas were turned into a new major city.

""Most land in Kalimantan is peatland. They might need to do preliminary work, like digging and solidifying the peatland, before starting to construct infrastructure for the new capital,"" Mr Dwi said.

Such changes to the peatland, he added, could threaten existing carbon reserves and worsen global warming, despite the government's attempts to mitigate climate change.

Massive land clearing around the site of the new capital could exacerbate the situation.

Bukit Soeharto has been declared a taman hutan rakyat (grand national park) or tahura, according to a 2007 forestry ministerial regulation, as the area was meant to be preserved as conservation area. However, the area has been scarred by illegal logging and the opening of plantations by residents for years.

""Despite current conditions, further land clearing would worsen the (environmental impact). It might lead to flooding similar to (that often seen in) Jakarta.""

World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia senior manager for forest and climate Arief Wijaya echoed Mr Dwi's statement, saying an impact on the environment was an inevitable consequence of the planned relocation.

""Therefore, the government should conduct a comprehensive study on the project's impact on the environment of the new capital, as well as its economic benefits,"" Mr Arief said.

Presidential spokesperson Johan Budi said the government would soon form a joint team of officials from ministries and state institutions, which would be tasked with spearheading the further assessment of each location considered for the new capital.

""The assessment will be extensive, not only in terms of demography or geography, but it will also cover an environmental assessment, such as to find out whether or not (cutting down forest areas) would cause floods,"" Mr Johan told The Jakarta Post.

The team would be responsible for advising the President on which location was most suitable for setting up a new political and administrative hub, including deciding on infrastructure development and the funding scheme, he said.

The president's trip to East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan would not be the last in the quest to survey possible cities for the new capital, and the president was also set to visit other locations soon, Mr Johan added, without elaborating.

The government, however, would need to sit down with lawmakers to discuss the details of the plan, including the new location of the capital city as well as the budget needed for the move, before it could be finalised.

DOCKING TERMINALS DAMAGED

Energy Minister Joram Gumbo said the pipeline bringing fuel from Beira had not been affected by the cyclone but the docking terminals at Beira port had been damaged.

He said Zimbabwe had 62 days supply of petrol and 32 days for diesel, which is in short supply and has led to long queues in the capital. In Mutare city, near Mozambique, diesel shortages were worse, according to a Reuters witness.

""It is the docking terminals at Beira port in Mozambique which were damaged not the pipeline itself,"" Mr Gumbo said told state power company officials.

Around 15,000 people needed rescuing in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said, either by being airlifted out or getting aid dropped to them to survive.

UN humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke told a regular UN briefing in Geneva the world body was working with planning figures of 600,000 people affected by the cyclone in Mozambique and 840,000 in Malawi.

On Zimbabwe, he had heard from relief agencies an operational figure of 250,000 affected people.

Briefing his team late on Thursday night, Mr Connor Hartnady, rescue operations task force leader for Rescue South Africa, said Beira residents were becoming fed up with shortages.

""There have been three security incidents today, all food related,"" he told his team, without giving further details.

Hartnady also said a group of 60 people had been discovered trapped by flood water in an area north of Beira during a reconnaissance flight. Rescue teams and the government were deciding how best to help them, he said, either by airlifting them to safety or dropping supplies.

RIVER BANKS BURST

Commenting on Beira, Mr Laerke said if people were desperate to get aid, that should be treated as part of the community response and not as a security matter.

""These are desperate people,"" Mr Laerke said. ""I don't think anybody would blame a desperate mother or father who have children who do not have clean water to drink or food to eat who grab it from wherever they find it in a shop.""

The storm's rains caused the Buzi and Pungwe rivers, whose mouths are in the Beira area, to burst their banks.

Roads into Beira were cut off by the storm, and most of the city remains without power. The Red Cross has estimated 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed in the storm.

The ""Factory Sandbox"" initiative aims to protect three million jobs and support manufacturers who contribute about 700 billion baht (S$28.6 billion) to gross domestic product, according to a government statement this week.
The Sandbox programme will focus on large factories that manufacture cars, electronics, food and medical equipment for exports in provinces that are key production hubs.
The Federation also called for faster inoculations of factory workers, a cohort that has a combined vaccination rate of only 10 per cent.
Earlier in the pandemic, when Thailand was considered a success story for its relatively limited number of virus cases, the government said factory workers would be a priority group for vaccinations.","286, factories, sector, supply, starts, thailands, protect, programme, workers, focus, cent, according, billion, sandbox, factory, thailand, manufacturing",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

California relies on winter storms for most of its water and those systems are usually deflected northward during a La Nina.
The consequences of La Nina go beyond the US.

The move to centralise vaccine procurement will come as a relief to Indian states that are strapped for funds.
At this pace, it will take another 22 months to cover 75 per cent of the population, according to Bloomberg's vaccination tracker.
While the federal government gives free vaccines to those over 45 and frontline workers, state governments and private hospitals have until now been left to inoculate people from 18 to 45 years for a fee.","indias, vaccines, adults, announces, population, modi, vaccination, virus, free, cent, doses, shots, billion, backflips, vaccine, drive, wave",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (flood)

The Parliament voted on Thursday to allow members of the public to challenge EU laws and decisions that could violate laws relating to the environment, whereas the current law allows only non-governmental organisations to do so.
The parliament also said court proceedings must not be prohibitively expensive, as that could restrict the public's access to justice.

The World Economic Forum ranked Singapore 54 out of 153 countries on gender equality.

But activists here say that though indicators of equality show that women are doing well, traditional definitions of gender roles perpetuated by patriarchal values still hold women back. Many still play an outsized role at home, and hit glass ceilings at work, or even suffer from sexual violence.

These are the issues that the Government hopes to address in an ongoing review of issues affecting Singapore women.

Announcing the Conversations on Women Development last September, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam spoke about the need to change fundamentally how society views gender equality.

""It must lead us to think, not in terms of accepting differentials, and then seeing what can be done to correct that. We must instead start with accepting equality, and any differential treatment then has to be justified,"" he had said.

Since then, 37 dialogues have been held involving more than 1,800 participants that included working mothers, young women, housewives, and even men, says the Ministry of Social and Family Development.
