The authorities in both cities are asking citizens to reduce water consumption, with rainfall between January to October this year down by a quarter, compared with average levels over the last decade, according to the Guangzhou government.
The inflow of water into the East River Basin, a major supply of water for both cities, will remain at around 50 per cent to 60 per cent of its usual level into next spring, according to an official notice on Monday (Dec 6).
The company in charge of Guangzhou's water supply is taking emergency measures to deal with increased salt tides, where the water supply becomes increasingly saline due to a lack of fresh water, it said on Wednesday.

The latest report on the state of Africa's climate by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and African Union agencies paints a dire picture of the continent's ability to adapt to increasingly frequent weather disasters.
Africa, which accounts for less than 4 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, has long been expected to be severely impacted by climate change.
The report estimated that sub-Saharan Africa would need to spend US$30 - US$50 billion, or 2 - 3 per cent of GDP, each year on adaptation to avert even worse consequences.

Extremely high temperatures also sharply boost demand for water, further straining depleted reservoirs and rivers.
The report focuses on drought in six states comprising the American South-west, home more than 60 million people, but its implications stretch beyond that region, the authors said.
While summer 2021 brought welcome monsoon rains to parts of the South-west, several years of above-average rain and high-elevation snow are needed to replenish the region's reservoirs, streams and soils.

The drought emergency affects 42 per cent of the population, mainly in northern and central California - southern counties including Los Angeles and San Diego are not yet affected, nor is San Francisco.
It gives state water authorities additional powers to control scarce resources, and eases some regulations.
A 15 per cent cut in water use would save to supply more than 1.7 million households for a year.","water, states, save, drought, state, 15, residents, los, cent, californias, cut, emergency, california, angeles, asks, droughthit",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

At least 3,000 homes were destroyed and almost three billion koalas, kangaroos, reptiles and other animals were killed or displaced.
""However, the warming trend, primarily caused by climate change, increases the likelihood of extreme events that are beyond our historical experience,"" said the State of the Climate 2020 report.

Australia's climate has warmed on average by 1.44 deg C since 1910 and this will result in more wild fires, droughts, and marine heat waves, the report said.
""Climate change is influencing these trends through its impact on temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity, and the resulting change to the fuel moisture content,"" BoM scientist Karl Braganza said.
Morrison has refused to match other developed countries in setting a target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but has said that the country, in line with the Paris accord, expects to reach net zero emissions after 2050.
Longer-lasting marine heat waves will raise the likelihood of more frequent bleaching events in coral reefs, including the Great Barrier reef.","wildfire, science, waves, droughts, zero, australia, weather, prolonged, carbon, change, australias, southeast, emissions, seasons, climate, trends, forecasts",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's signing last year of a five-page order for a permanent moratorium on the issuance of new permits for businesses in primary forests and peatlands covering 66 million ha will be toothless without strong enforcement.
But reality in the field in Sumatra and Kalimantan could be 'business as usual' without strong oversight by central and local government authorities.
It is therefore imperative that the central and local administrations strengthen cooperation with large companies managing millions of ha of pulpwood and oil palm estates in Sumatra and Kalimantan to enforce preventive measures against forest fires during the May-October dry season.
However, plantation companies cannot simply erect walls around their concessions by procuring equipment and training their own firefighting personnel and rapid-response teams.","local, close, plantation, kalimantan, ha, forest, deforestation, eye, season, fires, sumatra, post, current, million, jakarta, dry, peatland, alerts",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

139,19-Sep,"SYDNEY • Large numbers of bats are being found severely emaciated or starved to death in Australia amid a prolonged drought that is crippling their food supply, according to wildlife carers and environment officials.

There has been a ""rapid increase"" in the number of stricken native flying foxes found in areas of Queensland and New South Wales over the past two weeks, said rescue group Bats Queensland.

Volunteer wildlife carer Ashley Fraser said yesterday that parts of the picturesque Gold Coast, a popular tourist destination, were ""littered"" with hundreds of dead bats.

She added that although there have been cases of mass bat starvation in the region in the past, her organisation had never dealt with an event on this scale.

""We can expect to see it get worse. The changing climate is going to worsen the drought and make it a pretty poor environment for bats to try to survive in.""

Some flying fox species are listed as vulnerable to extinction. The creatures are also a key pollinator of eucalyptus trees, the koala's main food source.

Queensland's Department of Environment and Science said officials believed the deaths were linked to the impact of the extended drought, as well as of recent bush fires and storms, on the bats' food supply.

Ms Fraser said many of the flying foxes rescued by Bats Queensland were so emaciated that their bodies had begun shutting down beyond the point of repair, forcing carers to euthanise them. Even for those deemed fit enough to survive up to seven weeks of rehabilitation, the future remains uncertain.

""We don't want to be releasing them if there aren't the food sources out there,"" Ms Fraser said.

Several rivers are predicted to run dry by November as summer starts, and the Bureau of Meteorology says there is no sign that the drought is going to end soon.

157,19-Mar,"Taps ran dry for long stretches of the day for Manila Water's more than six million customers.

The National Kidney and Transplant Institute, a government hospital north of Manila, was forced to stop water supply for its hospital rooms, so it could continue running its 70 dialysis machines.

Another government hospital, in Pasig, cut surgical procedures by half, as its water reservoir nearly went empty.

First responders reported that fire hydrants had gone dry.

In recent days, there had been a mad rush to buy pails that could hold at least 30 litres of water. A clerk at one of the nation's largest retailers of household and sundry goods said a restaurant owner cleaned up the store's entire stock of large pails and plastic drums.

Distributors of distilled water had stopped taking calls, and car wash operators had shut down.

Police stations and jails were buying more water containers for inmates held in their cells.

A cleaning staff at SM North Edsa, the country's largest mall, said toilets at two floors were closed.

Not even senior government officials have been spared.

President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Salvador Panelo told reporters he was in the middle of taking a shower when the taps suddenly went dry.

The situation has not been this bad since the government privatised water distribution in Metro Manila in 1997.

Taps are running dry because Manila Water, which supplies half of Metro Manila, has not have enough water sources to cover growing demand.

""This is really a supply deficit issue,"" said the company's president Ferdinand de la Cruz.

Manila Water draws 1.6 billion litres of water a day from Angat dam, in Bulacan province, north of Manila. In recent years, though, it has had to supply 1.75 billion litres a day, as the population in its concession area grows.

To cover for the shortfall, Manila Water has also been drawing water from the much smaller La Mesa dam.

With a recent long dry spell, however, the water level at La Mesa plunged to its lowest in 21 years, and Manila Water could no longer draw sufficient volume from it.

Demand surged after Manila Water announced supply interruptions last week and set off hoarding.

Government regulators are blaming Manila Water for failing to augment its capacity and tap new sources and for relying solely on La Mesa and on water rationing.

The company's officials retorted that this was because the government sat on its requests to build more reservoirs and water treatment plants, as well as proposals to build a new dam, to be funded by China, to augment the capital's water sources.

Congress is stepping in. Separate committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are set to probe the water shortage next week.

Leftist groups said they would lead a class suit against Manila Water.

Manila Water said the situation would return to normal when the rains come.

To that, Manila Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle exhorted the country's 100 million Catholics to pray for rain.

158,19-Mar,"SYDNEY • An unrelenting drought in parts of eastern Australia is expected to weigh on economic growth this year even if average rainfall returns soon, a senior central banker said yesterday.

The worst drought in living memory has already cut total gross domestic product by 0.15 per cent, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) deputy governor Guy Debelle said in a speech in Sydney.

While the impact of climate change is usually most severe on agriculture, global warming presents significant risks and opportunities for a broader part of the A$1.9 trillion (S$1.8 trillion) economy, he said.

In his speech, titled Climate Change And The Economy, Mr Debelle said monetary policy was always focused on analysing and assessing a large number of forces.

""But few of these forces have the scale, persistence and systemic risk of climate change,"" he said.

""What if droughts are more frequent, or cyclones happen more often? The supply shock is no longer temporary but close to permanent,"" he added.

Australia had its third warmest year on record last year, marked by drought and a prolonged bush fire season, with maximum temperatures about 1.55 deg C above average across the country.

Mr Debelle said: ""The challenges we have to address are to take the outcomes from climate modelling and map them into our economic modelling.","Drought hurting GDP, says Aussie central bank",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/drought-hurting-gdp-says-aussie-central-bank,"SYDNEY • An unrelenting drought in parts of eastern Australia is expected to weigh on economic growth this year even if average rainfall returns soon, a senior central banker said yesterday.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned that the country could expect more heatwaves and little rain in the east during the summer, which runs from December through February, following one of the driest springs ever.
The hot, dry spring led to an early start to Australia's bush fire season, with people killed and more than 500 homes destroyed since September.
Temperatures across most of the country are highly likely to be warmer than average during the day and night, the bureau said.
The dry spring and weak outlook for summer rains in the east were due mainly to warmer than average waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa, combined with cooler than normal waters off Indonesia.","summer, tough, drought, east, bureau, weather, prepares, australia, warmer, spring, australias, dry, average, heatwaves, outlook",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

An importer was issued a permit to ship bulk wheat from Canada, the Australian Department of Agriculture & Water Resources said on its website on Tuesday (May 14).
While Australia does import small quantities of speciality wheat grades each year, a bulk shipment like this is significant because it is so rare.
Prolonged drought has gripped eastern Australia, frying wheat and other grain crops.

They examined how the global trade and supplies of wheat, a crop used for food staples like bread and pasta, would be affected by four years of severe drought in the United States, one of the world's top exporters of the grain.
As reserves are depleted, changes in production would have a bigger impact on the price of food, Ms Heslin added.
Reduced global reserves would also mean a smaller buffer against future shocks such as a drought in other wheat-producing nations like Russia or France, she said.
Scientists have warned that hotter temperatures and more erratic rainfall could increase the frequency and intensity of droughts, with multi-year droughts already wreaking havoc in many nations.","global, country, states, disrupt, food, supply, reserves, supplies, research, wheat, shocks, united, climate, world, trade",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)
191,20-Mar,"ROME • Catastrophic crop failures caused by extreme weather in just one country could disrupt global food supplies and drive price spikes in an interconnected world, exposing how climate change threatens global stability, researchers have said.

They examined how the global trade and supplies of wheat, a crop used for food staples like bread and pasta, would be affected by four years of severe drought in the United States, one of the world's top exporters of the grain.

Based on two models of how countries could try to meet their needs, an international research team found the US would deplete nearly all its wheat reserves after four years in both scenarios, while global stocks could drop by 31 per cent.

The 174 countries to which America exports wheat would see their reserves decrease, even though they did not themselves suffer failed harvests, according to a study published in the journal Frontiers In Sustainable Food Systems. ""It affects almost every country in the world because the US has so many trade links,"" lead author Alison Heslin, a researcher at Columbia University's Centre for Climate Systems Research and Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said yesterday.

Those links mean there is a cascading effect, either directly from the US or via one of its trading partners, which could reduce the amount of wheat available and lead to price increases, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. As reserves are depleted, changes in production would have a bigger impact on the price of food, Dr Heslin added.

Reduced global reserves would also mean a smaller buffer against future shocks such as a drought in other wheat",Climate shocks in one country could disrupt global food supplies,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/climate-shocks-in-one-country-could-disrupt-global-food-supplies,"ROME • Catastrophic crop failures caused by extreme weather in just one country could disrupt global food supplies and drive price spikes in an interconnected world, exposing how climate change threatens global stability, researchers have said.

Reduced global reserves would also mean a smaller buffer against future shocks such as a drought in other wheat-producing nations like Russia or France, she said.
Dr Heslin said global food security was key to people's health and safety, with international food price spikes in 2008 and 2011 curtailing families' ability to purchase food and rattling political stability as people protested on the streets.
Maintaining strategic food reserves and a diverse set of trading partners could help countries reduce risks, she added.","global, country, disrupt, food, drought, world, supplies, reserves, wheat, shocks, united, price, climate, heslin, countries",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

Years of record-breaking drought that emptied reservoirs and prompted unprecedented urban water conservation, segued into heavy rain that dumped record inches on northern California in 2016-2017.
In early 2017, the main spillway at Lake Oroville, the state's second largest reservoir, collapsed, causing 200,000 people to be evacuated, and the state only narrowly escaped an even greater disaster.","conundrum, water, states, wetter, state, dries, climate, wildfires, wets, change, rain, california, waterthe, temperatures, californias, unprecedented, drier, urban",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

208,19-May,SYDNEY (REUTERS) ,Australia weather bureau sees reduced El Nino threat,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/australia-weather-bureau-sees-reduced-el-nino-threat,"SYDNEY (REUTERS) - A recent cooling of the Pacific Ocean has reduced the threat of an El Nino weather event developing this year, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said on Tuesday (May 14).
While sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean remain close to El Nino levels, water beneath the surface has slowly cooled over the past few months, BOM said.
As a result, there is now a 50 per cent chance of an El Nino developing, down from previous forecast of 70 per cent, BOM added.
An El Nino weather event can trigger floods and drought in different parts of the world, and is associated with warmer, dry weather across the Asia-Pacific.
The weather outlook comes at a time when dry conditions have wilted crops and pasture in Australia's east coast, leaving many farmers struggling to survive.","reduced, nino, bom, pacific, bureau, event, weather, el, sees, australia, ocean, developing, dry, threat, surface",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

A global index released on Thursday (Feb 3) by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation showed that food prices in January climbed to their highest level since 2011, when skyrocketing costs contributed to political uprisings in Egypt and Libya.
Even before the pandemic, global food prices had been trending upwards as disease wiped out much of China's pig herd and the United States-China trade war resulted in Chinese tariffs on US agricultural goods.
But as the pandemic began in early 2020, the world experienced seismic shifts in demand for food.
While food prices appear set to stabilise, events like a conflict in Ukraine, a major producer of wheat and corn, or further adverse weather could change that calculation, Mr Bogmans said.","global, food, worlds, poorest, high, threatening, 2decade, supply, weather, increases, pandemic, hit, prices, cent, price, world",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

At a time when environmentalists are often pitted against agribusinesses in California's water wars, conservation scientists and rice farmers are working together, trying to reclaim the great flood plains of the Sacramento River for salmon habitat.
Now, for the cost and inconvenience of flooding their fields, rice farmers are earning goodwill and betting that a healthy salmon population will avoid new regulations to protect wildlife and keep adequate water flowing.
Before industrialisation, the northern end of California's Central Valley was a miles-wide flood plain straddling the Sacramento River - a natural feeding ground for fish.

The US$47 billion in the Bill designated for ""climate resilience"" is intended to help communities prepare for the new age of extreme fires, floods, storms and droughts that scientists say are worsened by human-caused climate change.
Its approval by Congress with bipartisan support reflects an implicit acknowledgement of that fact by at least some Republicans, even though many of the party's leaders still question or deny the established science of human-caused climate change.
""It's significant that we could get a significant bipartisan measure that recognised that climate change was real and we need to protect our infrastructure against its impacts,"" said the Democrat.
Still, experts and lawmakers call the level of spending for ""climate resilience"" in the infrastructure Bill historic, particularly after four years in which former president Donald Trump denied the established science of climate change, decimated environmental regulations and withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord.","prepare, resilience, spending, impacts, prevent, major, infrastructure, change, bill, investment, billion, makes, climate",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

Dense clouds of the ravenous insects have spread from Ethiopia and Somalia into Kenya, in the region's worse infestation in decades.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated the size of one swarm in Kenya at 2,400 sq km, meaning it could contain up to 200 billion locusts, each of which is able to consume its own weight in food every day.

The locust invasion is the biggest in Ethiopia and Somalia in 25 years, and the biggest in Kenya in 70 years, according to the FAO.

If unchecked, locust numbers could grow 500 times by June, spreading to Uganda and South Sudan, and devastating crops and pasture in a region which is already one of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world.

Data from 732 locations in 43 countries spread across every inhabited continent revealed that, on average, 37 per cent of all heat-related deaths can be attributed directly to global warming.
The authors said their methods - if extended worldwide - would add up to more than 100,000 heat-related deaths per year laid squarely at the feet of manmade climate change.
IHME calculated just over 300,000 heat-related deaths worldwide from all causes in 2019.

Two people were missing and feared dead after the wind-driven Marshall Fire incinerated more than 1,000 dwellings on Dec 30-31, making it the most destructive Colorado blaze in record in terms of property losses.
Biden's trip to Boulder County, where he will tour a Louisville neighbourhood and meet with families displaced by the blaze, marks his second as president to Colorado and his second focused on wildfires.
The normal wildfire season in Colorado does not typically extend into the winter thanks to snow cover and bracing cold.
But climate change and rising global temperatures are leaving vegetation in parts of the western United States drier and more incendiary.","parts, wildfire, states, destructive, biden, towns, residents, blaze, missing, damage, visits, winter, tour, second, president, colorado",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

Last year, dry weather helped fuel record fires in the Pantanal, while the Amazon experienced the worst rash of blazes since 2017, according to Brazil's national space research institute INPE.
Scientists say their preservation is vital to curbing catastrophic climate change because of the vast amounts of greenhouse gas they absorb.
She and other scientists cautioned that no one knows for sure how much climate change is contributing to the changes in weather patterns.

373,20-Apr,"In a world of 7.8 billion hungry people, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered global fears about food supplies. Waves of panic buying have swept supermarket shelves clean and there are concerns the virus will sicken farmers and food factory workers, while shipments will be stalled by border controls.

In Malaysia, fishermen and vegetable farmers have had to dump their produce because they have not been able to get it to their customers, citing road blocks and a lack of manpower. Fortunately, some suppliers have linked up directly with online delivery services to get the produce to buyers.

So far, global food supplies and delivery are functioning. But concerns remain and the longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the fears of disruption.

The world's food system is already highly leveraged because of globalisation, with many nations reliant on imports and efficient transport and storage. The system is vulnerable to sudden shocks, which has led to unrest in the recent past.

In 2010, a combination of droughts and severe floods in key grain growing countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Russia, caused food shortages and price spikes that fuelled political unrest in the Middle East, triggering the Arab Spring.

Fish have become stranded in isolated pools in the Darling River amid a prolonged drought that has ravaged much of the sunburnt country's eastern interior.
Last summer, up to a million fish died in the same area of the river - part of the vast Murray-Darling Basin that is the lifeblood of Australia's food bowl.
Now the government has begun an effort to relocate thousands of fish to healthier sections of the river or into hatcheries.
Other fish will be removed from the river altogether, and placed into private and state-owned hatcheries until the water starts flowing again.","water, rescue, fish, summer, effort, state, million, deaths, river, australian, prompts, armageddon, sections, pools",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

413,19-Jul,"Many of the world's major cities will face sharply different climates by 2050, with those in the tropics such as Singapore and Jakarta facing conditions they have never experienced before, including more intense rainfall and extreme droughts, researchers say.

Cities are on the front line for climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels, heatwaves, droughts and threats to food security.

Half of the planet's population lives in cities and by 2050, little more than a generation away, three in four will live in urban areas, says the United Nations.

Singapore is boosting its defences and resilience. Last week, the Government announced it will pump $400 million over the next two years into upgrading and maintaining drains, and channel $10 million into studying sea level rise. These are just two of many measures meant to guard against a multitude of climate threats.

Researchers at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland wanted to find a way to visualise how climate change will affect major world cities. They chose 520 cities and examined the current climate for each, and then ran computer simulations for what the climate would be like in 2050.

The result is that the climate in 2050 for most cities shifts, in some cases dramatically.

London's climate resembles Barcelona's to the south. The Spanish city has longer, warmer summers and milder winters but is also prone to prolonged droughts. Seattle's climate becomes milder, resembling San Francisco's current climate, Moscow becomes more like Sofia, and Paris like Canberra.

Across Europe, summers and winters will get warmer, with northern climates becoming more like those in the south, the researchers found. The results were published earlier this month in the journal Plos One",Tropical cities will face 'unknown climates' by 2050,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/tropical-cities-will-face-unknown-climates-by-2050,"Many of the world's major cities will face sharply different climates by 2050, with those in the tropics such as Singapore and Jakarta facing conditions they have never experienced before, including more intense rainfall and extreme droughts, researchers say.

La Nina refers to the large-scale cooling of surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, occurring every two-to-seven years.
The UN agency said there was a 90-per cent chance of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures remaining at La Nina levels until the end of 2021 and a moderate chance, between 70-80 per cent, for them to persist at La Nina levels through the first quarter of 2022.

A study by the Met Office, the United Kingdom's's national meteorological service, warned that a 2 deg C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet.
A 4 deg C rise would mean that nearly half of the world's population could be living in affected areas, according to the research, released at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The Met Office used an indicator which combines warmth and humidity, known as wet-bulb temperature, to assess heat stress risk.

Poor land management practices also mean that soil can no longer hold sufficient organic matter or soak up CO2, Dr Cowie said. This has made farming a major part of the climate problem.

But this can change, she said. ""We can turn that around with more sustainable practices that would build soil carbon and take carbon out of the atmosphere.""

Dr Howden noted that farmers were already making changes. ""Small ones are changing cropping practices and breeds. The large ones are moving agricultural systems to different areas.""

""We have to become better at what we do. We need to become more efficient. We need to be thinking about managing increased variability of our climate. We need all of the tools, including seasonal forecasts, but also finance and government policy tools such as drought support,"" he said.

599,19-Apr,"President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a review of all government contracts with companies and other countries to remove ""onerous"" provisions that he said could harm Filipinos.

He instructed all government agencies at a Cabinet meeting on Monday to ""check and review all contracts... and remove onerous provisions that might be detrimental to the lives of Filipinos"", his spokesman Salvador Panelo told reporters yesterday.

It was unclear how many contracts would be up for review, or the scope of such investigations.

The order seems to stem from Mr Duterte's frustrations over a severe water shortage that hit large parts of metropolitan Manila for weeks last month.

Taps ran dry for some six million customers of privately held concessionaire Manila Water.

Executives of Manila Water owned up to the ""supply deficit situation"". They said they were caught unprepared when a key water source began to dry up following a prolonged dry spell, as they had insisted on servicing more customers than their infrastructure could handle.

Mr Duterte berated local water agency officials, and threatened to scrap the contracts of Manila Water and the capital's other concessionaire, Maynilad Water Services.

Mr Panelo said Mr Duterte was upset over a ruling in September last year by an arbitration court in Singapore that allowed Maynilad Water to claim over 3.4 billion pesos (S$88 million) in indemnity over rate hikes that the government had blocked in 2015 and 2016.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Mr Duterte found it unfair that the government would have to indemnify its concessionaires for delays in the implementation of water rate hikes, which ""unduly ties the hands"" of the government.

Mr Duterte then ordered the justice department to review the government's water concession agreements, as well as other ""onerous... contracts with private domestic companies"".

The burger chain also said it was working with the nonprofit Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to revamp its existing climate change targets.
United Nations scientists say the world's net emissions must fall to zero by 2050 to limit the rise in global temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius versus pre-industrial levels.
Net zero plans require companies to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and offset any remaining emissions using projects that capture the gas.

The Dixie blaze is the largest active wildfire in the United States, but one of only 11 major wildfires in California.
Over the weekend it surpassed the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire to make it the second-worst fire in state history, the authorities said.
By late July, the number of acres burned in California was up more than 250 per cent from 2020 - itself the worst year of wildfires in the state's modern history.
A long-term drought that scientists say is driven by climate change has left much of the western United States and Canada parched - and vulnerable to explosive and highly destructive fires.","acres, wildfire, states, state, dixie, area, united, missing, wildfires, left, secondworst, california, history",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

As a result, in some parts of the park, the grass favoured by the park's wildlife - including the one-horned rhino, deer and antelope - has partially or totally disappeared, he said.","nepals, rise, grasslands, parks, aliens, national, plant, wetlands, threaten, temperatures, oldest, shrestha, wildlife, chitwan, park, plants",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

Produced by the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA), the report brings together research on the world's largest rainforest from 200 scientists from across the globe.
The rainforest is a vital bulwark against climate change both for the carbon it absorbs and what it stores.
Furthermore the continued destruction caused by human interference in the Amazon puts more than 8,000 endemic plants and 2,300 animals at high risk of extinction, the report added.

Trump, who has described climate change as a hoax, has doubled down on support for polluting fossil fuels and revoked or rolled back a host of environmental standards.
Trump's signature act of climate disruption has ""already diminished our moral standing, taking us from a leader to the rear of the pack"", climate scientist Michael Mann told AFP.
Without US climate leadership ""I fear that the rest of the world will not take seriously enough their obligations to reduce emissions in time to avert the worst impacts of climate change,"" he said.

Gum tree leaves are koala's main food source, and restoring bushland and forest habitat razed in the 2019-2020 fires is key to their long-term survival in New South Wales state.
WWF's Australia unit is seeking to raise A$300 million (S$289 million) over five years to fund the initiative to try the seed drones and other methods to revive forest habitat, aiming to double koala numbers on the east coast.
Some of the WWF drones can plant 40,000 seeds a day and will help create corridors so that koalas and other wildlife can move across a landscape fragmented by fire and land clearing, Mr O'Gorman said in a statement.
In June, a parliamentary inquiry found that koalas in New South Wales state could become extinct by 2050 unless immediate action is taken to protect them and their habitat.","koala, gum, drop, million, koalas, wales, seed, drones, australia, south, trees, wildlife, wwf, seeds",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

One of the study's most alarming conclusions is that hikes in sea level caused by a disintegrating Antarctic ice sheet - which holds enough frozen water to boost oceans 58 metres - would become dramatically larger with each additional degree of warming.
Sea level rise, for example, would average about 1.3 metres for each of the first two degrees above pre-industrial levels.
But from 2 deg C to 6 deg C above that benchmark, the increase in sea level would double to 2.4 metres per degree of warming.
Beyond that, each added degree would result in 10 more metres, pushing the entire ice sheet past the point of no return and lifting oceans to levels not seen for millions of years.","shows, sea, seas, oceans, study, temperature, antarctica, lift, degree, level, metres, sheet, average, ice, climate, warming",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

It projected that on net, climate change will reduce real US GDP by an average of 0.03 per cent annually from 2020 to 2050, compared to what US growth would have been if global climate conditions remained the same as they were in 2000.
That reduction in the growth rate, accumulated over 30 years, lowers the CBO's projected level of real GDP output in 2050 by 1 per cent, the paper showed.
CBO researchers said that some aspects of climate change are incorporated quickly and directly, while others are more indirect and could take longer to manifest themselves.
But the overall capital stock would be smaller in the future, as a result of foregone investments to pay for the replacement costs, leading to less GDP output in the future, the CBO said.","projected, 30, longer, cbo, research, 2050, growth, change, 2000, gdp, budget, output, cut, economic, climate",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

I had some basil plants that seemed to be infected with mealy bugs and I threw them away subsequently. However, I kept the soil in which the plants were grown. Is it safe to reuse this soil?

Woon Siew Hung

It can be difficult to advise if the pest that attacked your basil plants earlier is not known.

To be safe, you may want to sterilise the soil before reusing it to grow new plants. The easiest way is perhaps to put the soil in a large bucket and pour in hot water. The soil suspension is then allowed to cool gradually. Then pour out the water and allow the soil to dry.

You will need to break the dried soil into smaller bits by using a hand hoe. Incorporate soil amendments such as good quality compost to improve the soil. Some gardeners also enrich potting soil with organic fertiliser before growing new plants with it.

1147,20-Jun,"US Senate approves sanctions Bill over Hong Kong

The US Senate on Thursday unanimously approved a Bill that would lay out sanctions on Chinese officials who undermine Hong Kong's autonomy as Beijing pushes forward with a controversial security law.

The House of Representatives still needs to pass the Bill, which would allow sanctions in the United States against Chinese officials and the Hong Kong police as well as banks that conduct ""significant transactions"" with them.

The vote comes as China presses forward with a security law that would enforce punishment over subversion and other perceived threats in Hong Kong, which saw massive protests last year in support of maintaining the financial hub's freedoms.

""They are moving forward in their process to take away the liberties of the people of Hong Kong. So time is of the essence,"" said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat who helped lead the charge on the bipartisan Bill.

The sweltering heat is only going to get more unbearable.

On average, it is almost 1 deg C hotter in Singapore today as compared to the 1950s.

Land retaken by the sea

Each year, sea levels rise by up to 5 millimetres, with greater increases near the equator. By 2100, the seas surrounding Singapore could rise by up to 1 metre.

With a third of the country less than 5 metres above sea level, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong estimated that at least S$100 billion will be needed over the next century to guard against rising seas.

Australia's opposition Labor Party had indicated it would broadly support the trade deals, although it would likely seek concessions around labour market access to appease its union members.

Mobile phone towers transmit radio signals that are disturbed when it rains, providing data that enables local weather agencies to improve the accuracy of their rainfall predictions.
The sheer number of mobile phone towers means the data can help provide forecasts of up to 90 per cent accuracy, said Tricarico, filling the equipment gap at no extra cost and giving more location-specific, high-resolution data than satellites provide.
The forecasts can be sent to farmers through calls and text messages, helping them plan when to sow their seeds or use fertilisers, said Damitha Gunawardena, digital inclusion manager at Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone operator, Dialog Axiata.
Improved forecasting is key to helping farmers deal with the impact of climate change, which is making weather patterns harder to predict, he said.","calls, messages, towers, thomson, predict, text, tricarico, weather, phone, rain, farmers, climate, mobile, data, forecasts",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

This plant is about 1m tall and grows in a pot. Its fruit looks like a mini green apple and has a single large seed like an apricot's. The flesh is sweet and crunchy. Does the plant have health or medicinal benefits?

The shrub is commonly known as the Indian jujube (botanical name: Ziziphus mauritiana).

It can be grown either as a shrub or a tree and it produces edible fruit. They are light green to yellow when immature. As they ripen, they turn reddish brown.

The plant requires a sunny location to thrive and appears to produce fruit more readily when grown in a large pot. Prune it periodically to manage its size when it is grown in a pot.

Keep the plant out of the reach of children and pets as well as exercise care when pruning it, as it has numerous thorns on its branches.

1450,19-Oct,"Pomegranate seedlings need direct sunlight to thrive

I have been trying to grow the pomegranate plant, but every time, it grows to only a certain height and its leaves start to turn yellow. Why is it so? How do I maintain it?

Eliana Tiong

Your pomegranate seedlings look rather lanky and stretched. This is a classic sign of a lack of sunlight.

Pomegranate is best grown under direct sunlight. In an apartment setting, ensure the seedlings are exposed to at least four to six hours of direct sunlight.

The media to raise these seedlings appears quite compacted and clayey. You may want to incorporate some organic matter, such as good quality compost or peat moss, into the mix to make it more friable.

A good starting point is to mix one part sifted soil and one part organic matter. Portions need to be adjusted accordingly to achieve the desired end product.

Organic matter can help to loosen the mix, increasing aeration and drainage, so that the mix allows the fine roots of seedlings to grow and develop.

Some fertiliser can also be given to boost the growth of the plants.

Song of India Dracaena may have fungal disease

I bought these two pots of Dracaena reflexa about three months ago and I water them on alternate days. They are placed in my balcony and get full sunlight. Recently, the leaves started to have brown patches. What is wrong with the plants?

Joe Lau

The leaves of your Song of India Dracaena (a cultivar of Dracaena reflexa) appear to be infected by a fungal disease.

You may want to prune affected leaves and spray a contact chemical fungicide such as Captan, which is available from local nurseries.

Fungal diseases can be a secondary infection that affects plants that have suffered injury.

In your case, check whether the sunlight which the plants are exposed to is too intense and if that could have caused sunburn and allowed infection to occur.

Often, new plants are produced in production nurseries under shadier conditions.

Such plants will need an acclimatisation period to get used to their final, growing environment.

Fancy leaf aglaonema thrives in bright and cool environment

What is the name of these plants? I bought them on the eve of Chinese New Year and was told to water them with a cup of water every five days. However, the next day, I noticed the leaves started to curve backwards. Is it due to a lack of water? The plants are placed on a table in my balcony, which experiences relatively strong wind during this time of the year.

Tan Elaine

The plants are a hybrid cultivar of aglaonema, commonly called the Chinese Evergreen. They are sometimes regarded as fancy leaf aglaonema which have attractive leaves in a range of colours.

These plants are best grown in a location where they can get four to six hours of filtered sunlight. Direct sunlight can be intense and can bleach and burn the leaves. Excessive heat can cause the leaves to curl as well.

The plants should not be grown in dense shade as they will not be receiving enough light to grow well. Plants will then be lanky and produce weak, floppy stems.

The frequency of watering will depend on factors such as the growing conditions, type of growing media and size of pot and plants.

You will need to water each plant thoroughly each time, such that excess water flows out of the drainage holes at the base of the pot.

In the case of the fancy leaf aglaonema, you should water once the growing media feels slightly dry. Do not allow the plants to totally dry out to the extent that they start to wilt.

Conversely, wet conditions can lead to the rotting of these plants.

Rapid agricultural expansion has led to widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, grasslands and other ecosystems and increased land degradation and desertification, leading to widespread soil erosion.
For example, soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be 10 to more than 100 times higher than the natural rate of soil formation.
- This has made the land more vulnerable to further erosion and greater extremes of heat, drought and floods caused by climate change.

Scientists believe that global warming has already caused so much melting at the south pole that the giant ice sheet is now on course to disintegrate, which would trigger an eventual global sea level rise of at least three metres over centuries.
""We have already awoken the giant at the southern pole,"" said Anders Levermann, a professor at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, referring to the ice sheet.
""We are already at a point of no return if we don't do anything,"" Levermann, who co-authored the study published in Science Advances, told Reuters.

1581,19-Jul,"CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO MAKING HEATWAVES LONGER

There's another way that climate change worsens heatwaves: by changing the jet stream. Those air currents in the atmosphere help move weather systems around and are driven by temperature differences, which are shrinking. So when heatwaves arrive, they stay in place longer.

""We're warming up the Arctic faster than the rest of the northern hemisphere,"" said MR Mann. ""So that's decreasing that temperature contrast from the subtropics to the pole, and it's that temperature contrast that drives the jet stream in the first place.""

At the same time, under certain circumstances the jet stream can get ""stuck"" between an atmospheric wall in the subtropics, and at the Arctic, trapping weather systems in place.

""That's when you get these record breaking weather events,"" said Mr Mann, ""either the unprecedented heatwave and drought, to wildfires and floods.""

This accounts for last summer's European heatwave, as well as the recent European heatwave, he says, and is behind the current North American heatwave.

Nationwide, the time period in which heatwaves might be expected to occur is 45 days longer than it was in the 1960s, according to the US Global Change Research Programme.

HEAT DEATHS MAY SOON SURPASS DEATHS FROM COLD WEATHER

According to the Cent res for Disease Control and Prevention, which uses methods most in accordance with global standards, currently, cold weather kills more people than hot weather does.

But as global temperatures increase, the number of deaths associated with extreme cold are predicted to decrease. At the same time, the number of deaths associated with extreme heat will increase. And those deaths, according to the National Climate Assessment, will exceed the decline in deaths from extreme cold, meaning an overall increase in mortality.

It's important to note that not everyone suffers equally when temperatures soar. In addition to the vulnerable groups, like elderly people, it also matters where you live. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analysed data from the 2000 census and found that people of colour were up to 52 per cent more likely to live in the hottest parts of cities.

Similarly, Mr Eric Klinenberg, the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University, found that during the 1995 Chicago heatwave that killed more than 700 people, the death tolls were highest in places that were not just poor and segregated, but what he calls ""institutionally depleted.""

""In a heatwave and many climate events, it's social isolation that proves to be truly dangerous,"" he said. ""If you're home and alone in a heatwave when you're old and frail you're more likely to die if you don't have air conditioning.""

The solution is reigning in greenhouse gas emissions, said Mr Mann.

If we don't, he said, ""think about the most extreme summer heat you've ever experienced in your lifetime. That will become a typical summer day by the middle of this century, if we continue on the path that we're on.","Heatwaves in the age of climate change: Longer, more frequent and more dangerous",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/heat-waves-in-the-age-of-climate-change-longer-more-frequent-and-more-dangerous,"CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO MAKING HEATWAVES LONGERThere's another way that climate change worsens heatwaves: by changing the jet stream.

His plan came the same day Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren proposed spending US$2 trillion on a new ""green manufacturing"" program to address climate change that would invest in research and exporting American clean energy technology.
Biden, a former vice-president, unveiled his plan after weeks of pressure from rivals and green activists who said he was not taking global warming seriously enough and would rely too heavily on Obama-era ideas.
The proposal would invest US$1.7 trillion over 10 years in clean energy research and modernising infrastructure to eliminate the emissions of the greenhouse gases that scientists blame for accelerating climate change and its effects - including rising sea levels, droughts, floods and more frequent powerful storms.

""Xi Jinping to visit DPRK"", read the headline, using the North's formal name.
The one-sentence story said that Xi would be making a state visit ""at the invitation of Kim Jong Un"", giving both men's national and party titles.
The trip by the leader of the North's key diplomatic ally and main provider of trade and aid has long been awaited, and comes after Kim travelled to China four times for meetings with Xi.","summit, rodong, jinping, north, visit, kim, party, korea, norths, xi, president, frontpage, pyongyang",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

He was accompanied by a clutch of senior officials, as Beijing looks to bolster North Korea a week before Mr Xi and US President Donald Trump are due to meet amid a bitter trade dispute.

Mr Kim Yeon-chul, the South Korean unification minister, said the rice shipment would be delivered through the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme before September to help North Korea during what are traditionally lean months.
He also dangled the prospect of more assistance, saying that South Korea would decide on ""the time and scale for additional food aid"" after reviewing ""the results of this round of support"".

That is why I was a bit disappointed in the last press conference because we don't play PlayStation (football) and you all know that.
The way we did it brought us where we are and if someone thinks we should now be 10 points ahead of City, I can't help this person.","sign, sticks, attacking, city, matches, conference, weak, ahead, guns, weekend, works, weakness, klopp, liverpool",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)
1737,19-Mar,"An ambitious ""30 by 30"" goal ",Making space for home-grown food,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/making-space-for-home-grown-food,"An ambitious ""30 by 30"" goal - to produce 30 per cent of Singapore's nutritional needs locally by 2030 - was announced in Parliament last week.
Given that Singapore imports more than 90 per cent of its food now, some citizens might greet with a degree of scepticism the prospect that almost one-third of the food that the country needs can be home-grown in just over a decade.
While that decision made sense in its time, the circumstances have changed not only for Singapore but also for the world at large.
The crux of the issue was encapsulated in the Global Food Security Index released last year.
But given that Singapore imports most of its food, climate change, conflict, trade disruptions and the like could disrupt its food security by affecting other food-producing countries.","30, food, security, needs, singapore, space, imports, singapores, given, homegrown, index, world, making",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

Nor is there any international agreement for the environment close to covering what the Paris accord does for climate.
It said that poor environmental conditions ""cause approximately 25 per cent of global disease and mortality"" - around 9 million deaths in 2015 alone.
The report says air pollution causes 6-7 million early deaths annually.
The report called for a root-and-branch detoxifying of human behaviour, while insisting that the situation is not unassailable.","global, pollution, water, human, report, poor, geo, million, health, disease, deaths, damage, emissions, landmark, environment",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)

1741,19-Mar,"LONDON • Britain's vote to leave the European Union has already come at a cost, regardless of where Brexit goes from here. Some of the damage is tangible, such as jobs, investment and capital; some of it less so, like international clout and talent.

Prime Minister Theresa May's defeat again in Parliament on Tuesday leaves Britain needing to delay Brexit. The EU, though, must agree to it and officials in Brussels have warned that there will be no further renegotiation.

Meanwhile, the threat of economic pain still looms over the country. And the political impasse remains as entrenched as ever, even after Parliament also voted to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.

Here's a look at where the biggest impact has been so far.

THE ECONOMY

The vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has cost the United Kingdom about £800 million (S$1.44 billion) per week, or about 2 per cent of total economic output, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said last month.

Optimism among firms is at its lowest in seven years, according to Lloyds Banking Group, and businesses have recorded the longest continuous decline in investment since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Not all of this investment will be recovered even if there is a smooth exit process, the central bank warns.

The pound is down more than 10 per cent against the euro since Britain voted to leave the EU. That has increased the cost of imported goods and services, boosting inflation and eroding purchasing power for consumers. British exporters, meanwhile, have failed to take advantage of the weaker pound to grow their market share.

FINANCE

""Climate change is worse than Voldemort,"" read one student's handmade sign, referring to the evil wizard in the hugely popular Harry Potter books and films.
The marches are part of a worldwide student strike movement, which started in August 2018 when 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting outside her Parliament on school days.
More than 100 students planned to gather in Seoul for a protest.
In Singapore, where there are strict laws regulating public assembly, youths planned a virtual campaign on social media.","global, read, student, wellington, nz, students, strike, change, australian, planned, kick, youths, school, thousands, climate, zealand",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (droughts)
