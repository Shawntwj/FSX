Within the workforce, middle-aged workers also still account for the majority of those who experienced income deterioration.
A persistent increase was also observed in the unemployment rate of middle-aged workers.
These findings suggest that middle-aged workers will continue to face challenges, and therefore require sustained policy support, DBS said.","customers, policy, recovery, middleaged, group, struggling, dbs, sporeans, support, workers, financial, experienced, cent, lowerincome, income, amid, covid19",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

The growth rate was the lowest registered in all of the country's seven previous official population surveys, dating to 1953.
Mr Ning said that there were 12 million births last year, and the country's fertility rate was 1.3.

Britain requires banks to ""ring-fence"" the retail arms of their operations to shield them from any problems in their riskier, investment banking arms.
Proprietary trading refers to banks buying and selling stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than on behalf of a client.
The review was called for by the finance ministry and the independent panel is chaired by City veteran Keith Skeoch.
Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec 31 means it no longer has to comply with the bloc's financial rules, freeing it up to tailor regulation to UK lenders.","reviews, wider, trading, changes, sector, britain, review, core, independent, banks, financial, rules, brexit, uk, light, banking",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

In 2020, banks doled out a total of 19.6 trillion yuan (S$4 trillion) of credit, with about a fifth directed to inclusive financing such as small business loans.
The PBOC wants banks to focus on lending to areas such as innovative technology and the manufacturing sector, it said at the March gathering.

171,Oct-20,"WASHINGTON • The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said yesterday that forecasts for the global economy were ""somewhat less dire"" as wealthy countries and China rebounded more quickly than expected from coronavirus lockdowns, but warned that the outlook was worsening for many emerging markets.

The IMF forecast a 2020 global contraction of 4.4 per cent in its latest World Economic Outlook, an improvement from a 5.2 per cent contraction predicted in June, when business closures reached their peak. It is still the worst economic crisis since the 1930s Great Depression, it said.

The global economy will return to growth of 5.2 per cent next year, the IMF said, but the rebound will be slightly weaker than forecast in June, partly due to the extreme difficulties for many emerging markets and slowing reopening momentum as the virus continues to spread.

233,Jun-20,"LONDON • European Central Bank (ECB) officials are drawing up a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The project, which comes as Europe mobilises trillions of euros to bolster the region's economy, is aimed at shielding commercial banks from any second fallout from the crisis, if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to repay loans.

One of the people familiar with the plan said the ECB had set up a task force to look at the idea of a ""bad bank"" to warehouse unpaid euro debt and that work on the plan had accelerated in recent weeks.

The ECB declined to comment on whether it was working on a bad bank scheme. The amount of debt in the euro zone that is considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid already stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, according to official statistics.

That is set to rise as the outbreak squeezes borrowers and could even double to one trillion euros, weighing on already fragile banks and hindering new lending, the people familiar with the ECB plans said.

While the idea for a euro zone bad bank was discussed and shelved over two years ago, the ECB, under president Christine Lagarde, has consulted banks and European Union officials about a scheme in recent weeks, one of the people said.

One blueprint under discussion would involve the European Stability Mechanism, an EU institution which can provide financial assistance to euro zone countries or lenders, standing in as guarantor for the bad bank, the people said.

The bad bank would then issue bonds which commercial banks would buy in exchange for portfolios of unpaid loans, neutralising the virus shock for Europe's lenders. The banks could then lodge those bonds with the ECB as collateral for central bank funding, one of the people said.

Major European commercial banks could be called on to join forces to underpin the scheme, the second person said.

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to rise to the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, from November's 49.9.
The relative strength in the Caixin PMI tallied with an official survey released last Friday that showed China's factory activity had edged up.
Factory output increased at the fastest pace in a year, the private survey showed, helped by easing price pressures.
Last year, debt crises at major real estate developers amid a crackdown on the property sector had also hurt an industry critical to China's economic growth.","activity, returns, chinas, growth, easing, level, survey, pace, factory, economic, showed, market, covid19",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

If the global sourcing networks for such inputs undergo an unexpected and unfavourable reconfiguration, there may be a painful economic adjustment needed here in coming years.
Travel curbs have also cut down the supply of workers, worsening the increasing skills disparities and mismatch, pushing up wages as another source of higher business costs.
Also, labour force participation rates have been falling worldwide in ageing economies like Singapore.
Such longer-term structural impacts of the pandemic are a source of concern for both policymakers and companies, especially those with a large global footprint.","global, reset, supply, spore, singapore, pandemic, weather, concern, worldwide, recent, disruptions, chain, source, economic, set, rates, covid19",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

533,Jan-21,"WASHINGTON • Ten months after the coronavirus crisis decimated the United States labour market, the resurgent pandemic keeps sending shock waves through the economy.

Though more than half of the 22 million jobs lost last spring have been regained, a new surge of infections has prompted shutdowns and layoffs that have hit the leisure and hospitality industries especially hard, dealing a setback to the recovery.

The latest evidence came on Thursday when the Labour Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, exceeding one million for the first time since July.

Just days earlier, the government announced that employers had shed 140,000 jobs last month, the first net decline in employment since last spring, with restaurants, bars and hotels recording steep losses.

""We're in a deep economic hole, and we're digging in the wrong direction,"" said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao.

""The report obviously shows that the rise in claims is worse than expected, and there is reason to think that things are going to get worse before they are going to get better.""

In the first quarter of this year, private home prices rose 2.9 per cent, the steepest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2018.

This is clearly not in line with the growth of resident income and economic fundamentals.

The Government must act promptly to maintain a stable and sustainable property market for Singaporeans.

One measure it could consider would be to tighten the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limit further. This would have multiple benefits.

First, the current interest rate environment can lead to a significant mispricing of assets, and tightening the TDSR would reduce the risk of Singaporeans overleveraging to purchase properties.

This, in turn, would lower the systemic risk that may be posed to the financial system by overleveraged individuals, given continued uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and the direction of interest rates.

Second, reducing the amount of capital locked up in property allows it to be deployed to more productive uses. This capital could be used instead to invest in businesses to help them grow.

So where are the winners and losers in this scenario of a transition to a cleaner, greener world of mobility?

One obvious place to start when considering the winners is to consider the resourcing question, says BNY Mellon Investment Management. Here, the team notes that over time, the world's producers of copper, cobalt, rare earth elements, graphite, nickel, aluminium and lithium will likely benefit from increased demand.

Battery providers and electronics firms also stand to gain as these companies may benefit from the increase in the number of EVs being manufactured, and therefore higher demand for the technology powering them.

In contrast, the traditional auto parts industry may lose out in the longer term as pure EV penetration increases. Largely, this is a function of the increased simplicity of EVs versus ICE cars. With no need for carburetors, fuel injectors, pistons, pumps, filters and all the associated paraphernalia of petrol combustion, there is hence less need for the companies producing such paraphernalia.

Chief among these should no doubt be fintech investments (Spike in investments into S'pore-based fintech firms, June 22) coming hot on the heels of the increasing infatuation with fintech (Coronavirus: More consumers, companies embracing tech, May 10) and last year's stellar growth in fintech investments (S'pore fintech investments more than doubled to $1.2b last year, Feb 21).
Thought leaders suggest that achieving this balance involves calibrating the competing goals of supporting the growth of fintech with the regulatory goals of financial stability and consumer protection, and the key will be to adopt innovative and smarter digital regulatory systems.
This means going beyond mere adoption of technology to digitalise regulatory, compliance and reporting processes, to developing strong information technology capabilities - including in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.
This would allow for the analysis of relevant leading indicators such as those of financial instability and regulatory non-compliance, to provide regulators with greater predictive ex ante capabilities to pre-emptively fight fraud.","tech, forum, spore, keeping, important, singapore, growth, financial, investments, reporting, pace, goals, regulatory, fintech, technology, covid19",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

Even billions of dollars in global fiscal stimulus are struggling to cushion the blow as the pandemic worsens generational inequality.

Take Australia as an example. Despite a A$260 billion (S$252 billion) injection of financial and economic support, unemployment among those between the ages of 15 and 24 has surged to 16.1 per cent, compared with about 5.5 per cent for those over 25. That is in a country that has not seen a recession since the 1990s and is in the vanguard of nations containing the virus.

About a quarter of younger workers are not eligible for the Australian government's flagship wage subsidy package because they are on casual contracts and have not been employed for 12 months, according to Ms Catherine Birch, a senior economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. That compares with just 6.5 per cent for all other age groups.

Mr Elliot Matthews, 21, is one of the unlucky ones. In April, when he learnt there would be no more shifts at the Sydney hotel where he worked, he was just two weeks short of a year's employment. ""That's a very hard window to fit into,"" Mr Matthews said of the government requirement. ""While it's a dark time for everyone, a lot of people are falling through the cracks.""

Even so, the emergency supplies are expected to last only a few days.
In recent weeks, Iran has sent fuel by tanker ship to Syria, where Hezbollah organized caravans to drive it into Lebanon.
Visiting Lebanon last week, Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said Iran was ready to build two new power plants in Beirut and southern Lebanon able to meet a third of the country's electricity demands.","fuel, electricity, power, lebanese, supplies, restored, national, army, plants, lebanon, iran, sent, minister, emergency",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

Coal-fired power generation accounts for nearly 70 per cent of China's electricity.
Efforts to rein in industrial overcapacity and stricter safety and environment requirements have slashed China's coal output since 2016.

The Senior Minister also stressed the high stakes involved for Singapore in how it responds to crises.
""Singapore can hold its own in the world only if we are strong, successful and united at home,"" he said.
Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, outlined three aspects of Singapore's resilience in dealing with Covid-19 - in its crisis response, economic resilience and social resilience.
First, in terms of its crisis response, Mr Teo said Singapore had to scale up its capacity to deal with infected patients rapidly.","shows, resilience, reserves, singapore, building, hean, pandemic, strong, singapores, senior, importance, stressed, minister, chee, teo, world, crisis, covid19",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

Powell's prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee largely echoed the cautionary tone he struck last week at the conclusion of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, mapping out how the United States faces an uncertain, uneven and prolonged economic recovery from the health crisis.
Millions of people have become unemployed as a result of the epidemic, which has killed more than 116,000 people in the United States, with minority communities among those hardest hit on both fronts.
Powell was repeatedly asked how the Fed could mitigate the impacts of such racial inequality.
But he cautioned there would be no quick fix to healing the economy, particularly for low-wage workers in service sector industries that have been hardest hit.","long, economy, states, recovery, unemployment, shoots, road, welcome, united, powell, hit, economic, largely, feds, green",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

While there is little evidence so far that investors, large companies or expat residents are rushing to move their money, the emergence of China's national security Bill and the United States response that it can no longer certify Hong Kong's political autonomy is stoking concern.

The developments come after Hong Kong in the past year was pushed into a deep economic crisis triggered by political upheaval and, since late January, the coronavirus outbreak. The growing worry is that Beijing's latest intervention will finally undermine confidence in the city's prized legal system.

The announcement on Wednesday by US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Hong Kong raises the potential for far-reaching consequences for the city's special trading status with the US.
One gauge of stress in Hong Kong's financial system is the flow of capital and whether companies and savers pull their money out.

The head of state summoned Mr Draghi for talks on Wednesday at noon (7pm Singapore time) after hearing that efforts to salvage the collapsed coalition of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had failed.
Mr Draghi is widely credited with pulling the euro zone back from the brink of collapse in 2012, pledging to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the single European currency.
Mr Draghi made no immediate comment on the presidential summons and it was not initially clear which parties in the deeply fractured parliament would support an administration he headed.
While Forza Italia was widely expected to rally to Draghi's side, Brothers of Italy indicated that it would remain in opposition.","save, italys, president, crisis, calls, chief, european, support, mario, mattarella, draghi, country, coalition, italy, party, mr, execb, administration, economic",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

Japanese carmakers have scrapped plans to expand in Britain, in part because Brexit undermines the country's virtues as a hub for European trade.
The deadlock only deepened on Monday (April 1), as Britain's Parliament failed to reach consensus on the latest Brexit proposals.

The deal eliminates the need for a factory in Britain because Honda can now ship cars made in Japan directly into Europe without incurring duties.
If Britain leaves the European market, it would lose the benefits of the bloc's trade deals.
In short, just as Japan and Europe are liberalising trade with each other, Britain is moving to impede trade with both.

885,Mar-19,"LONDON • Britain's vote to leave the European Union has already come at a cost, regardless of where Brexit goes from here. Some of the damage is tangible, such as jobs, investment and capital; some of it less so, like international clout and talent.

Prime Minister Theresa May's defeat again in Parliament on Tuesday leaves Britain needing to delay Brexit. The EU, though, must agree to it and officials in Brussels have warned that there will be no further renegotiation.

Meanwhile, the threat of economic pain still looms over the country. And the political impasse remains as entrenched as ever, even after Parliament also voted to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.

Here's a look at where the biggest impact has been so far.

THE ECONOMY

The vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has cost the United Kingdom about £800 million (S$1.44 billion) per week, or about 2 per cent of total economic output, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said last month.

Optimism among firms is at its lowest in seven years, according to Lloyds Banking Group, and businesses have recorded the longest continuous decline in investment since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Not all of this investment will be recovered even if there is a smooth exit process, the central bank warns.

The pound is down more than 10 per cent against the euro since Britain voted to leave the EU. That has increased the cost of imported goods and services, boosting inflation and eroding purchasing power for consumers. British exporters, meanwhile, have failed to take advantage of the weaker pound to grow their market share.

The seizure was made in accordance to the Airport Authority Ordinance, the government body said in an email on Tuesday (Dec 17), citing a section of the rules that addresses overdue charges.
Hong Kong Airlines, whose fleet consists of 39 Airbus SE planes, said that some of its aircraft haven't been scheduled for operation and were suspended from service under the Airport Authority's arrangement.

The Twitter co-founder said in a tweet that Block, formerly known as Square, is ""officially building an open Bitcoin mining system"", following through on an idea floated publicly late last year.
In November, Mr Dorsey announced his departure from the social media platform, allowing him to concentrate on his digital payments firm as it expands into cryptocurrency.
Block changed its name from Square late last year to denote a broader mission that includes blockchain and economic empowerment.

996,Aug-20,"That is why we have made a concerted effort to value a wide range of talent. Schools and institutes of higher learning admit students through yardsticks other than academic results. The Public Service Commission has widened its catchment of scholars.

Employers are encouraged to hire people based on skills, with the public service taking the lead. Political parties are fielding candidates who took different life paths and have diverse talents and strengths.

This is also why we must continue to invest heavily in education and training, from the earliest years of childhood through the schooling years. We are developing many pathways, so that young Singaporeans can achieve their fullest potential regardless of their starting point.

And through the next bound of SkillsFuture, we will enable every worker to upskill and progress throughout their career, beyond their initial qualifications. Employers must support lifelong learning as the new norm. Society must value people for what they contribute, in every job and every role.

Building a fair and just society goes beyond government actions. It requires the support and participation of all Singaporeans. It turns on how we look after our most vulnerable members, such as helping students from disadvantaged families through Uplift and KidStart, providing training and job opportunities for people with disabilities, and bridging the digital divide for our seniors.

We have made progress over the last decade, and we will do much more in this term of Government to see our people through this crisis and beyond. The more closely knit we are as a people, the further we can move ahead as a nation.

STRENGTHENING OUR SINGAPOREAN IDENTITY

In the longer term, the key to Singapore's success lies in our sense of shared identity. Singapore can endure and secure her place in history only if Singaporeans feel passionately about our country, and put our hearts and souls into making this a better home.

Since independence, we have gradually built a distinctive Singaporean culture and identity. Regardless of race, language and religion, we all think of ourselves as Singaporeans. You can see this in our attitudes, memories and experiences; it is in our arts and heritage, and the way we cheer for Team Singapore together. You see it in the way we can gladly identify one another in an unfamiliar foreign land, and the way we have each other's backs in a crisis.

These are emotional ties that are strengthened over the years.

There is still much more to do to strengthen the sense of togetherness in our society. We must start young and shape the multicultural instincts in our children early in life; our approaches and methods must therefore evolve with the outlook and attitudes of the young. We must then sustain this mindset across our communities and workplaces.

We must also recognise that larger forces are at play that test our solidarity and pull us in different directions. The social media has amplified contending voices and views. We are more exposed than ever to causes, attitudes and values from other societies that may not be relevant to our social context, but will influence us nonetheless.

Another potentially divisive issue closely connected to our Singaporean identity is the sense of competition for jobs from work pass holders.
Our Singaporean identity has been formed and strengthened not by excluding those who arrive later, but by successive arrivals adding to the richness of our society.

1002,Jun-19,"More than 252,000 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs) are working for an estimated 200,000 families in Singapore.

Many FDWs do have financial problems back home.

When the family of an FDW experiences a financial crisis, she has little option but to resort to borrowing.

Besides borrowing from friends, the only viable option is to take a loan from a moneylending company and, regretfully, some borrow from unlicensed moneylenders.

Most FDWs dare not borrow from their employers for fear that the latter might terminate their employment.

FDWs we interviewed shared their concerns that employers may perceive them to be not mentally sound to do their work properly in their current state.

Though the repayment of loans by FDWs to facilitate their employment here is one of the reasons for the FDWs to be saddled with debt, it is by no means the main reason for them to borrow.

From our interaction with FDWs, the main reason stems from the inability of many FDWs to meet the financial needs of their families back home.

More so when there is a crisis such as sickness or natural disaster. The crisis situation is more pronounced when the FDW is the main or sole breadwinner.

We have to bear in mind that FDWs' contribution to our economy cannot be taken for granted.

Their presence frees parents to pursue their careers and enables all to be economically active as our children, seniors and homes are being looked after.

We can do more to help them. Proper education should be made available and accessible to FDWs to help them understand the consequences of borrowing.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will also extend accordingly the MAS Singapore Dollar Facility for Enterprise Singapore Loans, which provides lower-cost funding for banks and finance companies to support their lending to local enterprises.","extended, schemes, loan, enhanced, bridging, singapore, support, trade, cent, smes, temporary, enterprise, mas, financing, till",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

1014,Jul-20,Job seekers in Singapore are seeing signed employment contracts rescinded as businesses cut back on hiring during the coronavirus pandemic,S'pore job offers being cancelled amid recession: Recruiters,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/spore-job-offers-being-cancelled-amid-recession-recruiters,"Job seekers in Singapore are seeing signed employment contracts rescinded as businesses cut back on hiring during the coronavirus pandemic-triggered recession, recruiters say.
There was a spike in cases of companies cancelling job offers in late March and early April, said Mr Rob Bryson, managing director of recruitment agency Robert Walters Singapore.
The day before he was due to start, the firm told him it had ""ceased"" the contract because of the economic blow from Covid-19.
Mr Bryson said there has been a general downturn in hiring and a slowdown in the process.
Businesses ""will only start the hiring process if they have a clear internal mandate to do so, rather than making speculative hires"", he said.","recession, start, manager, offers, singapore, spore, hiring, firm, job, mr, cancelled, second, regional, businesses, amid, recruiters",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis

""It will be a great embarrassment to the USA,"" he tweeted of the election, asserting without evidence that mail-in voting would lead to fraud.
The most powerful leaders in Congress immediately shot down the idea of moving the election, including the top figures in Mr Trump's own party.
""We'll cope with whatever the situation is and have the election on Nov 3 as already scheduled.""
Instead, Mr Trump has been absent this week from economic relief talks, even as a crucial unemployment benefit is poised to expire and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned publicly that the country's recovery is lagging.","losing, power, nov, election, congress, mr, trump, trumps, presidential, risk, president, economic, attacks",Man-Made Disaster,Economic Crisis
