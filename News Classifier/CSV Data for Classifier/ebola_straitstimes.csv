0,Sep-21,NEW YORK (REUTERS) ,Johnson & Johnson reports promising Ebola vaccine data,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/johnson-johnson-reports-promising-ebola-vaccine-data,"NEW YORK (REUTERS) - Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said on Monday (Sept 13) its Ebola vaccine regimen demonstrated antibody immune responses in adults and children, citing data published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.
The regimen, Zabdeno and Mvabea, generated immune responses that persisted in adults for at least two years.
""The peer-reviewed data supports the prophylactic use of the Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine regimen to protect people at risk of Ebola, which is essential to our vision of preventing Ebola outbreaks before they can begin,"" J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.
Ebola typically kills about half of those it infects, although vaccines and new treatments have proven highly effective in reducing fatality rates.
J&J's vaccine regimen had received European approval in July 2020 and prequalification from WHO, which allows medicines to be procured by developing countries, in April 2021.","promising, responses, outbreaks, reports, johnson, ebola, regimen, induced, vaccine, immune, data, jj",Human health crises,pandemic

As of Wednesday, there was one confirmed and three suspected cases in Ivory Coast that later tested negative, WHO said.
The 18-year-old patient travelled from the Labe region in Guinea, near the border with Senegal, to Abidjan, on public transport.
The teen developed a fever after leaving her home in rural Guinea.

3,Jun-21,DAKAR (AFP) ,Guinea to declare end to Ebola epidemic,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/guinea-to-declare-end-to-ebola-epidemic,"DAKAR (AFP) - Guinea is set to announce an end to the Ebola epidemic in the West African state this weekend, the country's health minister said Thursday (June 17).
Speaking during a webinar hosted by the World Health Organisation, Health Minister Remy Lamah said the viral epidemic will be declared over on Saturday - barring the discovery of new cases.
Guinea announced an Ebola outbreak on Feb 14, evoking spectres of the devastating 2013-2016 West Africa epidemic, which left 11,300 dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
According to the WHO, Ebola has infected at least 16 people and claimed five lives since February in Guinea, where the disease reappeared in the forested Nzerekore region in the southeast of the impoverished nation.
On Thursday, Lamah credited the speed of the health response for getting the outbreak under control.","outbreak, guinea, disease, epidemic, lamah, minister, worst, end, ebola, west, health, declare",Human health crises,pandemic

11,Jul-20,"NEW YORK • The World Health Organisation (WHO) raised the alarm on Thursday about a growing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and warned of an imminent shortage of funds to fight the deadly disease.

The organisation said 56 cases have been reported in Equator province, more than the total number of cases recorded in the province's last outbreak in 2018.

Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic have complicated the response to the Ebola outbreak, according to Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.

13,Feb-20,"With coronavirus cases exploding in China, the US is once again responding to a global epidemic. Five years ago, when the Ebola virus infected more than 28,000 people in 10 countries, many people were surprised to learn that four of these cases were diagnosed on US soil.

Based on research I conducted for a book about the Ebola crisis and prejudice against certain groups of people associated with it, I fear that Americans might make immigrants, instead of the virus, the villain during the coronavirus epidemic.

There is reason for concern. Since the first case of the coronavirus was discovered last December, it has affected more than 37,000 people, including 12 in the US.

If the US' experience with epidemics tell us anything, it is that these events will be followed by increased public attention aimed at immigrants from China. This is because during epidemics, attention is typically focused on groups from countries where they started. And, this attention is rarely accompanied by an understanding of immigrants' complicated experiences.

More often, it is about blame. Chinese immigrants in Canada already are reporting examples of xenophobia. Several students at the University of California, Berkeley complained about what they considered to be a xenophobic Instagram post from the university following news of the coronavirus; the university deleted the post.

As I argue, based on research presented in my book Global Epidemics, Local Implications: African Immigrants And The Ebola Crisis In Dallas, the experience of African immigrants during the Ebola epidemic in 2014 can provide us with important lessons about how the US and its people should respond.

This does not imply that the Ebola virus and the new coronavirus are similar.

Yet, there are important facets of African immigrants' experiences during the Ebola crisis that can inform how Americans think about the current experiences of Chinese immigrants.

FEAR AND CONCERN FOR LOVED ONES FAR AWAY

For starters, the public tends to ignore the fears and traumas experienced by immigrants who see epidemics unfolding in their origin countries.

Some immigrants experience the devastation first hand, because they had travelled to their countries of origin when the outbreak occurred. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, for example, African immigrants visiting West Africa when the outbreak began lived through the ensuing social disorder, witnessed the rising death toll and feared infection from the virus.

More often, however, immigrants experience outbreaks from afar. During the Ebola epidemic, my research shows that immigrants who remained in the US were not spared from these emotional experiences. While advances in global travel and communications technology have helped immigrants maintain connections with these countries, they also provide channels through which the consequences of disease outbreaks abroad are experienced.

News of the mounting deaths of family members created a paralysing feeling for immigrants in the US who knew that they could not risk travelling to the endemic countries abroad. At the same time, they felt guilty about their inability to participate in customary burial rites.

BUT WORST OF ALL, BLAME

In addition to fear and guilt, however, immigrants often experience a great deal of blame. During the Ebola crisis, negative responses from Americans who used caricatures of immigrants' ethnicity to stigmatise them as carriers of disease only worsened immigrants' stress and fear. For example, many heard racist tropes about Africans' presumed penchant for kissing corpses and their habit of consuming exotic beasts.

In this current coronavirus epidemic, we have already begun to see the rise of xenophobia and the use of ethnic stereotypes about Chinese consumption of exotic meats to link the presumed cultural practices of Chinese immigrants with the spread of the virus",Fighting fear with empathy: Lessons from how Africans got blamed for Ebola,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/fighting-fear-with-empathy-lessons-from-how-africans-got-blamed-for-ebola,"This does not imply that the Ebola virus and the new coronavirus are similar.

Ebola drugs were particularly difficult to identify because the disease often struck quickly, going back undercover before clinicians had the opportunity to finish testing potential treatments.

""An urban case means that it can spread quickly. That is another challenge,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told Wednesday's session during the agency's annual World Health Assembly.

The proximity of the outbreak to neighbouring countries, especially through the river connection, was a major concern, he said.

At the same time, though, the top WHO officials and DRC's ambassador to the UN in Geneva Zenon Mukongo Ngay, who spoke at the event, stressed the massive efforts put in place to halt the outbreak.

Dr Salama said in just the two weeks since the outbreak was declared, clinical care facilities have been set up, an air bridge has been established to Bikoro, emergency financing has been mobilised, protective gear and emergency medical kits have been supplied.

In addition, a vaccination campaign has begun and more than 120 WHO staff alone have been deployed alongside numerous staff from other organisations under the leadership of the DRC government.

""It is hard to recall a situation of an outbreak where a government has responded more quickly and more decisively than in this outbreak,"" he said.

A campaign using an experimental vaccine got underway this week, starting with first responders, before moving to any people known to have been in contact with suspected cases, and then on to the contacts of the contacts.

""This is not mass immunisation, this is highly targeted ring vaccination,"" Dr Salama said, pointing out that the aim was to form ""protective rings around (each) case to protect the people themselves, but also to prevent further community transmission"".

He told AFP that some 10,000 people should be vaccinated within the next month.

Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa, meanwhile said WHO response teams have been sent to most of the nine surrounding countries to ensure they are sufficiently prepared in case the virus spreads beyond DRC.

The institute collects genetic material from wildlife for experimentation at its Wuhan lab.
Scientists and others have developed hypotheses based on general concerns about the risks involved in live virus lab research, clues in the virus' genome, and information from studies by institute researchers.","origins, facility, know, researchers, mystery, viruses, scientists, research, unsolved, genome, lab, wuhan, institute, covid19, virus",Human health crises,pandemic

""It really is an existential crisis for WHO,"" added Mr Jha, co-author of a 2015 report calling for sweeping reform of the global agency.
WHO officials often lament their funding constraints, but Mr Jha said financing issues are caused by the fact that ""donors don't fundamentally trust WHO to do a great job"".

Over 18 days, 68 per cent of the patients improved, with 17 of the 30 patients on mechanical ventilation being able to get off the breathing device.
Several large-scale clinical trials are underway to evaluate the benefit of remdesivir for Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 1.65 million people worldwide and killed 100,000.
Another, sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, has enrolled patients rapidly as the virus spread throughout the US.

""One person who has recently been diagnosed has been in contact with you,"" the script told her to say.
Massachusetts is the first state to invest in an ambitious contact-tracing program, budgeting US$44 million (S$62.8 million) to hire 1,000 people like Cross.
This could help Massachusetts in the coming weeks and months as it seeks to relax strict social distancing measures and reopen its economy.","million, digital, minutes, army, baker, youfortyfive, shape, massachusetts, coronavirus, tracers, cross, contact, takes, state, virus",Human health crises,pandemic

However, remdesivir had previously been shown to be protective in monkeys infected with the Ebola virus, but that did not translate to humans.
NIAID scientists tested remdesivir in monkeys 24 hours prior to infection with Mers and in other monkeys 12 hours after infection - the time frame in monkeys when the virus is most active.
In the monkeys treated prior to infection, the drug appeared to prevent disease.
A state-run Chinese research institute applied last week for a patent to use Gilead's experimental drug against the new coronavirus.","gilead, trials, china, researchers, drug, raises, infected, coronavirus, group, monkeys, prevents, research, remdesivir, hope, mers, infection, type, virus",Human health crises,pandemic
