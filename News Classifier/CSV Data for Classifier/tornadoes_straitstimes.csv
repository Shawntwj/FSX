The National Weather Service in Jackson received several reports of tornadoes in the area, and at least two of them prompted ""tornado emergency"" warnings, which are issued only for ""dangerous tornadoes that could produce catastrophic damage"", said Mr John Moore III, a meteorologist with the service.

Officials will not know the tornadoes' exact paths or strengths until teams can be sent to survey the damage in the coming days, but radar did pick up a clue: debris lift.

The tornadoes were produced by severe thunderstorms, Mr Moore said, noting that more of these thunderstorms were moving through the same area and could produce additional tornadoes. ""April is our primary severe weather season for Mississippi,"" he said. These types of storms are typically seen this time of the year, but ""strong tornadoes anywhere are rare"", he added.

43,Mar-20,"“TAKE COVER NOW! THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS STORM!!!” the National Weather Service tweeted as one tornado tore through an area west of Nashville.

Television broadcast showed cars piled up, hangars destroyed and what appeared to be dozens of aircraft smashed into each other at Nashville’s John C. Tune Airport.

The Nashville Police Department circulated aerial photographs of many buildings missing roofs and homes destroyed – standing next to houses that escaped damage.

“In the hours ahead, we will continue deploying search and rescue teams, opening shelters across the state, and sending emergency personnel to our communities hit hardest,” Governor Bill Lee wrote on Twitter.

Mr Lee said late Tuesday that the toll had risen to 25 during the day.

Among the victims were two people in Nashville killed after being struck by debris, police said.

Mayor John Cooper said around 150 people had been transported to medical facilities while nearly 50 buildings had collapsed in the city, the hub of the US country music scene.

US President Donald Trump said that he would visit the stricken areas on Friday.

“We send our love and our prayers of the nation to every family that was affected, and we will get there and we will recover and we will rebuild and we will help them,” Mr Trump said.

The series of severe storms that passed through Tennessee caused major damage to buildings, roads, bridges, utilities and businesses, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) said.

“Tornado damage has been reported throughout West and Middle Tennessee including downtown Nashville,” it added.

Overturned tractor trailers and other vehicles littered interstate highways.

'THE HOUSE JUST EXPLODED'

In the city’s East Nashville neighborhood, resident David Haskell said that he and his wife bolted into their storm shelter after an alarm on their phone went off.

“Ten seconds later. the house just exploded,” he told the local Tennessean newspaper, standing in front of his home, with its crumbled walls and destroyed roof.

Mr Cooper wrote on Twitter that “Nashville is hurting, and our community has been devastated”, as he urged people to lend a helping hand.

More than 73,000 customers were without power amid scattered storms throughout the day, TEMA reported.

Tennessee is one of 14 states voting in the crucial Super Tuesday primaries, which will help determine the Democratic Party nominee for November’s presidential election.

Mr Cooper told a news conference that 15 polling stations had been affected by storm damage, less than 10 per cent of the total.

Some polling stations would stay open until 10pm Central time (0400 GMT Wednesday), a local judge ruled, to allow those affected by the tornado to vote.

The Democratic candidates vying to take on Mr Trump in November’s election were quick to acknowledge the disaster.

“We have been watching the news coming out of Tennessee with heavy hearts,” former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg tweeted.

A family representative said Paxton died of complications after surgery. It was not immediately known what procedure the Fort Worth, Texas native had undergone.

""Bill's passion for the arts was felt by all who knew him and his warmth and tireless energy were undeniable,"" the representative said in a statement.

Paxton has appeared in more than 90 films and television shows over four decades. From 2006 to 2011, he played the patriarch of a polygamist family in Utah on the HBO series Big Love, winning three Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal. He also acted alongside Tom Cruise in the 2014 film Edge Of Tomorrow. For his role in Apollo 13, Paxton won a Screen Actors Guild Award in 1996 for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture.

The son of a Texas businessman, Paxton had a brush with history on Nov 22, 1963. He was eight and saw then United States president John F. Kennedy speak outside a Fort Worth hotel hours before he was assassinated in Dallas.

A photograph of Paxton held above the crowd to catch a glimpse of the president became famous and, 50 years later, he narrated the documentary JFK: The Final Hours.

187,Aug-20,LOS ANGELES (REUTERS) ,California's heat wave and lightning storms rooted in same weather pattern,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/californias-heat-wave-and-lightning-storms-rooted-in-same-weather-pattern,"LOS ANGELES (REUTERS) - The atmospheric pattern stoking California's record-breaking heatwave this week has also played a role in causing extreme lightning storms that have sparked scores of wildfires, weather and fire officials said on Tuesday (Aug 18).
The surge in lightning strikes - the most widespread burst of such storms in California since 2008 - has come with very little rain, ratcheting up an already volatile wildfire season.
The heat wave was complicating those efforts by adding to the desiccated condition of vegetation fuelling the flames, while posing a greater physical challenge to the firefighters.
""They're wearing a lot of gear, carrying equipment, hiking to remote locations, so it's a stress on the body,"" CalFire's Round said.
Abnormally high temperatures that began roasting California on Friday, straining the state's power grid and leading to rolling blackouts, are due to an enormous dome of high pressure hovering over America's desert Southwest, weather officials said.","rooted, desert, lightning, officials, north, weather, strikes, wildfires, heat, round, californias, storms, pattern, california, wave",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

The surge in lightning strikes - the most widespread burst of such storms in California since 2008 - has come with very little rain, ratcheting up an already volatile wildfire season.
As of Tuesday afternoon, nearly 6,000 lightning strikes were recorded during a single 24-hour stretch, igniting more than 200 wildfires from the San Francisco Bay area north to California's Gold Country, said Ms Lynette Round, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The same high-pressure ridge was siphoning off moisture from remnants of a now-dissipated tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, creating conditions rife for thunderstorms and lightning strikes over central and northern California, meteorologists said.
Rolling blackouts - short-term power cutoffs to prevent a larger collapse of the electrical grid - briefly left over 400,000 homes and businesses without air conditioning over the weekend, the first such blackouts imposed since 2001.","desert, saidthe, blackouts, weather, strikes, wildfires, rolling, heatwave, sparks, storms, california, lightning",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

4 stars

""Now listen to me, wherever you end up, make sure you get married and have children. You hear? Don't let yourself grow into a lonely old woman,"" a mother tells her daughter in one of the stories in Malaysian author Ho Sok Fong's book.

But, as suggested by two of the tales in this piquant collection of short stories about women in Malaysia, marriage and children do not keep loneliness at bay and may even end up crushing one's soul.

In Summer Tornado, Su Qin heeds her mother's advice and moves from Malaysia to Taiwan to marry a man with two children.

But she is painfully conscious of how different she is from her husband and his two kids, especially with her foreign accent.

An outing to an amusement park with her family is used deftly to amplify her unhappiness and sense of alienation.

The gaiety and chatter of the park feel suffocating to the woman, who is on the verge of tears.

Marriage likewise gets a bad rap in the breathtaking opening story, The Wall, about a woman who is habitually ignored by her husband.

Her already stuffy existence becomes even more airless when the authorities build a wall at the back of her house for safety reasons.

With her living space hemmed in by the wall, she finds solace in a stray cat that she takes in. But when it disappears, she starts wasting away.

First published in Chinese in 2014 and translated into English by Natascha Bruce, the book is on the surface quiet and rustic, with stories mostly set in small towns. But Ho tackles themes big and bold",Tales of small-town struggles,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/tales-of-small-town-struggles,"Don't let yourself grow into a lonely old woman,"" a mother tells her daughter in one of the stories in Malaysian author Ho Sok Fong's book.

211,Sep-19,"The latest moves stemmed from a decision by the whistle blower within the intelligence community to file a complaint alleging that Mr Trump had asked for an investigation of the Bidens during a July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Mr Trump, who had put a hold on military aid for Ukraine about a week before the call, allegedly brought up Mr Biden's role in pressing for the firing of a top prosecutor in Ukraine in 2016.

Mr Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been investigated by the prosecutor. Mr Biden's effort to get the prosecutor removed, however, was related to the Obama administration's belief that the prosecutor was ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.

The tentative nature of Mr Biden's remarks underscored the difficulty in predicting how the coming national maelstrom will affect his candidacy.

The moment brings significant opportunities for Mr Biden to showcase that he is Mr Trump's primary foil, and his allies hope it will cause the party to rally behind him even amid a fractious Democratic primary process.

But it also creates the potential for political turmoil, with a daily onslaught of accusations ","In cautious comments, US Democratic presidential hopeful Biden stops short of calling for impeachment now",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/in-cautious-comments-us-democratic-presidential-hopeful-biden-stops-short-of,"Mr Biden previously called on Mr Trump to release a transcript of his conversation with the Ukrainian President, which Mr Trump said he would do on Wednesday.
Mr Biden is mostly alone in the 2020 Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry.
Referencing Mr Trump's targeting of Mr Biden, she added: ""If that's not an impeachable offence, I don't know what is.""
Mr Biden spoke only obliquely on Tuesday about the fact that he was Mr Trump's target, and he never mentioned his son specifically.

ROCK IN 60 MINUTES

Singapore Symphony Orchestra/ Nick Omiccioli and Paul Cesarczyk (electric guitars)/Jacomo Bairos (conductor)

Esplanade Concert Hall/Thursday

If the first of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra's Red Balloon concert series did not quite hit the spot last month, the second on Thursday got a lot closer.

For a start, the orchestra's members dispensed with their ties and jackets and, while they still seemed stiff and rigid, at least there was a hint of informality.

Second, there was former tuba player with the SSO, Jacomo Bairos, who is rapidly earning a reputation as an inspirational and highly communicative conductor.

Among his former colleagues, he seemed not only perfectly at home, but also at times drew from them some truly committed playing.

Third, there was the music. The programme did not so much force the SSO to climb out of its rut, but sent it scurrying off around brightly lit uplands where there was no hiding place for anyone who did not quickly get into the groove.

Nick Omiccioli's was a brilliant piece of orchestral writing, scintillating in its use of heavy metal and rock gestures, and dazzling in the collective virtuosity it called on for the whole orchestra.

A tremendous orchestral showpiece in its own right, inspired by Bairos' direction, for a time, it seemed as if the SSO members were closet rockers.

Sadly, things went downhill after that. Guillaume Connesson's Night",SSO loosens up for a night of rock,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/sso-loosens-up-for-a-night-of-rock,"Second, there was former tuba player with the SSO, Jacomo Bairos, who is rapidly earning a reputation as an inspirational and highly communicative conductor.
A tremendous orchestral showpiece in its own right, inspired by Bairos' direction, for a time, it seemed as if the SSO members were closet rockers.
The music inhabited a world so redolent of Arvo Part's bell-driven, drifting mysticism that it was difficult to comprehend what it was doing in a programme with a rock theme.
With two superb arrangements of numbers from Radiohead and Daft Punk by a former SSO trumpeteer, Sam Hyken, the orchestra finally got back into ""rock mode"".
With some stunning playing from the rhythm section, the SSO positively leapt out of its rut and had a real ball.","symphony, tornado, orchestral, night, loosens, programme, rut, bairos, sso, world, orchestras, rock",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

After that, it will bring powerful winds and heavy rains as it moves into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the hurricane centre said.
The storm comes during the Memorial Day weekend and was expected to scramble transportation on Monday as many people return from holiday travel.
Isolated tornadoes were possible across the central and northern Florida peninsula on Sunday night, according to the hurricane centre, while Alberto was also forecast to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm to low-lying areas that were ""likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"".","winds, florida, lifethreatening, hurricane, centre, alberto, expected, thousands, bring, evacuate, powers, mexico, storm",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

TARGETSThe strikes were aimed at ""chemical weapons infrastructure"" in what the US billed as a warning against Mr Assad employing such weapons in the future - a warning he has not heeded in the past.
They targeted a scientific research facility in the Damascus area, a chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs and a third location that contained both a command post and a chemical weapons equipment storage facility in the same area, the US military said.
AFP's correspondent in Damascus said several consecutive blasts were heard at 4am, followed by the sound of airplanes overhead.

The air strikes by Britain, France and the United States sent a ""clear message"" against the use of chemical weapons, Mrs May said on Saturday.
She said that at an emergency Cabinet meeting in London on Thursday, ""we agreed that it was both right and legal to take military action"" after hearing legal advice.

Four Royal Air Force Tornado jets from the Akrotiri base in Cyprus fired Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility near Homs where it was assessed that Syria had stockpiled chemicals, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.
Mrs May said the strike was ""limited and targeted"" and came after intelligence indicated that Syrian military officials had co-ordinated a chlorine attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7.
Missile attacks by the United States, France and Britain had been aimed at deterring Mr Assad's further use of chemical weapons and were not an attempt to topple the Syrian government, Mrs May said.
Mrs May later told reporters in her Downing Street office that the Western missiles struck a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks.","syrian, military, weapons, syria, cruise, britain, strikes, chemical, deter, struck, missiles, president, attacks, mrs",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

For instance, ""You'll never guess what happened to this Kansas teen after a tornado destroys her home"" is actually a plug for The Wizard Of Oz.
And clicking on the article, ""He befriended a bear when he was a kid and fate reunites them years later,"" leads the reader to The Jungle Book.","litbait, read, wizard, book, tornado, bookstore, social, dallas, readers, lure, classics, media, uses, youll, wildes, wild, literary",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)

Purchases of items intended to boost the attacking capabilities of warplanes, such as precision air-to-ground missiles, advanced guidance systems and air-to-air refuelling gear that extends the duration of flights, are leading an increase in defence outlay, with budgets set to swell by up to 3 per cent annually from 2018, the defence and security specialist said.
Spending across the Middle East and North Africa is rebounding from a decline prompted by the oil price slump as Iran's nuclear deal with the United States paves the way for the removal of most barriers to arms deals involving the Islamic republic from late 2020, according to IHS.
Combined budgets for the area are likely to reach US$180 billion (S$255 billion) a year by that time, with the emphasis on more offensive systems also extending to the naval arena, it said.","states, mideast, weapons, systems, east, offensive, budgets, nations, westernbacked, middle, according, billion, defence, splurge",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (tornado)
