DOCKING TERMINALS DAMAGED

Energy Minister Joram Gumbo said the pipeline bringing fuel from Beira had not been affected by the cyclone but the docking terminals at Beira port had been damaged.

He said Zimbabwe had 62 days supply of petrol and 32 days for diesel, which is in short supply and has led to long queues in the capital. In Mutare city, near Mozambique, diesel shortages were worse, according to a Reuters witness.

""It is the docking terminals at Beira port in Mozambique which were damaged not the pipeline itself,"" Mr Gumbo said told state power company officials.

Around 15,000 people needed rescuing in Mozambique, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said, either by being airlifted out or getting aid dropped to them to survive.

UN humanitarian spokesman Jens Laerke told a regular UN briefing in Geneva the world body was working with planning figures of 600,000 people affected by the cyclone in Mozambique and 840,000 in Malawi.

On Zimbabwe, he had heard from relief agencies an operational figure of 250,000 affected people.

Briefing his team late on Thursday night, Mr Connor Hartnady, rescue operations task force leader for Rescue South Africa, said Beira residents were becoming fed up with shortages.

""There have been three security incidents today, all food related,"" he told his team, without giving further details.

Hartnady also said a group of 60 people had been discovered trapped by flood water in an area north of Beira during a reconnaissance flight. Rescue teams and the government were deciding how best to help them, he said, either by airlifting them to safety or dropping supplies.

RIVER BANKS BURST

Commenting on Beira, Mr Laerke said if people were desperate to get aid, that should be treated as part of the community response and not as a security matter.

""These are desperate people,"" Mr Laerke said. ""I don't think anybody would blame a desperate mother or father who have children who do not have clean water to drink or food to eat who grab it from wherever they find it in a shop.""

The storm's rains caused the Buzi and Pungwe rivers, whose mouths are in the Beira area, to burst their banks.

Roads into Beira were cut off by the storm, and most of the city remains without power. The Red Cross has estimated 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed in the storm.

Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said on Tuesday that 202 people had died, according to the latest toll, and nearly 350,000 people were at risk.

In Zimbabwe, the death toll stood at 100 on Wednesday but was expected to surge to 300, while up to 15,000 people are estimated to have been hit by the storm.

In Malawi, nearly a million people have been affected and more than 80,000 forced from their homes, according to the UN.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya live in the overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar on the southeast coast after fleeing violence in neighbouring Myanmar.

Cyclone Mora battered the area on Tuesday, killing seven people and forcing the evacuation of 600,000 residents. India's navy said it had pulled 33 Bangladeshi survivors and a body from the Bay of Bengal yesterday during search and rescue operations.

Some of the worst damage was at the camps housing the 300,000 Rohingya, whose numbers swelled last year following a military crackdown on the stateless Muslim minority in Myanmar.

Ms Sahany said the storm had destroyed or damaged at least 16,010 homes in the makeshift camps and seriously damaged clinics run by aid agencies for the Rohingya and the local community.

Aid workers scrambled to get food to the camps, which house around 300,000 Rohingya, many of whom were observing the Ramadan fast when the cyclone struck.

""We are also repairing community structures and schools so that families that are sleeping in the open can move inside until their sheds can be repaired,"" said Mr John McKissick, who heads the Cox's Bazar office of the United Nations refugee agency, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The death toll in Mozambique has risen to 217 and around 15,000 people, many of them very ill, still need to be rescued, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said, although rescue workers continue to find bodies and the toll could rise sharply.

Mr Connor Hartnady, leader of a South African rescue operations task force, said a key priority yesterday was to push into remaining areas affected by the flooding that had not yet been explored in search of people needing rescue.

Helicopters were ferrying people, some plucked from the roofs of buildings and treetops, to the port city of Beira, the main headquarters for the huge rescue operation.

One helicopter returned with four children and two women rescued from a small football stadium in an otherwise submerged village.

One young child, with a broken leg, was alone, and hung limp from exhaustion as rescuers laid him on the grass before moving him on to an ambulance.

An elderly woman sat, dazed, nearby with two of her grandchildren. All three were unharmed, but the children had lost their mother.

With floodwaters starting to recede, the priority now is to deliver food and other supplies to people on the ground rather than take people out of the affected areas, although that is also still happening, Mr Correia said.

Some 3,000 people have so far been rescued, he added.

""Our biggest fight is against the clock,"" he told a news conference, adding that the authorities were using all means possible to save lives and were working 24 hours a day.

Cyclone Idai lashed Beira in Mozambique with winds of up to 170kmh a week ago, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions at risk.

The US National Hurricane Centre tweeted that tropical storm Theta had become the 29th event to be named this season, beating the previous record of 28 in 2005 - the year Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
Later on Tuesday, the NHC said there was a 70 per cent chance that the 30th named storm of the season would form within the next five days.
Experts said climate change was helping to increase ocean temperatures, rendering the cyclones more powerful.
Globally, as ocean temperatures increase in step with climate change, there has been a clear pattern of increasing tropical storm intensity in recent decades.","increase, record, season, breaks, climate, hurricane, number, change, tropical, storms, atlantic, named, storm",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

The Rohingya have been systematically stripped of their legal rights in mainly Buddhist Myanmar in recent decades and face rampant discrimination.

Myanmar denies seeking to eradicate the minority but refuses to give UN investigators access to an area where thousands of Rohingya are believed to have been killed.

In November, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement to repatriate some 750,000 Rohingya over two years. Last week Dhaka sent a list of 8,000 names to Myanmar for verification.

NO GOING BACK

But Rohingya leaders bluntly refuse to return. The UN says anyone who goes back must be a volunteer, while Myanmar shows no sign of accepting the Rohingya as full citizens.

""If they send us back, we'll be tortured or killed. We would rather be killed here in Bangladesh. Here, at least I'll get a Muslim burial,"" said Mohammad Elias, whose group has staged protests against repatriation in recent weeks.

According to the UN, since the repatriation deal was signed on Nov 23, nearly 70,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh through different routes in and near Cox's Bazar district.

""Those who came in recent days said they were tortured,"" Mainuddin Khan, Teknaf town police chief, told AFP.

Some Rohingya who remained in Rakhine's three main Muslim districts said the situation has improved in parts of the region, but life in the empty villages was unbearable.

Lead author Terry Hughes, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said the frequency, intensity and scale of climate-fuelled marine heatwaves that cause coral bleaching are increasing.
Bleaching occurs when healthy corals become stressed by spikes in ocean temperatures, causing them to expel algae living in their tissues which drains them of their vibrant colours.
The Great Barrier Reef has suffered three mass bleaching events during heatwaves in 2016, 2017 and 2020, leaving many affected corals struggling to survive.
The reef is also susceptible to harm from cyclones and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat the coral, with both factors becoming more damaging due to climate change.","shows, impacts, study, great, 98, coral, corals, reef, bleaching, mass, cent, barrier, heatwaves, climate, reefs",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

The effects of climate change on tropical storms including hurricanes are still being studied, although the warming planet is already known to be making storms bigger and stronger.
The researchers looked to see whether the longer rate of decay correlated with sea temperatures, which vary year to year, though they are rising overall.
They found a clear link: when sea surface temperature was higher, storms stayed stronger on land for longer.

One of the study's most alarming conclusions is that hikes in sea level caused by a disintegrating Antarctic ice sheet - which holds enough frozen water to boost oceans 58 metres - would become dramatically larger with each additional degree of warming.
Sea level rise, for example, would average about 1.3 metres for each of the first two degrees above pre-industrial levels.
But from 2 deg C to 6 deg C above that benchmark, the increase in sea level would double to 2.4 metres per degree of warming.
Beyond that, each added degree would result in 10 more metres, pushing the entire ice sheet past the point of no return and lifting oceans to levels not seen for millions of years.","shows, sea, seas, oceans, study, temperature, antarctica, lift, degree, level, metres, sheet, average, ice, climate, warming",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

The coronavirus crisis may have shunted climate into the sidelines as nations launched unprecedented shutdowns to try to slow its spread, but Mr Guterres said the need for climate action was more urgent than ever.
""They need to act together in relation to the climate threat that is a much bigger threat than the threat of the pandemic in itself - it's an existential threat for our planet and for our lives.""

With the world's population forecast to rise to nearly 10 billion by 2050, intensifying the scramble for resources and fuelling conflict, the research shows as many as 1.2 billion people living in vulnerable areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East may be forced to migrate by 2050.
By comparison, ecological factors and conflict led to the displacement of some 30 million people in 2019, the report said.
The result is an analysis assessing how many threats each of some 150 countries faces and their capacity to withstand them.

The surge in lightning strikes - the most widespread burst of such storms in California since 2008 - has come with very little rain, ratcheting up an already volatile wildfire season.
The heat wave was complicating those efforts by adding to the desiccated condition of vegetation fuelling the flames, while posing a greater physical challenge to the firefighters.

The same high-pressure ridge was siphoning off moisture from remnants of a now-dissipated tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, creating conditions rife for thunderstorms and lightning strikes over central and northern California, meteorologists said.

The sweltering heat is only going to get more unbearable.

On average, it is almost 1 deg C hotter in Singapore today as compared to the 1950s.

Did you know that by 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that global temperatures are likely to exceed 1.5 deg C? It warns that global warming must be limited to 1.5 deg C or less to minimise its impact.

Land retaken by the sea

Each year, sea levels rise by up to 5 millimetres, with greater increases near the equator. By 2100, the seas surrounding Singapore could rise by up to 1 metre.

With a third of the country less than 5 metres above sea level, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong estimated that at least S$100 billion will be needed over the next century to guard against rising seas.

Weather Extremities

Global warming gives rise to more frequent and intense storms, droughts, floods and cyclones. These are a threat to human lives and food security.

Major airports in storm-vulnerable regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and India have been effectively turned into giant parking spaces as Covid-19 travel restrictions choke demand.
Airline insurers, already on the hook to refund large portions of crash risk premiums because of the groundings, now face the larger-than-usual risk posed by having lots of airplanes grouped together at airports, industry experts said.
Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport has so many aircraft on the ground that it is using a runway for parking, according to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.

In Malaysia, fishermen and vegetable farmers have had to dump their produce because they have not been able to get it to their customers, citing road blocks and a lack of manpower. Fortunately, some suppliers have linked up directly with online delivery services to get the produce to buyers.

So far, global food supplies and delivery are functioning. But concerns remain and the longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the fears of disruption.

The world's food system is already highly leveraged because of globalisation, with many nations reliant on imports and efficient transport and storage. The system is vulnerable to sudden shocks, which has led to unrest in the recent past.

In 2010, a combination of droughts and severe floods in key grain growing countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Russia, caused food shortages and price spikes that fuelled political unrest in the Middle East, triggering the Arab Spring.

The UN Food and Agricultural Organization's food price index for December 2010 hit an all",The twin threats to food security: Pandemics and climate disruptions,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-twin-threats-to-food-security-pandemics-and-climate-disruptions,"In a world of 7.8 billion hungry people, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered global fears about food supplies.

Dense clouds of the ravenous insects have spread from Ethiopia and Somalia into Kenya, in the region's worse infestation in decades.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated the size of one swarm in Kenya at 2,400 sq km, meaning it could contain up to 200 billion locusts, each of which is able to consume its own weight in food every day.

The locust invasion is the biggest in Ethiopia and Somalia in 25 years, and the biggest in Kenya in 70 years, according to the FAO.

The agreement enters a crucial implementation phase in 2020, when countries are supposed to ratchet up their ambitions ahead of the next major round of talks in Glasgow.
If big economies such as China, India, Japan, Brazil, Australia and others fail to agree on more meaningful climate action soon, then scientists say already slim hopes of averting catastrophic temperature rises will all but vanish.","paris, erupts, madrid, states, summit, talks, economies, anger, resist, nations, major, action, emissions, bold, scientists, climate",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sounded the clarion call for the country to tackle climate change in his National Day Rally speech in August, calling it an existential threat for Singapore. His announcement appears to have propelled climate change into the national consciousness.

In a Straits Times online poll of 1,000 respondents, 40 per cent said they were more concerned about the issue after listening to his speech.

A month later, about 2,000 Singaporeans and permanent residents attended a rally at Hong Lim Park to call for more action on climate change.

The growing interest in climate change here comes at a time when the issue is also gaining significant traction globally.

Some may question the necessity of climate action, saying human ingenuity could solve the challenge of climate change just as it had numerous other obstacles before.

For many, this means increased ambition and action to enable countries to de-carbonise their economies by the middle of the century.
Equally ambitious plans are also needed to build the resilience of vulnerable sectors and communities being battered by climate related disasters of increasing frequency, intensity and unpredictability.
Nowhere is this reality starker than in the Asia-Pacific region which has suffered another punishing year of devastation due to extreme events linked to climate change.

Global warming has led to widespread shrinking of ice sheets and glaciers, reductions in snow cover and Arctic sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperature.
- The loss of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic could affect the planet's albedo, or reflectivity.
But with warming causing earth's icy ""shield"" to melt, this could result in an increase in the amount of heat absorbed by the planet, exacerbating the warming trend.
If permafrost melts and releases this stored carbon into the atmosphere, it will reinforce the warming trend.","water, sea, panels, planet, report, state, arctic, findings, special, carbon, change, trend, permafrost, key, ice, climate, turn, warming",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

The worst drought in living memory has already cut total gross domestic product by 0.15 per cent, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) deputy governor Guy Debelle said in a speech in Sydney.

While the impact of climate change is usually most severe on agriculture, global warming presents significant risks and opportunities for a broader part of the A$1.9 trillion (S$1.8 trillion) economy, he said.

In his speech, titled Climate Change And The Economy, Mr Debelle said monetary policy was always focused on analysing and assessing a large number of forces.

""But few of these forces have the scale, persistence and systemic risk of climate change,"" he said.

""What if droughts are more frequent, or cyclones happen more often? The supply shock is no longer temporary but close to permanent,"" he added.

Australia had its third warmest year on record last year, marked by drought and a prolonged bush fire season, with maximum temperatures about 1.55 deg C above average across the country.

The tax would lay the cost of rising disaster losses directly on the industries most responsible for them, they said in a report released at UN climate negotiations in Poland.
Besides assisting those in need overseas, a large share of income from the government-levied tax could help poorer groups at home take up green jobs, energy and transport, backers said.
Spending on social justice measures is seen as crucial to avoiding the kind of protests France has seen in recent weeks over rising living costs, sparked partly by hikes in fuel taxes.

Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed the border from Myanmar's Rakhine state since August, and are in cramped camps at Cox's Bazar.
The latest wave of refugees joined about 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most crowded countries, who fled previous bouts of violence.
Mr Alam pointed to blueprints of construction on the island 30km from the mainland, and said one plan could be to bring potential donors there.
Bangladesh sees the island as a temporary arrangement for refugees, but has given conflicting signals on how much freedom they would have to leave once there.","donors, state, bangladesh, million, foreign, refugees, alam, international, refugee, minister, rohingya, help, expecting, island, countries",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

LEGENDS OF THE CONDOR HEROES VOL. 1: A HERO BORN

By Jin Yong, translated by Anna Holmwood

MacLehose Press/Paperback/ 372 pages/$29.95/Major bookstores

3.5 stars

There are a lot of ways in which this ambitious translation of Chinese writer Jin Yong's beloved martial arts epic resembles its hero Guo Jing.

It gets off to a slow start. It is bumbling and can exasperate. But it is also earnest and brave, and one glimpses in it the potential to unlock something extraordinary.

Translator Anna Holmwood has taken on a ridiculously daunting task with Jin Yong's most famous work, a sprawling narrative set in the war",Complex gongfu scenes come alive,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/complex-gongfu-scenes-come-alive,"In return, he names their unborn sons Guo Jing and Yang Kang and vows to return to the village one day to teach them gongfu.
Stricken by guilt, Qiu makes a wager with the Seven Freaks of the South, a motley crew of fighters he has tangled with.
He will find Yang, they Guo; each will raise the boy in their charge to adulthood and teach them gongfu.
While the translated text does not always flow well, it is oddly in the most complex fight scenes that Holmwood's rendition excels.
Such moments are like a camera lens suddenly bringing into focus the heroic grandeur that so endeared Jin Yong's tales to generations.","complex, qiu, yang, scenes, jin, gongfu, translated, come, teach, yongs, chinese, makes, alive, guo, song",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

Music was the centre of his life, and the idea of Siva Choy going out without any music was not right.""
Choy, who learnt to play the guitar as a child, first performed as a teenager with his younger brother James in the 1960s under the band name The Cyclones.
Choy is, however, more widely known in Singapore for penning the rap song Why U So Like Dat?, which was featured on the album of the same name written with the now-defunct comedy group Kopi Kat Klan.","band, sharp, nowdefunct, classic, singapore, singlish, penned, music, choy, ms, dat, musician, siva, dies, penning, rap, veteran, died",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

Beyond music, he showcased his comedic skills on stage in shows such as Rocking Rambutan! (1999), part of Action Theatre's Stand Up For Singapore! comedy series, and Stand Up And Boogie (2000).

He had a supporting role in the movie One Leg Kicking (2001), in which he played former football star Sammy Best, as well.

Choy was also the author of the popular Kitchi Boy stories, about a group of local boys and which were filled with Singlish and colloquial humour.

They were eventually compiled and published in 1985 as a book, Oh No, It's The Kitchi Boy Gang. A year later, he followed up with another book titled I'm Sorry, It's Kitchi Boy Again.

Music expert and researcher Joseph Pereira, whose book Legends Of The Golden Venus (1999) features a chapter on Choy, told ST that the comedian's ""very local sense of humour"" spoke to Singaporeans.

He said: ""Siva tapped into the idiosyncrasies of Singaporean culture and language, and it worked. From Kitchi Boy to Why U So Like Dat?, many Singaporeans found things they could identify with. Also, Siva was just hilarious.""

Veteran musician Jerry Fernandez, 69, who had known Choy ""since way back"" in their school days at student music competitions, remembers him as a ""brilliant"" man.

It is therefore disappointing to read that in a survey carried out by Blackbox recently, the Singapore public ranks last in its favourable attitude towards Asean.

Only 77 per cent of the Singaporeans surveyed had a favourable or very favourable view of Asean, compared with 85 per cent for all Asean countries.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS

Asean brings enormous benefits to Singapore and Singaporeans.

The best way to demonstrate this is to remind Singaporeans that our domestic market consists of 5.6 million consumers. Under the Asean Economic Community, the ambition is to integrate the 10 economies into a single market and production base. This means that our domestic market is not 5.6 million but 628 million consumers.

770,17-Dec,"Lower volcanic activity at Bali's Mount Agung and favourable wind conditions for the third day running allowed the airport on the neighbouring resort island of Lombok to continue operating for most of yesterday.

The airport, located just west of Bali, reopened yesterday morning after being closed on Thursday due to ash clouds from the volcano, which has been erupting intermittently since Nov 21.

Indonesia's airport operator, Angkasa Pura, said flights resumed because winds had blown the volcanic ash away from Lombok.

Favourable winds had also led the authorities to allow for the resumption of flights into Bali.

Reuters yesterday quoted meteorological officials as saying that a tropical cyclone south of Java had altered the wind direction in the area, but warned of heavy rain and strong winds until today. At least 27 people have been killed and thousands displaced by the heavy rain so far.

Many carriers, including Singapore Airlines, have resumed flights to and from Bali, but Reuters reported that budget airline Jetstar would cancel nine of 15 planned flights over fears that ash could hit the airport in the evening.

Reuters also said Malaysia's AirAsia would operate out of Bali only during the day.

Airlines avoid flying through volcanic ash clouds because they could damage aircraft engines, hamper pilot visibility and, in extreme circumstances, even cause engine failure.

Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), which maintains a separate alert status from the aviation authorities, has kept the highest alert level for Bali and has not lifted the 10km radius exclusion zone around Mount Agung.

Bali, which usually sees an influx of tourists during this time of the year, also remains in a state of emergency until Dec 10.

Data from the Volcanology and Disaster Mitigation Centre (PVMBG) yesterday showed no incandescent lava or major tremors at Mount Agung, but eruptions accompanied by heavy plumes of ash clouds were still detected.

PVMBG chief I Gede Suantika said the volcano remained in a ""critical phase"" with the potential for a major eruption.

""Although (volcanic activity at Mount Agung) is on a relative decline, we cannot determine that (it) has completely subsided,"" he said.

Bali is bracing itself for a major eruption, with BNPB spokesman Sutopo Nugroho disclosing that more than 55,700 villagers have been evacuated from the danger zone.

More than 1,500 people were killed when Mount Agung last had a major eruption in 1963.

Volcanologists say it is difficult to predict when the next large eruption will occur, pointing to Sumatra's Mount Sinabung, which is still at the highest alert level after roaring back to life four years ago.

This combination of Hurricane and floods was what made the event so devastating and is mostly due to the higher temperature of the sea in the Gulf of Mexico at that time, which can reasonably be attributed to human induced climate change.
Hence, we can also reasonably attribute the severity of the recent floods in South Asia to human induced climate change.
An interesting contrast between the US and the countries of South Asia is the acceptance of the science of climate change and the willingness to take adaptation actions to tackle the problem-President Trump and his cabinet colleagues all deny the very science of climate change and are thus endangering the safety of their own citizens.

HONEST CONVERSATIONS

SG Narratives, a recently created YouTube channel, has been making waves for exploring the dynamics between people in modern relationships.

In the videos, two people sit opposite each other and answer a set of given questions designed to encourage an honest exchange.

This enables them to ""listen to each other, no matter how difficult"".

Officials said firefighters were able to carve containment lines around 22 per cent of the blaze as of Thursday night - up from just four per cent earlier in the day - despite dry, hot and windy weather conditions and treacherous terrain.
But the intensely burning blaze, producing cyclone-like whirls of flame, continued to threaten some 34,500 homes and other structures in communities including the ski resort town of Wrightwood, fire officials said.
While many residents opted to stay put for the time being, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office said deputies arrested three people suspected of attempting to loot from the abandoned homes of evacuees.
Transit authorities on Thursday reopened Interstate 15, the primary traffic route between greater Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada, after it was closed for two days by the fast-moving blaze.","wildfire, gain, pass, ground, homes, residents, weather, firefighters, hot, cent, los, cut, california",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

Pacific island nations are among the world's most physically and economically vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events such as floods, earthquakes and tropical cyclones, the World Bank said in a 2013 report.

While world powers have summit meetings to negotiate treaties on how to reduce and mitigate carbon emissions, residents of tiny Kiribati, a former British colony with 110,000 people, are debating how to respond before it is too late.

Much of Kiribati, a collection of 33 coral atolls and reef islands scattered across a swathe of the Pacific Ocean about twice the size of Alaska, lies no higher than 1.8m above sea level. The latest climate models predict the world's oceans could rise by 1.5m to 1.8m by 2100.

The prospects of rising seas and intensifying storms ""threaten the very existence and livelihoods of large segments of the population"", the government told the United Nations in a report last year.

And many Kiribati residents remain sceptical of the need to prepare for an eventuality that may be decades away.
But a 2011 government-commissioned report cast doubt on whether the World Bank project helped Kiribati prepare for climate change.
""The science of climate change is not 100 per cent precise,"" he said in the interview.

The recent wild weather across Australia's east coast and Tasmania is likely to bring a wave of insurance claims.
While the rains have eased, emergency workers said the threat to the state continues as floodwaters move downstream.
Floodwaters around Launceston - one of Australia's oldest cities - are expected to peak on Wednesday, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said.
As floods threaten, nearly 3,000 residents in the low-lying Launceston suburb of Invermay have been evacuated.","rains, state, city, meteorology, weather, tasmania, workers, threaten, floods, australian, australias, recent, oldest, set, historic, peak",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)
884,16-Jun,WELLINGTON (AFP) ,New Zealand PM John Key to visit Fiji as coup legacy lingers,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/new-zealand-pm-john-key-to-visit-fiji-as-coup-legacy-lingers,"WELLINGTON (AFP) - Prime Minister John Key will this week become the first New Zealand leader to visit Fiji in a decade, saying the military coup that soured Wellington-Suva relations for years is ""ancient history"".
New Zealand strongly denounced Fiji when Bainimarama seized power in 2006 and ruled by decree until the September 2014 election.
Key said the time was right to visit Fiji after New Zealand played a major part in helping the country recover from super cyclone Winston, which killed 44 people in February.
Even the travelling New Zealand media pack accompanying Key has been affected by the coup's legacy, with respected TVNZ reporter Barbara Dreaver unable to make the trip.
She has been unable to visit Fiji since.","unable, lingers, coup, rights, john, visit, dreaver, fiji, tvnz, key, told, legacy, zealand, saying",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

Tens of thousands of people were marooned on higher ground as flood waters submerged areas around Cox's Bazar and the hilly district of Bandarban.
Local police official Habibur Rahman confirmed the toll to reporters after four more bodies were recovered from a river on Sunday.
Bangladesh - one of the world's most densely populated countries - is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including cyclones, droughts, floods and earthquakes.
India, Bangladesh and China are most at risk from river floods, with an increasing number of people threatened because of climate change and economic growth in low-lying regions, a study said in March.","worlds, waters, threatened, bangladesh, southeastern, landslides, kill, floods, river, toll, vulnerable, thousands, 23, flash, triggered",Severe weather disruptions,Acute climatological event (cyclone)

But it clawed back some popularity through its relief efforts after a catastrophic 2011 flood.
A Supreme Court decision in February rejected the possibility of amnesty for perpetrators of serious human rights abuses that were committed during the conflict between Maoist rebels and the security forces.
But he added, ""The most important thing is the relief effort, whatever you may think (the army) has done.""
