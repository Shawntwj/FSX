The resort town of Murree, around 70km north-east of Islamabad, was inundated with tourists and daytrippers last week after unusually heavy snow turned it into a winter wonderland.
But a blizzard from last Friday (Jan 7) onwards felled trees and blocked narrow roads leading in and out of the town, which clings to steep hills and valleys at an altitude of 2,300m.
Officials said nearly 100,000 visitors in thousands of vehicles had thronged the town by last Friday, causing an enormous traffic jam even before the blizzard.
Several Pakistan newspapers, however, excoriated administrators on Sunday, noting the country's weather bureau warned as early as last Thursday of the approaching blizzard.","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.012, 'compound': -0.7906}",negative,-0.7906

The Taliban stopped issuing passports shortly after their Aug 15 return to power, as tens of thousands of people scrambled to Kabul's only airport in a bid to catch any international flight that could evacuate them.
Issuing passports is seen as a test of the Taliban's commitment to the international community to allow eligible people to leave amid the growing humanitarian crisis.","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.1027}",positive,0.1027

104,Oct-21,Pope expresses 'shame' at French sex abuse scandal,"VATICAN CITY (AFP) - Pope Francis on Wednesday (Oct 6) expressed his personal shame and that of the Roman Catholic Church at the sexual abuse of children by French Catholic clergy, after the scale of the problem was laid bare in a devastating report.
""And also my shame, our shame, my shame for the inability of the Church for too long to put them at the centre of its concerns.
An independent commission on Tuesday revealed that French Catholic clergy sexually abused around 216,000 minors over seven decades since 1950, a ""massive phenomenon"" that was covered up by a ""veil of silence"".
The commission's two-and-a-half-year inquiry and 2,500-page report prompted outrage as the Catholic Church in France and around the world faces a growing number of abuse claims and prosecutions.
Dealing with the avalanche of revelations about sexual abuse by clergy was one of the biggest challenges that the Pope faced when he was elected in 2013.","{'neg': 0.226, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.024, 'compound': -0.9906}",negative,-0.9906

After heavy snowfall and deadly blizzards lashed Europe, conditions marginally improved in some regions - although temperatures generally remained sub-zero, forcing more major delays on roads, railways and at some airports.
Flood warnings were issued yesterday due to the melting snow, which in Scotland had led to snow drifts up to 3m deep, according to ScotRail.
In France, the forecast this weekend was for rain rather than the kind of heavy snowfall that has blanketed vast tracts of Europe.
The freezing Siberian winds combined with another storm called Emma, which swept up from the south to hit Britain, dumping more snow.","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.028, 'compound': -0.8748}",negative,-0.8748

Mount Agung, Bali's highest peak, rumbled back to life in September, forcing the evacuation of 140,000 people living nearby.
Some experts warn that Mount Agung might at last be delivering the large full-blown eruption that has been feared for several weeks.
They say volcanic eruptions are difficult to predict and it is very hard to tell exactly how the situation would develop.

Mount Agung has been actively erupting for a week, but it started to rumble back in September, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes.
The vast majority of those deaths were caused by the eruption's pyroclastic flow - a high-speed wall of ash, debris and hot gas that surged down the mountainside.

Cosby has become a pariah since an avalanche of women accused him of feeding them pills and having sex with them.
In the Constand case, Cosby has admitted giving her a pill but accuses her of lying about the assault.

The Taleban, who are in the middle of their annual summer offensive and are more powerful than ISIS, strongly denied any involvement in Saturday's attack.
The National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan's main intelligence agency, said the attack was masterminded by Abu Ali, an ISIS commander in Nangarhar's volatile Achin district.
The bombings, which killed at least 80 people and wounded 231, mark the deadliest single attack in Kabul since the Taleban were toppled from power in a 2001 US-led invasion, the UN said.
