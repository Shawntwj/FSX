MOSCOW â€¢ Russia said its scientists had detected the world's first case of transmission of the H5N8 strain of avian flu from birds to humans and had alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO).
"Information about the world's first case of transmission of the avian flu (H5N8) to humans has already been sent to the World Health Organisation," she said.
While the highly contagious strain H5N8 is lethal for birds, it had never before been reported to have spread to humans.
Ms Popova praised "the important scientific discovery", saying "time will tell" if the virus can further mutate.
Avian flu has raged in several European nations including France, where hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled to stop the infection.
