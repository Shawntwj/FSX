0,Jan-22,SINGAPORE ,"Dengue-infected mosquitoes take more bites, increasing transmission chances: Study",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/dengue-infected-mosquitoes-take-more-bites-increasing-transmission-chances-study,"SINGAPORE - A dengue-infected mosquito bites more times to successfully draw blood, which triples the opportunity for the virus to be transmitted, a study has found.
They noted that the dengue virus also leads to mosquitoes becoming more attracted to humans.
Dengue-infected mosquitoes will fly faster to the host and more mosquitoes will land on the skin.
This increases the chance for dengue-infected mosquitoes to bite, said Associate Professor Ashley St. John, from Duke-NUS' Emerging Infectious Diseases programme.
With the dengue virus affecting more than 400 million people each year, killing around 40,000 of them, scientists have been working towards more effective disease control strategies.","bites, increasing, blood, dengue, mosquitoes, transmitted, virus, dengueinfected, transmission, mosquito, study, understand, chances, bite",Human health crises,pandemic

This is because the previously uncommon dengue virus serotype 3 (DenV-3) - which people here have less immunity against - has been circulating, said NEA.
There were 147 dengue cases reported between Jan 9 and 15, and 105 the week before that.
The NEA said it expects dengue case numbers this year to exceed last year's 5,258 reported cases.
Cross-protective immunity to dengue virus serotypes is the protection against one dengue virus serotype due to pre-existing immunity developed from past exposure to a different serotype.","rose, dengue, coming, population, virus, surge, nea, week, singapore, reported, denv3, immunity, warns, cases, 183, serotype, outbreak, months",Human health crises,pandemic
2,Jan-22,SINGAPORE ,SingHealth researchers conducting trials on drug to treat dengue,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singhealth-researchers-conducting-trials-on-drug-to-treat-dengue,"SINGAPORE - Researchers here are conducting clinical trials on a first-of-its-kind drug which, if successful, could treat dengue.
Professor Jenny Low, deputy clinical and scientific director at SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU), which is running the trials, told The Straits Times that there is currently no drug to treat dengue specifically.
Instead, treatment focuses on supporting patients and treating the symptoms of dengue, such as fever and pain.
The new experimental drug works by preventing two proteins from the dengue virus - known as NS3 and NS4B - from interacting.
In rare cases, dengue may progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can lead to death.","symptoms, dengue, conducting, singhealth, virus, drug, works, low, given, trials, treatment, researchers, treat, fever",Human health crises,pandemic

More than 4,500 dengue cases have been reported this year and there are currently 12 active clusters in Singapore.
It noted the population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito - which spreads the dengue virus - increased by about 22 per cent in September this year, compared with August.
The mosquito population is high in some areas, including Geylang Bahru, Jalan Berseh, Kelantan Lane, Kelantan Road, Jelapang Road and Woodlands Street 81.

There is no doubt about the threat posed by the mosquito-borne dengue virus, which is estimated to infect at least 98 million people a year and is endemic in 128 countries worldwide.
It can cause intense flu-like symptoms, and sometimes develops into severe dengue which can be fatal.
And because there are four different strains of the virus, infection with one doesn't protect against another, and catching dengue a second time is often more serious.
No treatment exists so far, with efforts focusing instead on reducing transmission - including a programme that infects mosquitoes with a disease-resistant bacteria.","amazing, symptoms, effective, dengue, virus, countries, ride, study, university, infection, treatment, research, hope, offers, neyts",Human health crises,pandemic

Dengue cases, caused by the dengue virus, are being reported at an alarming rate from numerous countries in Latin America and Asia, including Singapore.
The current dengue epidemic is explained by the shift in the most prevalent type of dengue (from type 2 to type 3) in a population with historically low immunity to type 3.
To make matters worse, many of the early disease features, such as muscle and body aches, fever, fatigue and headache, overlap between Covid-19 and dengue.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) is working closely with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to put in place preventive measures against dengue, which include community outreach and public education, vector control efforts, as well as ongoing surveillance of reported dengue cases.

Primary care providers play a crucial role in the management of dengue patients. Today, more than 80 per cent of dengue cases are safely managed in an outpatient setting by primary care doctors. The timely diagnosis and management of stable dengue patients in the community ensure that hospital resources are reserved for more severe cases who require inpatient management.

In addition, primary care providers also help with gathering ground surveillance on the dengue situation.

To better support primary care providers, MOH provides regular clinical guidance on managing dengue patients within the community.

To fight against dengue, it is important to disrupt the chain of transmission through vector control and eradication of mosquito breeding spots.

MOH and NEA have also worked together to put in place preventive measures, such as providing insect repellent to private primary care clinics and polyclinics for distribution to patients suspected to have dengue infections, in order to prevent further onward transmission.

Think of permafrost, a climate change time bomb spread across Russia, Canada and Alaska that contains three times the carbon that has been emitted since the start of industrialisation.
Even if humanity manages to cap global warming at under 2 deg C, the cornerstone goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the permafrost area will decrease by a quarter by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations' climate science panel.

As part of Project Wolbachia, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release specially bred mosquitoes across all 1,455 HDB blocks in these two towns, which roughly account for 15 per cent of all HDB blocks in Singapore.

The project expansion across all of Yishun and Tampines is slated to be completed by March 2022.

These specially bred, male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the Wolbachia bacterium. After mating with their female counterparts, the resulting eggs do not hatch, thus suppressing their population.

Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were first introduced at test sites in Yishun and Tampines in 2016, and NEA found that it led to a marked fall in the mosquito population.
The fall in the mosquito population translates to a reduced incidence of dengue, according to Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching, director of NEA's Environmental Health Institute.

Until and unless the problem of stagnant water in public drains is addressed, dengue will continue to be a serious health issue in Singapore.

Dengue fever cases are on the increase despite the efforts of the National Environment Agency (NEA) to release more male mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacteria that make them sterile.

With many condominiums and companies doing fogging on different days and at different times, these male mosquitoes are being killed. This negates the aim of getting the males to mate with females that consequently lay eggs that will not hatch.

A Although the above efforts have been effective in moderating the magnitude of dengue outbreaks, dengue control will continue to be dependent on the efforts of the whole community.

Singapore is in the midst of a dengue outbreak, with five reported deaths from the disease so far this year.
Associate Professor Ng Lee Ching, director of National Environment Agency's (NEA) Environmental Health Institute, said Singapore has low herd immunity against the disease as good mosquito control over the years means many people have never been infected.

The female Aedes mosquitoes, which spread the dengue virus, need to drink blood to reproduce.
The agency is also looking to scale up its Wolbachia programme to suppress the number of Aedes mosquitoes by releasing sterile male mosquitoes in dengue hot spots.
NEA has built a new facility capable of producing five million sterile male mosquitoes a week - or 10 times its previous capacity.
About six male mosquitoes for every person need to be released for the programme to be effective, with regular releases at each site.","200, number, cases, dengue, mosquitoes, day, sites, nea, female, male, aedes, infections, peak",Human health crises,pandemic

The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, found a likelihood for significant expansion of dengue in the south",Climate change could boost spread of dengue: Study,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/climate-change-could-boost-spread-of-dengue-study,"NEW YORK • Climate change is poised to increase the spread of dengue fever, which is common in parts of the world with warmer climates like Brazil and India, a new study warns.
Worldwide each year, there are 100 million cases of dengue infections that are severe enough to cause symptoms, which may include fever, debilitating joint pain and internal bleeding.
There are an estimated 10,000 deaths from dengue, which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that also spread Zika and chikungunya.
Globally, the study estimated that more than two billion additional people could be at risk for dengue in 2080 compared with in 2015 under a warming scenario roughly representative of the world's current emissions trajectory.
That increase largely comes from population growth in areas already at high risk for the disease, as well as the expansion of dengue's range.","estimated, boost, dengue, fever, spread, change, risk, areas, study, zika, expansion, increase, climate",Human health crises,pandemic

The NEA said that its Gravitrap surveillance system had detected about 40 per cent more Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in December last year, compared with December 2017.

Gravitraps are traps that catch such mosquitoes and collect data on them.

Two were local Zika virus infections, while the other two were imported cases.

All four people sought outpatient treatment and have since recovered.

The ministry said that sporadic cases of Zika will be detected from time to time, as Singapore is a travel hub and remains vulnerable to the importation of the Zika disease.

The NEA has been taking steps to fight dengue, Mr Masagos said.

From January to February, it conducted 161,000 inspections in public areas and housing estates and discovered about 3,200 mosquito breeding habitats, most of which were in people's homes.

At the start of the year, the environment agency also laid 14,000 Gravitraps in newly completed Housing Board blocks and landed housing estates. More than 64,000 of these devices islandwide trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes that are looking for places to lay their eggs, and also stop young mosquitoes in these traps from emerging.

216,Mar-20,"We thank Mr Teo Yew Cheng for his feedback (Fight against coronavirus laudable, but what about dengue effort?, Feb 24).

Dengue is endemic in Singapore and the region.

Keeping the Aedes aegypti mosquito population low is the most effective dengue control measure. Singapore's vector control programme, aligned with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Integrated Vector Management strategy, is globally recognised and has significantly reduced dengue transmission over the years.

Our epidemiological investigations and vector control operations have been commended by the WHO as a role model for countries.

Our vector control efforts have led to good outcomes. A joint study with the National University of Singapore showed that Singapore residents are six times less likely to get a first dengue infection today than in the 1970s. While 70 per cent of Singapore youth in the early 1980s had exposure to dengue, only 16 per cent did in 2009. In contrast, 50 per cent to 80 per cent of young people in other endemic countries carry dengue antibodies.

However, this success also means lower population immunity, leaving us susceptible to outbreaks despite having the same number of or fewer mosquitoes.

About 75 per cent of infected people do not show symptoms, enabling virus spread. Climate change and Singapore's status as a global hub also mean we have less control, such as from importation of cases. There is no room for complacency, especially with the recent increase in cases due to dengue virus serotype 3, to which our population has low immunity.

The National Environment Agency continues to work at improving our dengue control system.

In January, we completed the deployment of Gravitrap sensors to private landed estates, complementing those deployed at Housing Board estates since 2017.

These 64,000 Gravitraps help us enhance mosquito monitoring, alert stakeholders and mobilise vector control resources more effectively.

237,Dec-18,"The NEA said the process of exterminating mosquitoes has been taking place since Oct 13, when the Bedok area was designated a cluster. Inspections by NEA officers will continue.

The agency also said insecticide will be sprayed periodically in common areas such as void decks to kill adult mosquitoes.

The NEA advises residents to use insect repellent to avoid being bitten and to check their homes daily for potential breeding sites.

Besides putting up alert banners and posters in the area, the NEA is also working with the community to conduct house visits to raise awareness, with pamphlets and insect repellent distributed during the visits.

""As adult mosquitoes could be resting in indoor spaces, we also request residents to allow NEA officers to carry out spraying of their homes,"" said the NEA spokesman.

Ms Serena Tan, 39, a housewife living in one of the blocks in Jalan Damai, said she changes the trays used for her indoor house plants every day as she does not want her children to get infected.

""Since some leaflets have been distributed during the house visits, we have been very conscientious in making sure there is no stagnant water lying around at home,"" she said.

Another resident, Ms Andrea Tan, 29, who works in sales, said she was anxious about the area around her flat being part of a dengue hot spot.

""Dengue can be a deadly disease, and I hope the NEA can use all methods possible to get the mosquitoes out of the area,"" Ms Tan said.

""There are primary and secondary schools just a stone's throw from mosquito breeding grounds, and this is not safe for the kids."" She was referring to Bedok North Secondary and Telok Kurau Primary, both located within 500m of the blocks with reported dengue cases.

Symptoms of dengue, which is transmitted through bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, include the sudden onset of fever for two to seven days, severe headaches with pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, bleeding from the nose or gums, and easy bruising.

250,Aug-19,"We thank Mr Kevin Ho Kun Kok for his feedback (Pull out all the stops to fight mosquito breeding, Aug 8).

This year's surge in dengue cases can be attributed to an increase in mosquito population, warmer weather and lowered herd immunity in our population.

The primary carrier of dengue, the Aedes aegypti, thrives in urban settings, breeds in artificial containers and dwells mainly indoors. Keeping premises clean and maintaining them well is an important aspect of mosquito control.

Public areas are cleaned regularly and this is stepped up where there are fallen leaves that can collect water or accumulate in drains and impede water flow.

Residents should alert the National Environment Agency (NEA) or town councils to any choked drains or other areas of concern with cleanliness that could pose a public health risk.
