GLASGOW (BLOOMBERG) - One billion people will be at risk of extreme heat stress if global warming causes the world's temperature to rise by 2 deg Celsius, new modeling shows.
A study by the Met Office, the United Kingdom's's national meteorological service, warned that a 2 deg C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet.
A 4 deg C rise would mean that nearly half of the world's population could be living in affected areas, according to the research, released at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The Met Office used an indicator which combines warmth and humidity, known as wet-bulb temperature, to assess heat stress risk.
Limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C is a key goal of this year's climate talks, where "keeping 1.5 alive" has become an unofficial motto.
