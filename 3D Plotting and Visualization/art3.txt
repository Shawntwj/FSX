Ukraine used to export almost all its grain and oilseeds via seaports and now is forced to find new routes as its ports are blocked.
Before the war, Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain and oilseed a month, while in March the exports fell to 200,000 tonnes, Mykola Solskyi told the newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda.
There are currently 57 vessels with 1.25 million tonnes of grain and oilseeds," Solskyi said.
They certainly did not plan to keep this grain on the ships for a long time," he added.
He said importers were already spending more and the situation with grain supply from Ukraine could push these countries to build greater grain reserves and this would also drive up prices.
