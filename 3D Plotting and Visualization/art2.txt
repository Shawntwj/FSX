SHANGHAI: Japan's top representative in Shanghai urged China's most populous city to address concerns of Japanese businesses over losses and other disruptions caused by lockdowns aimed at containing a COVID-19 surge.
The US State Department on Monday ordered non-emergency US government workers to leave the consulate due to surging virus numbers and China's measures to control its spread.
The Shanghai government did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters on Saturday.
China's foreign ministry has termed the State Department concerns over coronavirus control measures in Shanghai "groundless accusations".
"However, with the extension of virus control measures, the situation of production and operations not being able to function normally has already lasted for more than a month," he said.
