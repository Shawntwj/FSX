Aid agencies report swarms of locusts have been descending on farms in northern Kenya, destroying crops and even leaving pastures bare of vegetation.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in a regional update on the pests says swarms have been detected this week in seven counties in Kenya compared to just four a week ago.

Across the Horn of Africa locust invasions have reached dangerous levels in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, according to the FAO.

""For Kenya this is a second wave,"" Hamisi Williams FAO deputy country representative for Kenya told Spice FM in Nairobi. ""The first wave came in 2020 and we dealt with it."" Kenya attacked the locusts with insecticides both from individual farmers on the ground and aerial spraying from planes. But other countries in the region ‚Äî ones with fewer resources and wracked by conflict including Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia ‚Äî didn't go after the bugs as aggressively.

""A lot of (locust) breeding happened in Ethiopia for the entire 2020. The same situation happened in Somalia,"" Williams said. ""We are now suffering the fate of our neighbors who just didn't do a good job for one reason or the other,"" in controlling the desert-dwelling grasshoppers.

But he concedes that part of the reason the locusts reproduced so rapidly was because of unusual rainfall patterns.

""We saw very intense rainfall in areas of northeastern (Kenya), where normally it's very dry,"" Williams said. ""Normally there would be nothing there for locusts to feed on. They wouldn't be able to survive there for long."" But that wasn't the case last year. ""And you got so much fodder which the locusts were able to feed on, and they were able to breed.""

The Famine Early Warning System says that several parts of the Horn of Africa currently are facing food crises driven in part by the surge in swarms of desert locusts. The warning system originally created by the U.S. Agency for International Development predicts the lack of adequate food will get even worse in the coming months. The areas expected to deteriorate the most are Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen.

Keith Cressman, the senior locust forecasting officer at the FAO based in Rome calls the desert locusts which are currently plaguing the region ""professional survivalists."" He says these insects ""are living in some of the harshest parts of the world. They're living in the Sahara desert, in the deserts of Arabia and southwest Asia. And when the rains do fall they have this capacity to take advantage of those exceptional occasions and reproduce very, very rapidly.""

Over a three month period a swarm of locusts can multiply 20 fold, Cressman says.

""The other thing is that they have this great capacity to migrate. So they don't get stuck in areas when conditions dry out. They just simply pick up and move to greener pastures,"" he says. They fly with the wind and can travel more than 100 miles in a day.

""They can easily cross the Red Sea so they can go from Sudan to Saudi Arabia in a day, for example,"" Cressman says of the biblical pests. ""They can easily cross from northern Somalia directly across the Indian Ocean to India and Pakistan.""

And when they arrive somewhere, they're incredibly destructive, ravenously devouring vegetation.

""Imagine a swarm the size of Manhattan in New York, which is not a very big swarm,"" he says. ""That single swarm in one day will eat the same amount of food as everybody in New York and California.""

For local farmers, the arrival of a cloud of locusts can spell doom. Since last year, FAO has helped to set up a fleet of 28 aircraft in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The planes both spot for swarms and carry out aerial spraying against them.

""We're not trying to exterminate the locusts, or eliminate them completely,"" Cressman says. ""We are just trying to bring them down to lower levels. Then natural predation, natural diseases, will manage the locusts as they normally do in most years."" But adding to the current woes of the region, even the funding for those aircraft is in danger of drying up.

The FAO Deputy Director-General Laurent Thomas is asking for an additional $40 million dollars to support the operation. ""The last time Africa saw an upsurge of locusts approaching this scale, in the Sahel, it took two years and more than $500 million to bring under control,"" Thomas said Tuesday in a statement. ""This (current) upsurge was even bigger, but East Africa is poised to end it ‚Äî provided governments can keep those aircraft flying."""

No time for complacency

Dominique Burgeon, FAO‚Äôs Director of Emergencies and Resilience, said the huge desert locust swarms in 2020, some as wide as 60 kilometres, had not been seen in decades, threatening food security in a region where many were already going hungry.

Surveillance and response led to 1.6 million hectares of land being treated. As a result, more than three million tonnes of cereals, valued at approximately $940 million, were protected: enough to feed 21 million people for a year.

‚ÄúWe can say that huge progress has been made, capacities of the countries have been tremendously augmented‚Ä¶but yet the situation is not over‚Äù, he told journalists.

‚ÄúWe have made a huge effort, we are much better prepared, but we should not be complacent. We should not relax.‚Äù

Swarms arriving ‚Äònearly every day‚Äô

Keith Cressman, FAO‚Äôs Senior Locust Forecasting Officer, said Cyclone Gati in December brought heavy rains, creating the conditions for new swarms to form in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia.

Locusts began migrating south to northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia when the waters dried up, as experts had predicted.

‚ÄúWe had forecasted this in October. We had provided early warning to both countries to expect this shortly after mid-December, and that‚Äôs indeed what happened‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúAnd since then, they have been arriving nearly every day.‚Äù

The locusts are young now but will mature, and reproduce, in the coming months. FAO anticipates a new generation will emerge in early April, coinciding with seasonal rains and the planting period in Kenya and southern Ethiopia.

Desert locusts are also breeding further north, on Somalia‚Äôs coastline on the Gulf of Aden, with new swarms likely to begin forming in late February.

‚ÄúThis is a cause of concern, and this is also why it‚Äôs extremely important that the control operations‚Ä¶are not disrupted‚Äù, said Mr. Cressman."

Locust swarms first soared in number in late 2019, as a result of unusual weather patterns amplified by climate change. They dispersed eastwards from Yemen leaving Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia hardest hit.

News of the swarms has left people resorting to any measures they can to get rid of them.

One farmer in Marsabit in northern Kenya tried to chase a swarm of locusts from his land by banging a stick against a jerry can, causing clouds of insects to swarm around him as they briefly flew off from his crops.

‚ÄúHe was trying to chase them... we helped him, but it was too much,‚Äù Ilias Iman Abdulkadir, a senior project officer at Catholic Relief Services based in Marsabit, told Reuters.

Abdulkadir said the situation was similar in the rest of Marsabit.

‚ÄúThe first wave just passed around the town, but this one actually came within the town, almost everyone came to see, people were very much scared,‚Äù he said.

The swarms are not limited to Kenya. Immature hoppers have also hatched in Ethiopia and Somalia.

""I am very desperate,"" he told DW. ""I was expecting a harvest to feed my family and take the children to school. Look at how my crops have been destroyed. Everything is gone now.""

The culprits are one of the world's oldest pests and probably have their most famous reference in the Old Testament's Book of Exodus: Locusts. In 2020, a plague of the hoppers invaded East Africa, ravaging crops and pastures and driving the level of human hunger and economic hardship higher in parts of the region. One year later, right at the start of 2021, the United Nations has warned that a second and maybe even deadlier re-invasion of locusts has already begun.

The locusts are breeding and multiplying at an alarming rate

Trillions of locusts in East Africa

The first wave of the pests emerged at the end of 2019, numbering in hundreds of billions, multiplying by a factor of 20 per generation, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The second generation in March and April numbered in the trillions. A plague that spread like wildfire ‚Äî up to now.

""It's a continuation of the 2020 locusts swarm. The adults have flown to various areas and are laying eggs"", Frances Duncan, Professor of Animal, Plant & Environmental Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, told DW. ""If we have good rains like it is the case at the moment in most areas, the hoppers will hatch, and we get the second wave of the swarm.""

However, Keith Cressman, FAO's Senior Locust Forecasting Officer, remains optimistic. ""I think it's still a very dangerous situation. But it should not be worse as it was last year."" According to the weather forecast, the months to come should be dry, reducing the locusts' reproductive rate.

Threatening food security

Kenya was heavily affected by the worst invasion of locusts in 70 years. In Garissa, the insects have driven farmers into despair: Their farms' total yields in 2020 were destroyed in less than 24 hours.

Nur Fadhil remembers that they had no chance against the plague. ""We have tried chasing the locusts away, but our efforts were in vain. The locusts spent the night on our farms. When we woke up the next day, they were still here. They had munched on everything on the farm. We have gone through massive losses,"" Fadhil said.

In an emergency case, the FAO is ready to step in, Cressman told DW in an interview. ""We are constantly monitoring the locusts' situation, the weather conditions, and provide service to all countries in the world in terms of early warning and forecasting so they can be prepared to respond."" The FAO is supporting control operations financially through pesticides, aircraft, and sprayers.

Cressman emphasized that the livelihoods of the population need to be protected. ""If a farmer has crops planted and his crop has been wiped out, and he does not have resources to buy new seeds to replant, the FAO can assist. For pastoralists, if there is not enough food for animals, the FAO can provide animal feed.""

Breeding in Ethiopia and Somalia

Five countries have been especially hard hit by the African migratory locusts: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. As a result, more than 35 million people suffer from food insecurity. FAO estimates this number could increase to 38.5 million if nothing is done to control the new infestation.

The FAO warns that numerous immature swarms have already formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, now they have reached northern Kenya. More swarms will arrive in January and spread throughout Ethiopia and Kenya.

""If the locust swarm is not controlled, it can completely destroy the crop and wipe out animal feed. This poses a serious threat to food security in the region and can lead to human and social crises,"" Amh Yeshewas Abay, Head of Natural Resources Office in South Omo Zone Hamer Woreda in Ethiopia, said in a DW interview. ""We are working to eradicate locusts in northern Kenya and on the border with Somalia.""

Danger of conflict

In northern Somalia, swarms laid eggs in areas affected by Cyclone Gati. Heavy rains in the region had turned out to favor the locusts, the UN says. New immature swarms could start to form in early February. Adult groups and a few swarms appeared on the coast of Sudan and Eritrea in December.

East Africa has seen the worst locust plague in decades

According to Daniel Lesego from Kenya's National Disaster Management Unit, the locust invasions come with multiple risks apart from food insecurity. ""If there will be competition over pasture, space, and water, then it is likely to trigger conflict, resource-based conflict, and that is something that we do not want to see in Kenya,"" he told DW. ""For us, this is a national call. It is a national duty that we are responding to and are committed to ensuring that locusts in Kenya are eradicated to make sure that locusts do not cross to our neighbors.""

Is East Africa prepared?

1.3 million hectares of locust invasion were treated across 10 countries since January last year to stave off an economic and agricultural catastrophe, according to the UN. Countries have prepared themselves to use pesticides on the ground and from the air. It helped to prevent the loss of around 2.7 million tons of cereal.

""Countries have been alerted to this possibility for a couple of months. They have been preparing, mobilizing their teams and getting them into the field to doing the monitoring, identifying locusts and doing ground control operations, supported by aerial operations,"" Cressman said, adding that the goal would now be to treat as many swarms as possible, ""before they spread, mature, and lay eggs for another generation of locusts.""

The Kenyan government has set aside $30 million (‚Ç¨24 million) to fight the second wave. Agriculture Minister Peter Munya told journalists that Kenya is well-equipped to fight the locust swarms and promised that in counties where crops and livestock have been lost, the government would intervene to help distribute seeds, cereals, clean water, or fertilizers.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Tiny but powerful Bark beetles, which reproduce in inner tree bark, have a killer reputation. And while some species of the bug do attack healthy trunks, they generally go for trees that are already diseased, dying or weak. Their role in forest ecology is a hotly contested issue, with some saying they provide an invaluable service and others insisting they are havoc-wreaking pests.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Fake fall The horse chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) takes its name from the trees it discolors. First observed in northern Greece in the mid eighties, it has since spread to other parts of Europe. Its larvae mine the leaves causing them to turn brown and drop before autumn takes its toll on other tree species. But the damage is not lasting. Come spring, they burst back into green life.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Danger in numbers The damage caused by plagues of locusts is well documented. Desert locusts in particular can swarm into groups of between 40 and 80 million creatures, devastating crops intended for human consumption. Capable of eating their own weight each day, a swarm as large as the one mentioned above, could devour more than 190 million kilos of plants on a daily basis.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers The holy snail trail With their long eyes and neat architectural design, a lot of people find snails cute and endearing. Not so farmers. These slimy little - and sometimes big - creatures are big eaters and will happily chomp their way through crops, such as lettuces, cabbage and broccoli leaving a trail of holes in their wake. Or in the case of smaller plants, tearing them to shreds.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Short, but busy lives Like so many pests, pea aphids take their name from their victim of choice. Which in this case means peas, though they also have a predeliction for clover and alfalfa. A mere 4 mm in length and only of this world for some 12 days, they suck the juice from their ""host"" plants, and are capable of killing them in the process. Oh and BTW: females can produce as many as 100 nymphs in their short lives.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Terrible termites Termites are more or less synomymous with mounds of earth and unsafe wooden constructions, but they also have a weakness for some plants - most notably maize. They hollow out the roots and base of the plant, first causing it to wilt, but in some cases later, to die. They also affect both tea and coffee plants, African palm oil, rubber and sugarcane. A varied appetite with a destructive outcome.

Tiny bugs with destructive powers Bad for bees Varroa mites are bad news for honey bees and can wipe out entire colonies. As parasites, they attach themselves to the bee's body and then suck out their host's bodily fluid, thereby weakening their immune systems and rendering them vulnerable to disease. The impact is not only bad for the bees themselves, but for crop pollination.

‚Ä¢ The Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG) recently conducted a regional Desert Locust impact assessment in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia using a harmonized approach. The assessment interviewed 7,871 agricultural respondents across Desert Locust-affected areas of the region between October and early December 2020.

‚Ä¢ The assessment found that roughly one third of cropping households and a half of livestockrearing households experienced Desert Locust-related pasture and crop losses.

‚Ä¢ For impacted households, Desert Locust losses were often quite large. More specifically, nearly 7 out of every 10 impacted cropping and livestock-rearing respondents experienced high or very high losses to their crops and rangeland.

‚Ä¢ Considering only areas included in both Round 1 (conducted in June/July) and Round 2 (conducted in October/November/December), a comparison of the two round‚Äôs data shows significant declines in the percentage of respondents observing Desert Locusts and related losses in Kenya, relative stability or slight declines in Ethiopia, and mixed results in Somalia.

‚Ä¢ Beyond direct crop and rangeland impacts, Desert Locust affected respondents also commonly expressed concerns that Desert Locusts were driving increased food insecurity/malnutrition, emotional stress/anxiety, issues relating to animal and human health, environmental impacts, and high costs of control.

‚Ä¢ Due to multiple, compounding hazards (e.g. Desert Locusts, below-average rains, etc.), there was general pessimism amongst respondents (both those affected by Desert Locusts and those who were not) about harvest prospects and current rangeland conditions. In the areas where the highest percentage of respondents reported poor pasture availability or that harvests would be below average, Desert Locusts were identified as a key driver of current conditions.

‚Ä¢ Food insecurity amongst the interviewed agricultural respondents was found to be high with more than 20 percent of respondents in most of the assessed areas reported a reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI) exceeding 18, the threshold for Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse. The highest prevalences of food insecurity were observed in ten administrative areas in Ethiopia (Nogob, Jarar, Shabelle, Korahe, Borena, West Harerge, Doolo, Siti, Fafan, and South Omo). Additionally, major deteriorations in food insecurity amongst agricultural households were found between Round 1 (conducted in June/July) and Round 2 (conducted in October/November/December) in Awdal, Galgaduud, and Woqooyi Galbeed in Somalia and in Guji, Hareri, Korahe, Siti, and South Omo in Ethiopia. Given already high levels of food insecurity, current challenges to crop and livestock production threaten to drive further food security deteriorations."

However, XAG's agricultural drones with night-operation mode are able to join the locust ""air force"" under certain circumstances.
Fitted with four rotary atomisers, XAG's agricultural drones can operate fully autonomous on a predetermined path and deliver uniform sprays three metres above the targeted locust swarms.
The first step is to survey and map the fields before sunset in which locust swarms are identified.
""During daytime, the locust swarms spread out over an extremely large area and stay mobile in the air for long periods.","agriculture, locust, swarms, outsmart, xag, suggests, night, locusts, africa, agricultural, zambia, drones, spraying, xags",locust,idiosyncratic,"The unusually rapid spreading of locusts in Africa is largely the result of erratic weather associated with climate change. Prolonged rains lead to moist, humid desert lands and flourishing vegetation, which creates a conducive environment for locust swarms to breed freely.

According to the FAO Desert Locust situation updated on 22 January, the Greater Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, is the most-affected region witnessing the arrival of more immature swarms. The estimated above-the-average rainfalls brought by Cyclone Gati cause the swarms to complete maturation and lay eggs. This will give rise to multiple generations to be born during February and March, again putting food security and the livelihoods of rural households in danger since the last upsurge turned calm in July 2020.

Finding versatile, easy-to-use new tools to tackle these notorious locusts becomes more urgent when local farmers and response teams have been struggling to contain them. In times of this crisis, drones provide an innovative complementary solution to the more expensive manned aircraft or the less effective manual spraying method. They can be used to conduct ultra-low-volume (ULV) precision spraying of chemical or biological pesticides to kill the locusts, especially in the impacted areas otherwise inaccessible for ground vehicles and aeroplanes.

When the locust swarms are unscrupulously flying and densely-packed during day, it is suggested unsafe and ineffective for drones to carry out spraying operations. However, XAG's agricultural drones with night-operation mode are able to join the locust ""air force"" under certain circumstances. They can either target the wingless nymphs and hopper bands at the early stage, or launch an attack when the flying adults settle down after sunset.

The use of unmanned devices is also expected to help lessen the strain on supplies and human resources that are needed to suppress the locust outbreaks in the poverty-stricken regions of Africa. Fitted with four rotary atomisers, XAG's agricultural drones can operate fully autonomous on a predetermined path and deliver uniform sprays three metres above the targeted locust swarms. This means that less sophisticated skills of the field operators are required, while reducing the quantities of pesticides used to minimum level. Such unmanned technology therefore shows strengths to fight a locust invasion amid travelling restrictions and social distancing imposed due to COVID-19.

The Night Guard to Protect Livelihoods

In a recent demonstration of drone spraying, Sunagri Investment Zambia Limited, as XAG's global partner in Africa, has put forward the new ideas of night-time locust control to the Ministry of Agriculture and Zambia Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). It is now on track to get its XAG gear ready for possible locust outbreak during the upcoming dry season. Sunagri offers precision crop-spraying service with XAG's agricultural drones in Zambia, Uganda and Tanzania, helping farmers sustainably treat pest diseases and reap the benefits of improved yields. In 2019, XAG has worked with Sunagri to provide drone interventions that yielded success to manage the crop-devouring fall armyworm.

Fraser Zhang, the owner of Sunagri Zambia, explained the solution on how to apply drones more effectively to support the locust control operations. The first step is to survey and map the fields before sunset in which locust swarms are identified. Then drones can be deployed at night to concentrate their spraying forces against swarms which become inactive and rest on trees or on the ground after sunset.

""During daytime, the locust swarms spread out over an extremely large area and stay mobile in the air for long periods. Their dynamic movement makes them much more difficult to be contained. But at night, what we would aim for are static objects which can be accurately sprayed,"" said Zhang.

The Desert locusts are one of the species of short-horned grasshoppers, which have been considered the world's most destructive migratory pest. They usually form into a swarm whose density can reach up to a whopping 80 million per square kilometre, eating massive amounts of crops and vegetations and leaving people inflicted with food losses. The locusts can reproduce exponentially, and if left unchecked, a group of its population would multiply 20-fold in only three months and grow 400 times in half a year.

According to the United Nation, since January 2020, the hungry desert locusts have swept across dozens of countries in Africa and Southwest Asia, some of which reported the worst locust upsurge in decades. The Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen are the epicentre of crisis, with over 48 million people facing acute food insecurity.

Zambia also experienced a similar infestation on 300,000 hectares of land in 2020, but by a different species called African Migratory Locusts (AML). ""The Western Province of Zambia is worst-hit by the locusts. It is anticipated that the mature swarms have already laid eggs at this point, which will hatch and lead to a new wave of invasions in coming months,"" said Fraser Zhang.

With more extreme weather events making frequent occurrences, the locust crisis is not likely to fade away very soon. We should be racing to test new tools and technologies such as agricultural drones which would help better respond to any outbreaks now and in the future.

Nairobi/New York/Rome, 19 January 2021 - A locust fighting force assembled by countries in East Africa to combat an invasion of the crop-devouring pest is at risk of seeing its activities grind to a halt as funding to sustain its operations dries up, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warned today.

Without additional financing for fuel, airtime, and pilot hours, the 28 anti-locust aircraft which are now patrolling the skies to spot and spray locust swarms could cease operations in March, the Organization told partners at a virtual briefing event today.

""The locust fighting machine that has been assembled in East Africa is now fully equipped and able to contain, suppress and we believe, eventually end this record-breaking upsurge,"" said FAO Deputy Director-General Laurent Thomas.

""Governments have built up capacity in record-time. Swarms have been massively reduced in number and in size. It would be tragic to throw these achievements away just as the nations of East Africa are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Thomas said, adding: ""There is a real possibility they could bring this upsurge to an end this year, but they need to be able to continue doing what they are doing, without faltering.""

Some $33.8 million in additional funding will be needed to allow that to happen through June, FAO informed humanitarian partners at today's briefing, urging them to help East Africa and Yemen get through the last mile of their desert locust marathon.

A quantum leap in readiness

When the first wave of locusts first exploded across East Africa in early January 2020, fuelled by heavy rains dumped by an abnormally late season cyclone, many countries had little or no capacity to monitor movements of the pest or mount control activities at scale. Indeed, most had not seen a locust incursion of such magnitude in over 50 years.

Now, one year on, with FAO support they have succeeded in fielding a locust fighting force in the air and on the ground that involves 28 airplanes and helicopters, 260 ground units, and some 3,000 newly trained spotters and control operators.

Over 6,000 hours of air sorties have been flown to spot and spray infestations of the pest. New innovations such as the eLocust3 digital tools, satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, and trajectory models have been harnessed to report locusts in real-time and deliver maps of infestations, breeding areas, and migration routes.

More than 1.5 million hectares of land have been treated in East Africa and Yemen since the start of the campaign in January 2020.

FAO estimates these efforts helped avoid crop and dairy losses worth an estimated at $1.2 billion, safeguarding the livelihoods of 28 million people.

2021 is not 2020 all over again

While the locusts remain a threat, East Africa is starting off 2021 on a much better footing.

The upsurge that started last January has been sustained by consistently favourable weather conditions ever since, causing a cascade of reproduction that saw an unusually large population of the pest disperse and persist across the region, notwithstanding the successful large-scale control operations that were scaled up to meet the threat.

And in recent months, heavy rains and another late-season cyclone sparked a new round of breeding, causing more swarms to form. As a result, Kenya and southern Ethiopia are currently being re-invaded, after having beat back the first incursion last year. Even the United Republic of Tanzania recently witnessed a swarm in the northeast.

But despite this renewed activity, the situation today is not at all the same as it was 12 months ago, thanks to generous donor support, according to FAO.

For one, the countries of the region are now prepared, equipped, and ready.

Secondly, the numbers of Desert Locusts are much reduced, with fewer swarms of decreased density and size.

For instance, one mega-swarm detected last year in Kenya covered 240 000 hectares of land, an area the size of Luxembourg. Today, however, control teams are treating smaller swarms of 100-1 000 hectares or so at a time.

""The last time Africa saw an upsurge of locusts approaching this scale, in the Sahel, it took two years and more than $500 million to bring under control. This upsurge was even bigger, but East Africa is poised to end it -- provided governments can keep those aircraft flying,"" said FAO's Thomas.

Several immature swarms arrived on the Red Sea coast and Asir Mountains in southwest Saudi Arabia during the past week. These swarms are likely to have originated from adjacent coastal and highland areas in northern Yemen that cannot be accessed safely. Substantial control operations are in progress against early and mid-instar hopper groups and bands on the Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia from Jizan to Al Wajh. In Yemen, scattered adults are present on the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts that have not required control so far.

In the Horn of Africa, immature swarms continue to arrive and disperse throughout northern and central Kenya. In the past two days, swarms have been reported in 10 counties (Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Marsabit, Samburu, Laikipia, Meru North, Meru Central, and Tharaka). So far, only a few swarms have started to mature. In the southeast, fledging occurred near Taita Taveta and a few late instar hopper bands were present along the coast.

In Ethiopia, immature swarms have moved into Afar and eastern Amhara regions while other immature swarms continue to be present and are spreading out in parts of Oromia and SNPP regions. Immature swarms persist south of Jijiga and a few remain in parts of the eastern Somali region where it is drying out. There is a risk that a few swarms could continue to move from Afar into Amhara and Tigray and perhaps reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and Saudi Arabia. Swarms will mature shortly and start laying eggs mainly in Oromia and SNNP.

In Somalia, hopper groups and bands are present on the northwest coast and in the northeast where laying is still ongoing. Some swarms have remained in central areas (Mudug, Galgaduud) where they are mature and may breed in any favourable places. Immature swarms are present in the south where they continue to move to Kenya.

As conditions remain dry in some parts of southern and northern Ethiopia and north-central Kenya, the swarms are likely to spread out looking for favourable areas to mature and lay eggs if rains fall in the coming weeks. This would give rise to hopper bands during February and March. Intense aerial and ground control operations are in progress to reduce the current swarms so that the scale of the upcoming breeding may be lower.

Breeding continues along the Red Sea coastal plains on both sides of the Eritrea/**Sudan** border where control teams are treating hopper groups and bands. Similar breeding is in progress in Wadi Diib in northeast Sudan."

In the Horn of Africa, immature swarms continue to migrate southwards from breeding areas in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia to southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. There were reports that a few immature swarms reached Mwanga district in northeast Tanzania on 8 January 2021.

In Ethiopia, immature swarms are concentrating along the eastern side of the Harar Highlands in Oromia region as they move to southern areas of the country, including southern parts of the Rift Valley in SNNP region. There are also cross-border movements near Jijiga and northwest Somalia and along the southern border with Kenya.

In Kenya, immature swarms continue to arrive and spread throughout the north. So far, swarms are present in four counties (Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit and, most recently, Isiolo). Breeding continues, and hopper bands are present in the southeast near Taita Taveta and along the coast.

In Somalia, mature swarms are present in the northwest and breeding is in progress on the coast where hopper bands have formed. Breeding also continues in the northeast where numerous hopper bands are concentrated between Iskushuban and Bosaso. Breeding may also be underway in other areas on the northern plateau that received heavy rains from cyclone Gati. Immature swarms continue to move southwards in central and southern regions towards Kenya.

Control operations continue in all affected countries.

As conditions are dry in some areas where the swarms are arriving, they are expected to disperse throughout southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. There is a moderate risk that a few swarms could reach central Kenya and perhaps the southwest as well as northeast Tanzania, eastern Uganda, and southeast South Sudan during January. Once swarms arrive in favourable areas, they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and cause hopper bands to form during February and March.

Elsewhere, breeding is underway along both sides of the Red Sea coast. Hopper groups and bands are present along both sides of the Sudan/**Eritrea** border. Scattered solitarious adults prevail along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coastal plains in Yemen, and one mature swarm appeared in the northern highlands from the coast.

GOAL Ethiopia is responding to a new desert locust infestation which is threatening agricultural livelihoods and food security for thousands across the country. The latest threat comes a year after locust swarms affected millions of people across East Africa.

Last year‚Äôs outbreak was the worst recorded in Kenya for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of insects also swarmed into neighbouring nations, such as Somalia and Ethiopia. A new locust outbreak could now compound an already bleak food security situation in Ethiopia. 8.6 million people currently face high levels of food insecurity, due to Covid-19, displacement and high food prices.

Collective action needed to fight new outbreak

Early last year, swarms of desert locusts started to spread across countries in the Horn of Africa, devastating crops and people‚Äôs livelihoods. To avoid a humanitarian crisis, the UN called for collective action. Up to $194 million was raised to fight the outbreak last year. One year on, the agency has said that $80 million could now be needed to control the scourge in the coming months.

The UN has warned that immature swarms in the Horn of Africa have been migrating southwards from breeding areas in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia to southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. In Ethiopia, the swarms are concentrating along the eastern side of the Harar Highlands in Oromia region as they move to southern areas of the country.

Many regions are already suffering with other food insecurity threats

12 local administrative areas in the Teltelle district of the Oromia Region of Ethiopia are now seriously affected. Dinkneh Asfaw, GOAL Ethiopia‚Äôs Country Director, says that communities in the Teltelle district are struggling to cope with the new infestation.

‚Äò‚ÄòThis community has not had time to recover from the last year‚Äôs outbreak. They are even more vulnerable to this new risk. The infestation is now impacting 3,211 households and a total area of 3,275 hectares of crop land and almost 8,000 hectares of grazing lands. The food security situation could be even more serious, as erratic rain in the area is expected to decrease much of the crop yield that was cultivated during 2020,‚Äô‚Äô he added.

The new locust outbreak has also impacted the districts of Dillo and Dhas, with thousands of hectares being affected in both regions. Last year, thanks to support from ECHO and Irish Aid, GOAL supported local authorities with infestation control measures, helping over 9,000 families protect their farms from the insects and through distribution of cash assistance of multiple rounds in Teltele and Elwaye districts in Borena zone. GOAL teams are currently identifying the needs of local communities before offering financial assistance and seed support.

Early control measures critical

Desert Locusts are considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world, devouring large areas of crops and grasses meant for people and livestock. According to the UN‚Äôs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a swarm of 40-80 million locusts can consume the amount of food equivalent to that eaten by 35,000 people in a day.

Strengthening early detection and control measures are critical in the fight against locust infestations. And a vital tool for farmers in the wider battle against food insecurity.

David Lindsay, a senior LLS biosecurity officer, based at Warialda, said he had seen banding locusts building in areas such as Mungindi, North Star, Yetman, Boggabilla, Croppa Creek and Moree.

He said the next few weeks would be critical for spraying to gain control of the pest.

""We are still in the timeframe at the moment, but it is starting to get towards the end of that,"" he said.

""The next week will be a crucial time.

""[Locusts] will start to disperse, and once that occurs, it gets a little bit too late. Once they start flying around it, is just impossible to spray them.""

Mr Lindsay said it was critical landholders reported locusts and monitored populations to get them under control before they caused widespread damage to summer crops and early winter crops.

""If we do that, we will stop them from fledging and going through the next cycle and laying more eggs,"" he said.

Mice continue to be a problem

Mr Kelly said large populations of mice had been active in the region for months, with numerous baiting programs carried out by farmers.

""That's another headache we have had, especially some sorghum that has been planted into double-crop country.

""Mice were obviously active in the winter crop, and when the fresh seeds of sorghum went into the ground they busily went in there and ate it, so we've had to bait some of them as well,"" he said."

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards.

In northern Somalia, swarms laid eggs in areas affected by Cyclone Gati where hatching is underway and causing numerous early instar hopper bands to form. Hatching will continue until about mid-January. New immature swarms could start to form in early February.

In Saudi Arabia, swarms that appeared during December on the Red Sea coast, perhaps from Yemen, laid eggs that are hatching and causing numerous hopper bands to form. Some swarms also reached interior areas where they will slowly mature and breed once temperatures warm up.

Adult groups and a few swarms appeared on the coast of Sudan and Eritrea in December. Breeding is continuing, albeit on a smaller scale than Saudi Arabia, which will cause further hatching that will cause hopper groups and bands to form.

In Yemen, control has not been required so far because locusts are solitarious and scattered along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts. However, breeding will cause locusts to increase, leading to a new generation of hopper groups and bands that will require control from about late January onwards.

In the Western Region, locusts that concentrated and formed small groups were treated in Mauritania, Niger, and Algeria during December.

In southwest Asia, adult groups in southwest Iran will eventually breed once temperatures warm up.

During December, aerial and ground control operations treated more than 336 000 ha. Nevertheless, intensive monitoring and control efforts will need to be maintained and extended to all breeding areas."

In the past few days, there have been new reports from northeast Ethiopia of swarms in Afambo, Asayita and Dubti districts of the Afar region as well as in North and South Wollo zones in eastern Amhara region. The swarms are likely to have arrived from the Sitti zone near Dire Dawa and northwest Somalia. There is a risk that the swarms could continue to move further into Amhara and reach the Tigray region. Elsewhere, immature swarms are present in Oromia and SNPP regions.

In Kenya, several immature swarms continue to arrive from the north, mainly appearing in the northeast and east, from where they are spreading west into northern and central counties. Swarms have now been reported in 11 counties (Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Turkana, Samburu, Laikipia, Isiolo, Meru North, Meru Central, and Tharaka) compared to seven at the beginning of this week. So far, only a few swarms have started to mature. In the southeast, fledging is in progress near Taita Taveta, causing small immature swarms to form while a few late instar hopper bands are present along the coast.

As conditions remain dry in some areas, the swarms are expected to disperse throughout southern and northern Ethiopia and north-central Kenya. Any rainfall that occurs in the coming weeks while cause swarms to mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands during February and March.

Intense ground and aerial control operations are in progress in both countries to reduce current swarm populations so that the scale of the upcoming breeding may be lower."

According to the FAO report covering January‚ÄìJuly 2020, a very small locust swarm is capable of eating the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people. ‚ÄúA typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometre and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day,‚Äù the report said.

‚ÄúThe swarms could continue to central Kenya and perhaps a few swarms could reach the equatorial region in the southeast corner of South Sudan as well [as] in eastern Uganda,‚Äù says Keith Cressman, a senior forecasting officer at the FAO.

The current swarms are likely to concentrate in areas with natural vegetation in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, but they could spread further into the East African region, already reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a World Health Organization report last week (19 January), Ethiopia ranked eighth in the WHO African region for new COVID-19 cases, with 2,980 recorded in the previous week.

An FAO report released yesterday warns that if it rains in the coming weeks, the swarms could spread as they look for conditions that would help them to mature and lay eggs.



Cressman explains that in the Middle East, breeding is underway along both sides of the Red Sea, mainly on the coast of Saudi Arabia where a mass of hoppers moving as a unit are present along a 1,000 kilometre stretch.

He says that control measures have included aerial and ground spraying using bio-pesticides, adding that there are two dozen aircraft undertaking aerial survey and control operations in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya.

‚ÄúSo far, more than 1.5 million hectares have been treated in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen. This has saved some 2.7 metric tonnes of crop production, which is equivalent to US$800 million and would feed 18 million people for one year,‚Äù Cressman says.

‚ÄúMore than 1.2 million households including more than 20 million people have been reached to safeguard livelihoods in the region in an intervention estimated to cost US$1 billion.‚Äù

Stephen Lekipasharan, a pastoralist from Kenya‚Äôs semi-arid Isiolo County, says that locust attack in 2020 nearly wiped out his livestock, and drove him from the only place he calls home.

‚ÄúThey devoured every green vegetation in their path, rendering the land desolate,‚Äù Lekipasharan tells SciDev.Net. ‚ÄúWe had to escape to the neighbouring Laikipia County with our animals to save our lives.‚Äù

Cressman says that smarter and more sustainable control approaches are needed in the face of an imminent large-scale locust resurgence and as funding starts to dry up amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A potential solution could be an artificial intelligence-powered tool known as Kuzi that uses satellite data, soil sensor data, ground meteorological observation, and machine learning to predict the breeding, occurrence and migration routes of desert locust, according to John Oroko, one of the brains behind Kuzi app and the CEO of Selina Wamucii, the Kenya-based company that developed it.

The device uses a machine-learning model trained to obtain satellite data of soil moisture, wind, humidity, surface temperature, as well as soil sensor data and vegetation index ‚Äîall factors that affect the breeding, swarm formation, and movement of locusts.

Local communities can also receive mobile phone text messages as alerts when locusts are likely to attack farms in their areas, including forage for livestock so that they can prepare well in advance, Oroko adds.

Ambrose Ngetich, locust control field officer in Isiolo, Kenya, says that efforts to control locusts need to be stepped up to avert conflicts.

‚ÄúIn a pastoral region like Isiolo, locust invasion is not just an economic issue, it is also a security issue because loss of pasture due to the locust can lead to serious conflict over resources,‚Äù Ngetich says.
